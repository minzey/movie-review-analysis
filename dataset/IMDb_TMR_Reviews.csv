0,"Warning Spoilers.First part of the movie, tried to be some kind of self-ironic introspective on the state of movies and even made a direct reference to a Matrix sequel. Now the problem with that kind of commentary is that you effectively break the 4th wall or ruin any idea that this isn't just a movie.The film then stumbles towards some kind of plot about the new matrix and Neo/Trinity but fails miserably.The ending is a bore fest of mindless dark action (I mean filmed in the dark) with no tension or point.Did they have a budget of 10m and a timeline of a week to make this film, it certainly looks like it.The original Matrix, in my opinion, is the best film ever made. It has perfect pacing, actions, beautifully realised, cool conversations, properly filmed and choreographed action scenes and even manages a philosophical theme, with all that going on. There is tension, people may and do die, there is a purpose to what they want to achieve. It had a serious tone. It established a set of rules, which is crucial to this type of movie. It was an against-the-odds film.In this, the fights are meaningless, badly filmed, just thrown in for no reason. Neo now just has a super-power and that's it. There is no tension, no one dies, nothing is really at stake, the FX are terrible. When Neo realises, he has Kung Fu abilities again, he has zero reaction, nothing.Did anyone believe the Japanese train was real? The casting is awful, did anyone care about any of the characters and their terrible acting. It looked rushed, cheap, and amateurish.The mocking of the original film and it dialog was sacrilege and childish. Showing actual film footage and claiming it was game footage, really?I suspect the comment at the beginning of the movie, about having to make a sequel, was genuine, so they made the worse film they could.",3
1,"Some kind of fan-fiction? Did they write 5 scripts and couldn't decide on which one to go with so the blended them together? This was not a Matrix movie by any stretch of the imagination. Even worse than Reloaded or Revolutions. This was a mess of a movie, and the action scenes made no sense. I don't know who the fight choreographer was, but they must have been sold a bill of goods with whoever they went with. Also, Neo can fight, then he can't, then he can? Also, the action in the other Matrix movies (even the bad ones) you could tell what was going on. This seemed like every time there was a fight scene in this one, they used a lot of shaky cam/quick cuts so the action was incomprehensible. If you are going to bring The Matrix back for another installment after almost 20 years, you had better have something special, as the original Matrix used all the newest technology available at the time to tell an already awesome story. This one, they tried to make action scenes (which were awful) to cover up the fact that they had nothing to add to The Matrix story, and both together were just embarrassing. 5 stars only because Keanu Reeves was in this. I don't know why he agreed to do it, but he was there, I don't think he brought his A game, but he was, in fact, in the movie. That's about all I can say, no one in this movie looked exited to be making it.",
2,If the SyFy channel made a Matrix series it would look like this. So much about this is way off. The editing and pacing. Shot composition. Fight scenes. Lighting... All of it looks cheap and nasty and that's just the 1st 10 mins.,2
3,"I had been holding off from watching The Matrix Resurrections for fear of disappointment, but I eventually took the red pill and went down the rabbit hole, hoping I would party like it was 1999. I hate to say it, but the party is well and truly over: The Matrix Reloaded peed in the punch, and Revolutions made a right royal mess of the bathroom, but Resurrections calls the police, who break down the door and arrest everyone for disturbing the peace. In short, a good time is not had by all.Keanu Reeves, sporting his strange half-beard and lank hair, once again plays Neo, who has been resurrected by the machines and plugged back into the Matrix as top games designer Thomas Anderson, famous for his groundbreaking Matrix series (how meta!). Thomas is approached by some alternative types with stupid names and stupid hair who convince him that his life is a lie and extract him from the matrix. After regaining his mojo (kung fu skills and stopping bullets in mid-air), Neo and his new pals attempt to rescue Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who is still being used as a battery by the machines.Part four in the franchise, directed by Lana Wachowski, should have been called The Matrix Regurgitations for it is content to deliver exactly the same kind of nonsense as seen almost two decades ago in Reloaded and Revolutions, namely lots of shooting, lots of fighting, lots of explosions, lots of CGI, and an incomprehensible load of old cyber-crap masquerading as a plot. In short, it's a big case of déjà vu (see what I did there?). Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne had the good sense to stay away from this embarrassing attempt to flog an old horse to death; I bet Christina Ricci and Neil Patrick Harris wish they had followed suit.",3
4,"The directors, writers and producers could have done something decent, respectable, but they were wrong about everything.Bad execution, bad effects, bad plot, very poor camera effects compared to its predecessors. And the script is the most incorrect, disastrous of all. It leaves many plot holes such as ""Since when Trinity has so many abilities that Neo, when in their first three installments they don't talk or mention it"". And this is just one of its many weak points.It cannot be claimed that being or trying to make a comic satire of his previous films can be accepted, on the contrary. They should have taken advantage of these almost 20 years to do a better job but they wasted it.",1
5,What even was this? This was so dumb. What were they thinking when they were making this movie the dialogue is corny and the fight scenes were lame asf. Why was this even made?,1
6,"After ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" I knew that the odds were better than good that ""Resurrections"" was going to be awful. Still, I went against my better judgment and went to see it. Part of it has to do with a false hope and part of it has to do with the dearth of movies to watch in theater.The movie is called ""Resurrections"" because ""duh,"" Neo (Keanu Reeves) is resurrected along with Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). I won't even go into the ridiculous mumbo jumbo spouted out to explain their resurrection. It all made as much sense as the Architect did in ""Revolutions."" Just know that Neo was magically back as was Trinity. Morpheus (Yahya Abdul Mateen) was back in some cyborg manner and Agent Smith (Jonathan Groff) was a younger version. I think it's telling that both Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving were not a part of this project. I think they saw the script and thought better of having such a stain on their resumes.You know a movie is bad when they spoof themselves within the movie. You'll occasionally see that in vapid sequels that are fresh out of ideas such as Scream 3 and 4 or ""New Nightmare"" (A Nightmare on Elm Street 6). In the beginning of ""Resurrections"" Neo was back to being Thomas Anderson. He was a game designer who had designed a game called ""The Matrix."" Basically, the three previous Matrix movies were all just designs of his. His coworkers spent way too much screen time discussing what the Matrix was supposed to mean and what a new Matrix video game should be. It was quite pathetic seeing the movie try so hard to make it seem like everything that had occurred was all Mr. Anderson's imagination. It was a forced plot if there ever was one.To further drive home that the movie wasn't going to generate anything fresh and new, there were frequent insertions of scenes from Matrixes past. There were probably a dozen or more clips from the older movies thrust into ""Resurrections"" to either refresh the viewer's memory or add content that was actually good. All that does is denigrate the movie at hand because you're constantly being reminded of how good it was. It's as if the production team gave up already and conceded that what people yearn for is the original but we will never be able to amount to that, so here are some clips from the original as a supplement. Even the way the archive footage was shoehorned in there showed a lack of creativity or concern.I could rant on about the putridness of this movie, but what would be the point? It was long, slow, boring, talkative, emotionless, and unexciting. Nothing about it was new, fresh, or stimulating. The fighting was the same as were the outfits and copious bullets fired. This movie was just a stale remake dressed as a sequel, but I deserved what I got because I knew better.",2
7,"Everything felt cheap ..... it didnt look like a matrix movie, the bar was set too high in 1999 by first Matrix.I didnt like how they forced the female character to be the muscle and made Neo as a weak old lady.",3
8,"The ending of the matrix was fine, now they did this movie that makes close to zero sense.Everyone is older, the movie makes no sense... ok the FX and action is good but other then that, there is nothing going on.Its a weird movie to be honest. Neo wanting to do everything to save trinity and ready to put the lives of millions in danger to do so and so much more nonsense like that.",4
9,"Laughingly bad. Filled with loads of ""Remember this?"" flashbacks and obnoxious slow-mo and blur. Dull and confusing story, dumb dialogue, and crap action sequences you won't remember at all. Another rehash stinker. Just a quick cash-grab and all the talent from the original Matrix trilogy is gone and left with a movie that wasn't needed in the first place.3/10.",3
10,"Blah blah blah = how much talking and exposition is in this movie. The original matrix had a lot of talking too, but every conversation is intriguing. In this movie, it bored me to death. Almost put me to sleep.Blah blah blah = the mess of a story that is this movie. It's all over the place and feels like a bunch of nonsense mashed together.Blah blah blah = the unclear and uninspiring action. The fight scenes in the first two movie are amongst the best ever put to screen, including Asian cinema. The action in Reloaded is incredible. In this movie, it just feels like action vomit all over the screen. It ranges from mediocre to bad. And only one part is memorable (certain things are falling onto the street). The fight scenes suffer from close ups and quick cuts, something we never see in the originals.The more I think about it, a 4 star rating seems generous. But that's how I felt leaving the theater. There is some good here. But I don't think I'd bother giving it another chance. (1 viewing, 12/23/2021)",4
11,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Matrix"" (1999) is in my TOP 3 movies of all time. I was a teenager when it came out and i basically grew up with it. I liked ""Reloaded"" and even ""Revolutions"" was pretty OK movie.Cut to almost 20 years later and we have ""The Matrix Resurrections"" (2021). I was exited after the amazing trailer, yet the track record of movies that Wachowski made after ""Revolutions"" was not giving many hopes. And after seeing latest one on a premier day just now i can say that ""Resurrections"" is the worst movie I've seen in many moons, unfortunately. It was excruciatingly bad.Story was a mess. Writing was horrible. It was so poorly written that audience was started to laugh at things that were not supposed to be funny. Directing was terrible. The only good thing in this disaster was Jessica Henwick's acting - she was good. And Keanu Reeves just sleepwalked trough the whole thing.Overall, ""Resurrections"" felt like a parody of the original trilogy - i kid you not. You have to see by yourself Jada Pinkett Smith's Niobe to believe it - and i will say nothing more. It literally felt like a sequel to ""Battlefield Earth"" (2000) rather to one of the best films ever made. On the other hand - in its 2 h 20 min run time it wasn't boring - with my broken heart i can safely say that ""The Matrix Resurrections"" was so bad that it was actually fun to watch. One day thins might become a cult classic, but not in a good way.Terrible movie in every single possible way.",2
12,"Back then the first Matrix movie was a revelation, for sure one of the best movies made in the 90s. I also liked the sequels a lot - despite some flaws here and there. Anyway, The Matrix Resurrections is what I expected and feared - a very mediocre movie compared to the original trilogy. Who needs this one? Why was it even made - the story was told and Resurrections adds nothing really new or any good. Like that new Resident Evil fail, this one I watched once and I will most likely never put on a screen again: I will take the blue pill and forget its existence...",4
13,"The three previous Matrix, you could sense the fear the humans had when entering the Matrix or interactions with the machines. These new characters treated it like it was their neighborhood playground and had no worries of death. It was laughable!... I said characters because I actually don't even remember none of their names.",1
14,I had a horrible feeling 2 minutes into the film it was going to be bad. The film is very off. No Morpheus no Matrix and what is with the incessant need to show clips from the original film every minute like we don't know what they are referring to.It feels like they made this to a younger audience who have never heard of The Matrix and needed reminding with the constant references to the first.I feel sick.,3
15,"Morpheus was a smart, profound man who left the impression of a kung fu monk. This new one is an antipathetic character that I wouldn't follow anywhere, even if my own life depends on it.These new characters they did don't inspire and don't have that intellectual depth. The only thing good about this film are the moments of fights, CGI, and of course, it's nice to see Niobe, Trinity, and Neo.However, when you get to The Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) speech or to The Analyst (Patrick Haris), you come back to IMDB and edit your rating from ""terrible"" to ""hm, ok"".Haha :D The song from credits. My God, this modern-day society killed everything. This is embarrassing.",3
16,"Since my movie watching habits were very late, I generally like very bad movies. I was very excited for The Matrix 4.But... But... But...The movie is awful.Even though the movie was bad, I still went to the cinema. The movie was boring.The script was bad.The footage was bad.The fights and action were terrible.The first part of the movie was a parody movie, the second part was a cheap action movie, and the third part was a zombie movie.Most people liked the first parts of the movie, but I didn't like it at all.Agent Smith and Morpheus were not good in this movie. Morpheus was an insult to the original Morpheus.This movie was not needed. This movie is an insult to the Matrix movies.",4
17,"Original Matrix was a very interesting movie, pretty original and with real artistic value.The second was an attempt to go deeper on the same theme(s), but, it didn't work out very well.The third one was an attempt to wrap things up. It got a little silly near the end, but, it still had _some_ sense of purpose and meaning.But, this... it's completely lost in... well, it's own matrix.Yes, there are a few interesting ideas, like Thomas Anderson making a gaming trilogy that is like the real Matrix movie trilogy and (some) machines siding with humans. But, there are very few.There's one joke that works, but is ruined shortly afterwards. Many attempts at mocking Laurence Fishburne's take on Morpheus land very, very badly. The whole concept of ""The One"", which is the whole point of the trilogy is shattered to pieces with the concept of ""The Pair""... Actually, the whole conclusion of the trilogy is essentially thrown out the window. Just because it wasn't very good and a lot of people didn't like it, doesn't mean you can just pretend like it didn't happen - at least, if you want to do that, explain it somehow, like, make it a dream or some such thing.It's boring a _lot_ of the time. Barney Stinson of HIMYM fame is completely wasted here, even though the general idea of casting him as the Analyst makes some sense, but he both has a few jokes and gags and they are so bad, nobody could pull them off. The next generation leader, which is, of course, a girl, speaks very fast and strange, I could not understand her most of the time. The end with Trinity performing meaningless violence against Barney Stinson is meaningless (he's a computer program, it has no real effect), out of character for her and for Neo who's being a voyeur of the whole silly thing...And, at long last, Priyanka Chopra ain't no Monica Bellucci, not even close.It kind of feels like a very high-end fan film. Yes, those are the characters and that's the setting/environment, but, it's done by people who both don't understand them very well and don't know much about the movie making.Since it's not _terrible_, just bad, if you're a huge Matrix fan, I guess it would make sense to see it. For others, especially if you are a non-huge Matrix fan, it's better if you don't, it's gonna make you think a lot less about the first three movies.",3
18,"The original Matrix is an absolute classic (9/10). The two sequels were good (6 or 7/10) but with pretty confusing storylines in parts.This film is truly dreadful. Surprisingly awful in fact.The trailor takes tiny snapshots of the film and make it look like a fantastic blockbuster, but in reality it is a nostalgia-heavy, poorly thought out and terribly acted 'remake' of sorts of the first film.The storyline and the number of pointless easter eggs/repeats of the first film make this a largely pointless addition to the original trilogy.Save your money or go and see Spiderman instead 🤣",2
19,"So what if you could remake the original Matrix film, but this time without the big reveal of what the Matrix is and add a twist that tries to explain why you could do that? It's like an idea you joke around about but not actually make into a film that you've made before. And in typical Hollywood fashion, they remake the same thing but just bigger, flashier, with things they think are even cooler, - and results in something so much dumber. Things in this Matrix don't need to make sense provided they look cool, which is all that matters.This Matrix should have stayed dead. Action? No, not really, at least not for a very large part of it - and the kung fu actually sucks. This is The Matrix: A Love Story. But this time, with just cooler looking characters and mumbo jumbo that explains the technology stuff in a way that doesn't make sense to us people but it does to the actors, who nod their heads and smile as if they really know what that techno gobbledygook means.""Wow, this code is freaky!!!!"" one actor says in excitement! LOL, the film becomes a parody of itself, along with replacement actors who can't help but try their best to mimic the iconic performances of a cast that happened to have been cast perfectly. My single word review of this tripe is the replacement phrase for ""whoa!!!"" that was in the original film. ""Fuuuuuuuu*****!"" See it if you're curious. But it's big, dumb and a useless grab at the franchise cash register.",1
20,"Matrix resurrection is nothing more than nonsensical garbage with a few rehashed scenes from the original trilogy thrown in for nostalgia.This movie lacks everything that made ""The Matrix"" original &amp; exciting &amp; is more snoozefest than blockbuster.A far better choice would've been to cast a new young lead to continue the story of humans vs the machines.More time spent on developing a decent story would've been far better than throwing copious amounts of money at cgi artists &amp; stuntmen.",1
21,"I've been waiting for this one with anticipation and I was thoroughly disappointed. I spent the first 40 minutes wondering what was going on. It was barely coherent. The rest of the movie got slightly better. But there was no real story. Some parts were enjoyable. Some weren't. But, at the end, I didn't feel like my day had been enriched by watching it and I have no desire to watch it again. The original Matrix, on the other hand, I still watch that at least once a year. This movie was done strictly as a money grab. There was no real story to tell and no journey to follow. I don't recommend it!",5
22,"I remember seeing the Matrix in the cinema as a young kid and it blew my mind. It was the essence of cool, combining a then unfamiliar Hong Kong aesthetic with cutting edge special effects, heady themes, and of course bringing bullet time to the forefront of modern cinema. Visually it was soo revolutionary that the 2003 sequels were never able to recapture that impact, and this sequel is no exception.Nowadays there isn't a single superhero movie that hasn't been built on the Matrix's special effects and evolved it to such a level that Resurrections would have truly have had to have been unique to have the same impact as the original, which is something that I doubt anyone was expecting, so all I was asking for was a solid, well thought out, storyline. And that sadly is something that Resurrection does not have. Hell, half of the movie seems to just be footage from the first three movies, one quarter is millennial characters moaning about millennial issues, and one quarter seems to be new, albeit pointless, content.I can see why Hugo, after reading the script, turned down the chance to reprise his Agent Smith role. I would have done the same if I'd have read the script too. And casting Neil Patrick Harris as a villain? He was so miscast that he was comically bad; I genuinely felt embarrassed for him and his performance. Keanu too, sadly, put it a terrible performance, arguable the worst of his career, and Carrie-Anne Moss was clearly just walking in her performance. Jessica Henwick seemed to be about the only one who could be bothered to act in this movie but sadly her storyline was just as dull as the rest of the movie.Morpheus once said that unfortunately no-one can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself. Well I'm telling you now that you do not need to see the movie to know that it's bad. Sometimes you should just leave sleeping dogs lie.",4
23,"This is so cheap that they basically remade the first film yet made it also a sequel at the same time. The majority of the film has the same structure as the first film and most scenes are exactly the same just altered...The good thing is that CGI is very high quality, but at the same time action scenes feel so generic and uninspired, way inferior to the original film, I admit a few moments were cool, but most action not only feel weak but poorly executed like fights feel like they were made by people who don't know how to fight so they just try to imitate what fighting supposed to look like from what they've seen somewhere else.Music is trying real hard to imitate the soundtrack of original films yet feels weaker and more like rip-offs than remixes or remakes of old tracks.What's up with all the references and literally showing footage from previous films? Do they think we have forgotten the films completely? But the insulting part is that film acknowledges that it references itself to the point that it literally tells that fact a few times - as a joke? I guess, sort of breaking the 4th wall but not really I guess. It's just so lame.There are also so many embarrassing scenes, I laughed so hard at some of the stuff that if this film isn't meme material - I don't know what is then.Also, many of the returning characters often feel completely out of character, and I despise how they treated most characters that do not return for this film. It feels like that Matrix parody by CollegeHumor.Most importantly this feels very long (and it is), yet it shows almost nothing cool, most of it just replicates the first film also making it somehow longer yet worse in every way with the only exception being a much better CGI. It's such a shame that such uninspired sequels like this exist.",2
24,"Utter rubbish. In the first few minutes I already knew that this movie would disrespect and soil the Matrix legacy (and frankly, the last one really toed the line).Garbage plot, garbage directing, no Morpheus, garbage effects. Felt cheaply done. What were they thinking? This movie has no business bearing the ""The Matrix'"" moniker. The ending alone should have made someone stop and ask ""is this dumb af or is it just me?""Bottom line? We deserved better than this.Keanu, if you read this I hope you know that I'm still a huge fan. Your acting was terrible but I forgive you.",2
25,"While this movie has some interesting additions, which I assume came from fans who complained about the original trilogy. I see conflict and hypocrisy with the script. I see continuity problems. I see goofs.I also see they did not capture lightning in a bottle again. The movie, while having some cinematic scenes, is meh. I started watching it the morning it was released, but then stopped because I was bored. I then watched it for a bit in the afternoon and then quit. I barely could get 2/3rds of the way through on the first day and then I quit again. It didn't grab me. I didn't care enough to binge watch it.The first movie was like that, I wanted to know more, I wanted to see what would happen to Neo. It had me by the balls. I was interested. This movie is completely opposite. I don't care and I don't think I ever will. I won't buy the movie. I won't by the poster. I will forget it.Is it worth watching? Sure, one viewing is suitable. I like Reeves. I like him and many of the other actors, but I find the writing and directing empty and an attempt at resolving the mistakes in the first three movies.Nice CG, nice tricks, nice action, but that's all it appears to possess.",1
26,"Writers have ran out of material, and the new writers are just plain rubbish. They have to re release old movies or make another installment. No originality anymore. Most new stuff's boring. Im finding myself having to watch old 70s 80s 90s movies. The stuff we get today is BAD lol.Nothing to see here. Not tht i was expecting anything.",3
27,"Aside from the action scenes and a few throwback moments, this film is a misfire on many levels. It just doesn't have the feel of a Matrix film at all. Just some cool visual effects, decent action and a bit of uniqueness is what this unnecessary sequel is watchable for one time.It's not boring but also doesn't justify the length. The sad part is, the non-action or the dialogue parts don't have any excitement or energy at all. Watching them is almost a chore, while the action set-pieces hold your attention with the style and presentation. The actors did good, and that's something I can't deny.All in all, this feels more like a direct-to-video sequel made to cash in on the original franchise. Resurrections isn't really bad: it's watchable, but has its limitations. Keep your expectations in check before you watch this and you might find a good time-pass action flick for the evening. That's all there is to it. The Matrix should have stayed a trilogy, but a new film is welcome for a singular viewing experience nonetheless.",6
28,"It's pointless and poorly written to the point of senselessness.The whole movie felt unnecessary and basically exists for woke points and ""ratconnation""",3
29,"Basically the first 50 minutes was so boring I almost quit watching, but I stuck with it. There were so many flashback scenes from the original trilogy for no reason at all, except to take up time. I also really hated that they brought in new characters to replace Morpheus and others character we loved. It didn't work at all.At around the 50 minute mark we get an action scene, but then it went back to boring as hell until the last 15 minutes or so.The last bit of the movie had some good action action scenes but nothing amazing. He stops a lot of bullets with his hands.I was so disappointed in this movie. It was just so damn boring. If they would have got rid of all the flashbacks and brought back the original characters (they didn't have to make it 60 years later) and had a better script with more action, it could have been great. How did anyone think this crap is what everyone wanted to see?",3
30,"I praise Lana Wachowski for trying something different. It would have been very easy to just bring ""more of the same"". That's the kind of sequels we are used to in Hollywood and most of the public seems perfectly happy with that. This a Matrix love story. This is incredibly meta (believe me, see that first act!). The issue is that...it doesn't work that well.The love story between Neo and Trinity is the main plot and some scenes between them are ok, but nothing transcendental. Mostly cheesy, to be honest. Surprisingly, the characters I like the most are two new ones: Bugs (Jessica Henwick) and The Analyst (Neil Patrick Harris). Both of the actors did a great job and made me preferred a story more about them than the story we had. The first act of the film is ultra self-aware, the action is very Marvel style (you can't see anything), visuals are as good as ever, there is a stupid amount of flashbacks and it feels very small compared with the og trilogy. There are no big things at stake, so you never have a feeling of urgency. There are a lot of references to non-binary things, to freedom, to comfort, to love, even to ""being too late to wake up"". But it doesn't fee that fresh compared to what we had seen before.It hurts that someone tried something so different and it failed. I was even tempted to say the film has as many good things as bad things. The problem is that the good things are never memorable. Maybe a 2nd watch will help this one.",4
31,"You don't fix what isn't broken, we were all ok with the trilogy and forgot about it, you don't need to resurrect it by making a 4th movie. This movie felt like a cartoon, plot was childish and forced, performances weren't all great and 40% of the movie are references from the trilogy. Fighting sequences felt weird and archaic basically cuz they tried introducing new elements that rather ruined it combined with unnecessary slow-mo shots.....it had its few fun moments and that's all, this movie brought me no joy and will hardly recommend it.",3
32,"The only credit I will give this movie is that at least it doesn't do to Neo what Disney did to Luke in the Star Wars sequels. Other than that, the film is a dud. The costumes are weak. The sets are bad. The fights are boring. The new Agent Smith and Neil Patrick Harris are forgettable. It's not as bad as X-Men Three: The Last Stand, or Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, or the Star Wars prequels or sequels, but it's forgettable.",3
33,"Truly unbelievable they had the nerve to release this. They re-enact the majority of scenes from the trilogy, primarily the original movie, and also physically show footage of the original numerous times. Pathetic, it really is pathetic. I'm tired of this repetitive mediocre garbage with seemingly every new movie of the past 5 or so years, the lack of effort and quality is beyond sad. I barely go to the cinema anymore as of a few years ago due to total nonsense being on, and I think this was my last cinema visit ever unless I can be sure it's even remotely worth the money.",1
34,What the frick did we just watch I actually wanted to turn it off after 20 minutes but figured it's free on HBO so might as well finish it. Even at free it was BAD it wasnt even a bad b title. Reeves just breezed through it showed no emotion no decent fight scenes nothing improved over the 22 year wait. His John Wick movies are all awesome you always get phenomenal action phenomenal fights and a decent story. This was bad in every possible way. Oh and it just shows YOU NEEDED HUGO WEAVING!!! He didn't get enough credit for the matrix movies. And Neil Patrick Harris as a Villian...IN A MATRIX FILM.. WHAT??? Wow what a complete let down this train wreck was... shame on you reeves!! Now I'm worried about John Wick 4!!!,1
35,"First &amp; foremost they should have left this trilogy well alone! As it progressively got worst from the original to revelations. But ultimately was a good trilogy and a great original.Now what the ???? Is this mess!? That basiclly throws half of the old film in &amp; copies the other half with much, much poorer actors as is the nature of this very unoriginal and unimpressive shambles. Acting was badddd, Script was beyond a joke made by an A' hole &amp; Considering it's predecessor.. it's pathetic.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless I hated them.",1
36,"I realize that writing another Matrix movie would be incredibly hard, but it's supposed to be hard to add another movie when the last movie wraps everything up.Well, the first part is a lot of rehashing the first movie and flashbacks, then more flashbacks. The CGI is pretty good but that's about it. Then some fighting and kung fu, but remember Keanu is 20 years older so it's all cut scenes.Most of all the other actors act like they are in a fan movie. There are tons of parodies of the earlier movies which doesn't really add anything.Agent Smith is a new actor and the inevitable fight between them is nearly identical to previous ones with the same moves. It even stops mid fight for Smith to say ""Nice one"" after getting hit and Neo to reply, ""Thanks."". Seriously GTFO.The Neo and Trinity reunion has copy pasted the dialogue from previous movies.Neil Patrick Harris is just terrible. He has a 10 minute soliloquy in bullet time that is just super annoying.To wrap up they have New and Trinity get back together in the midst of endless gun shooting. And then Trinity becomes the one. Ugh.",2
37,"A good number of professional movie critics are not fully honest, fearful of burning bridges with those in the industry. But this time, a larger number have even had a hard time stomaching their disgust for this lazy, bloated, boring tribute to itself.In a nutshell, this is what happens when a concept should have ended earlier, becomes a trilogy that should have nailes the coffin shut, and they decide they still want to cash in on an easy reboot of the same intellectual property they own. It's so convoluted that it must be explained to the viewer, in great detail, as if a board room pitch with the questions: So sis it all make sense? What do you think?The answers are ""no"" and ""sets a new low on useless sequels that at least could have been 100 minutes to minimize the waste of time."" It's hard to go back to the original with a straight face after having seen this.",1
38,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""The Matrix Resurrections is one of my biggest disappointments of the year. Lana Wachowski delivers a surprisingly meta, self-aware movie about the original trilogy packed with bold, fascinating ideas but an absolutely terrible execution.From the dreadfully unfunny, cringe-worthy brainstorming sessions about the previous films to the heavy-handed, headache-inducing exposition, the director constantly tries to tell the viewers how incredible the original trilogy is, forgetting to create a compelling, captivating story for this new installment.The gorgeous visuals and impactful score aren't good enough to elevate the shockingly average, choppy action sequences. Despite remarkable performances from Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, and the standout Jessica Henwick, Resurrections just didn't work for me.If you're a fan of the franchise, I obviously recommend watching it. Just be aware that this isn't a new The Matrix movie, but instead a film about the actual saga.""Rating: C-",4
39,"A lot of effort went into the story, with details and references and self references and in-jokes. And yet, in the last act of the film, it felt like who ever wrote the thing ran out of ideas and just did random things. That felt like a betrayal. Then there was the film itself, which consistently felt less evolved, in both effects and fight choreography, than the original film *from 22 years ago!*. Last but not least, there were the characters. Keanu and Carrie-Ann aside, the rest of the people had no characterization at all and the actors, some I knew from other stuff like Sense8, had less to work with than in the TV series they were grabbed from. Remember how awesome Max Riemelt was in Sense 8? Here he was a yes man with a bad accent. Remember how amazing and fun Lambert Wilson was in the original Matrix films? Here he was no more than an obscenity spouting homeless crazy person. I think Jonathan Groff did a reasonable job, but his character was all over the place. And so on.I don't want to touch on the sexual orientation of most of the actors or the agenda that is always pushed by the Wackowskis, because it doesn't really matter here. Put all that aside and it's still a mess of a film.Bottom line: if it were a random low budget scifi, it would have been average. As a sequel to The Matrix, it has great potential and it failed miserably.",6
40,Everything in this movie is cheap and poor. I thought I was watching a TV movie. Action scenes were horrible and Keanu looked like he was sleeping. It was so distracting that everyone looked so different - Keanu looks like John Wick.,1
41,"They made Jupiter Ascending and it was one if not the worst scifi universes I've ever seen created, people ignored it acting like they've never made any bad movie choices or productions outside of the matrix or even inside it.I'm not a diehard fan of the matrix but enjoyed 2 out of 3 of the films and its clear this was gonna be a cash grab by them. So congrats if you paid for this in the theatres. I saw it through HBO early and this is garbo.",1
42,"Surely They could of done better than this?The movie is incoherent, sure you could probably understand it after 3 or 4 more viewings, but this movie isn't good enough for that many viewings.I'm sorry, but they missed the mark big time, you can't follow what is going on in the movie, therefore you don't care about the damn movie.There are some good action scenes though and a funny joke with neo near the end.But this is a dud. 👎",4
43,"To be honest, my expectations weren't high. Revivals after two decades almost never fair well. This film spends a lot of time displaying flashbacks of the original trilogy scenes to earn brownie points with OG fans, but this new installment doesn't bring anything new to the table as far as science fiction is concern. It just reiterates the original story with an added gaming/programmer side story of which there are countless on Netflix. They even rehash some of the original special effects again into this film.This installment turns into a romance between Neo and Trinity where Neo tries to recapture a lost love. Probably the only good thing about the film was some of the martial arts fighting between Neo and Morpheus. But that's not enough to make this film worth rewatching.The film is a letdown. And producers, let Keanu Reeves get some much-needed sleep. He looked like he was half asleep in all of his scenes.",3
44,"A lot of dialogue, less action. When it's characters talking, their words are boring and unmemorable. When it's action, the action is boring and a chore to watch. This new Matrix manages to be the worst one so far. If you are not planning on seeing this movie, keep doing whatever it is you're doing.",2
45,"It's funny how they say the world is progressing and social media is anything but the worst creation of all time. We have so many traditions that are being killed off. Only have to look at Xmas number one, yeah charity stuff is great but there's 364 other days where these people do very little, selfishness is ignored to blindly praise the undeserving.All the activism and preaching from behind a screen, seeing the absolute wrong people as role models and everything is suffering from people skills to ignoring the harder off to fight for shallow causes and still being seen as victims!Entertainment is a joke now from the PC army creating female versions of films that have been an embarrassment, even though women are equally talented they're being treated like victims, it's insane how blinded people are thinking things are getting better.This barely qualifies as a film, a nostalgia recap masquerading as a weak generations wet dream, utter embarrassment. Just yet another awful film like west side story that proves imagination is dead and quality is sacrificed for butt kissing the people who are making this world a vain superficial entitled narcissistic dump.",1
46,"Sometimes you just should leave something in the past. And so it was with the 2021 movie ""The Matrix Resurrections"" from director Lana Wachowski. Of course, with the popularity of the original trilogy, then I can understand why they wanted to cash in on this franchise. But come on...Personally, I think the movies have been gradually sliding downhill ever since part one, with each movie becoming more and more of a farce. And this 2021 movie simply tops the cake with cheese factor. I wasn't the least bit entertained by Lana Wachowski's ""The Matrix Resurrections"", and I was struggling to stay awake throughout the course of it, and the storyline just failed to entertain me. In fact, I walked out on the movie halfway through. And believe you me, this is not a movie that I will be returning to finish watching.Sure, it was interesting enough to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss return to the movie, but after 18 years it was just no longer relevant. And with the absence of both Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving then ""The Matrix Resurrections"" just stood on impossibly weakened ground. And I can't say that having Yahya Abdul-Mateen II or Neil Patrick Harris in the movie was bringing much thrill to me.Visually then ""The Matrix Resurrections"" was quite impressive. Of course it was, just like the original trilogy, then the CGI in the movie was off the charts. But you know, CGI effects can only do so much for a movie without a proper script and storyline.I found ""The Matrix Resurrections"" to be the worst of all four movies in the franchise thus far. But then again, I wasn't thrilled when they announced this movie was in the works, nor was it something I had been anxiously waiting to get to watch.My rating of ""The Matrix Resurrections"" lands on a three out of ten stars.",3
47,"Disappointing, convoluted, messy, and just poor is all I have to say for this film.Let's start with pros, good cinematography, and good CGI. Passable acting, with honestly Neil Patrick Harris's character surprisingly being my favorite. I like Keanu Reeves, and Carrie Anne Moss but without out a doubt whatever revenue this film makes opening week/weekend is because of these two actors alone, and of course holiday spending.I didn't care for any of the new characters, and worst of all Neo is not Neo, and Trinity is not Trinity. Falling victim of course to Hollywood's typical feminine agenda. This entire film relies heavily on reliving past glories in ways of quotes, and recreating certain scenes from the original film. Plot holes, and explanations that are soo rushed if you blink you miss just to get to the next action scene as to make sure they are keeping audience members attention.The action was poor as well, soo much happening but with nothing going on. Perhaps this is why for the most part they dropped a lot of the classic Matrix slomotion moments, because if it was there you'd be able to see how full of nothing the action scenes were.This is just a poor sequel or attempt at rebooting the franchise, Keanu Reeves, Carrie Anne Moss, and the legacy of the Matrix deserve better. Save your money wait to rent, and instead go watch Spider-Man No Way Home.3/10.",3
48,"Actually you can also pretend 2 &amp; 3 didn't happen. And so you've been warned...Many years have passed since the Millennium where we were dazzled by the birth of tech cool Neo. We all marveled at the idea that we are living in a pre-fab world. Over 2 decades later, Trinity is a wide hipped soccer Mom and Neo is a game program dealing with suicidal thoughts. Is this what becomes of us Gen-X'ers?The better idea would have been to follow Trinity through the revival. Because her story was much more tragic and therefore, a better arc. Perhaps they were afraid of the backlash of anti-woke brigade. Here's a hint, if the movie is good...no one cares. But this was a dull sad empty shell of what was great. Perhaps the transition from Larry to Lana also required a lobotomy.",2
49,"The Matrix Resurrections does an adequate job of explaining HOW it exists as a sequel to the trilogy, yet it doesn't really justify WHY it exists. It's good to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss back in their respective roles, although the rest of the cast (and some of the action scenes) are fairly forgettable. This sequel also has the same pretentious tone the other sequels have. None of them are as great as our first trip into The Matrix.",5
50,"The Matrix Resurrections (2021)Red Pill? Yes please. Blue pill? Sure, give me that too. As a matter of fact, I was ready to take an inordinate amount of pills in order to endure this film. The idea of reviving Matrix after 18 years sounded like a bad cash grab from the start but seeing Keanu, gave me a microscopic amount of optimism. Sadly, in about 30 minutes, that optimism was crushed under the heavy weight of excessive nonsense masquerading as a movie. Before watching, I wondered why Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne didn't come back but I quickly understood that they didn't want to shame themselves with this abomination.Matrix 4 tries to put a new spin on the story by having Keanu act as a person who created a series of games which depict the Matrix trilogy and now he is trapped in this illusion which is ultimately the new Matrix. Sounds confusing yeah? Well, the whole movie is one endless ride of confusion that endlessly leaches off the original trilogy but instead of creating nostalgia, it induces boredom. There is no clever idea, interesting dialogue or a palpable sense of struggle that made the first Matrix into an iconic film. It's hard to believe how in the 21st century where tech is everywhere and people are constantly online, they couldn't come up with a thought provoking story.The extremely weak plot, makes it hard to care for the characters and whatever they are going though. Whether we take the new fashion designer Morpheus, the pretentious parody of Agent Smith, or Keanu himself, nothing actually feels like a Matrix film. You might think that they at least nailed the CGI action scenes but somehow they are worse than they were 18 years ago. None of the fights cary any weight and they simply feel like flushing a toilet and throwing some toy soldiers in there to swirl and make noises.It's not often that I sit in the cinema and actually wait for the film to end. This time, I have spent the last hour trying to endure this insult to the legacy of one of the best movies of all time. Maybe the film had some positives in it but my head was hurting too much to notice any of them.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.",3
51,"This movie didn't need to be made, and it doesn't live up to any of the first three in the trilogy. It's like everyone phoned it in - the actors, the writers, the directors. Sad.Some of the main characters from the original got short-shrifted and that, to me, was the biggest disappointment and unforgivable.Unoriginal, unexciting, and unfathomable why someone thought this was a good idea. Three stars only because Keanu is in it.",3
52,"It's been 18 years since the final edition of Matrix was released. Neo 57 and Trinity 54 don't have the same charm that audience came to love nearly 2 decades ago. In fact Neo and Trinity look haggard and tired. In addition, all the old crew is gone and getting used to a new one is too tiresome. Besides nothing new in the plot to watch, to pique the audience interest. All I got to say is.......... Meh 😒",4
53,"I've had it with these pointless soft reboots. It's like Terminator Genisys crossed with A Good Day to Die Hard (in terms of sequel style), except way, way worse. It thoroughly destroys the entire Matrix legacy, so efficiently in fact that it seems like a parody that is trying to do exactly that. It has no soul, no point, no logic, nothing. I even hated every single action sequence. It was so repulsive I had to look at memes on half a screen to lessen the pain enough to finish the film. Turns out there wasn't a single enjoyable second there to find, yet I still feel brave for having watched it all the way, making it the single worst movie I've ever finished. Easily the greatest disappointment in film history. Therefore this movie is an inspiration for fan made Matrix short films and reloaded/revolutions edits. Only watch this film if you're being paid good money to do so.",
54,"The most important success of the movie is that people who watch it feel the need to watch the first The Matrix movie and Animatrix series.Oh, and Jefferson Airplay on the agenda again.Other than that, I will never understand why people I trust give this movie 2 stars (4 on imdb) or higher.I battled on E-Bay for the Animatrix and The Matrix 4K collection, but I won't be buying this movie as physical media. I probably won't buy it until it's the discounted movie of the week on Itunes.",3
55,"This movie made no sense (the premise was ridiculous) - Trinity was dead. No robot was going to change that. Neo was completely disfigured... why do robots care about his appearance, why reconstruct his face? It's not going to make him a better battery. Let's not even go into how everyone aged incredibly with the exception of Neo and Trinity. This was not really necessary as a plot device. They could have said 10-15 years went by instead of 60.",1
56,"I wish i hadnt seen it and The Matrix had, for me, remained a trilogy.Thats really all one needs to say about it.If pushed i would say most of the film is spent flailing around trying to explain its reason for being...the movie itself seems to wonder why it even exists, and i certainly cant explain it...Love Keanu. But he should have left this alone.1 star, because Keanu is a top bloke...",1
57,Cash grab sequel.Poor direction and script.Set itself for more sequels.Edting and sound scape so so.Extended use of 1st movie clips redundant. Acting/directing uninspired. Stick with the original 1st one.Not recommended.============================================,5
58,"""Not needed"" comes to mind. Sure the original trilogy didn't end well but like so many other 20 year later sequels and reboots no one asked for it.And like so many others it just cheapened the original.Replacements no one asked for either. Fishburn was iconic and replacing him, replacing Smith, they just left a bad taste in your mouth. The twist on Fishburns character was also unwanted and deeply insulting to fans.But that is always what happens when you do these things.So why did I change it from 1 star to 10?Because i watched it again, and the first time I watched it I was literally bias. Why are they making another Matrix movie? We don't need another one, the first Matrix was perfect, and, though the other two were flawed, it ended.The story ended... so why ten stars?Because that is EXACTLY what Lana was saying when she made this.Remember the scene in the 2nd film where all the different Neo's are giving the finger? The finger returns, but on a second viewing that is exactly what this movie is.This movie is Lana giving the middle finger to a studio that was going to move on a reboot without them, and I feel like an idiot, because it really wasn't even that disguised.So... KUDOS LANA, that is hysterical, that is hands down the best way to deal with the studio executives that are forcing your IP into another horrible reboot.",10
59,"The Matrix franchise is over. I really can't wrap my head around this film. Lazy writing, OK special effects, and weak characters. My wife fell asleep halfway through and I found myself constantly yawning. This is a movie that should've been made 10 years ago. The new young ""Morpheus"" is a joke. I would've preferred a CGi version of Mr. Fishburne instead. Either you're going to love or hate the new Matrix. I choose the latter for various reasons. Heck I think it would've made a better video game than movie. Now I highly suggest you lower your expectations before watching it because you will be disappointed if you're looking for a 10/10 Matrix film....highly disappointed...you can tell it was made during the pandemic.",1
60,"Just awful. Terrible acting from most, insipid story, woefully bad script, just silly and bad. The third movie tried too hard and was subsequently bad in many places, this is just bad throughout. The characters shout at nearly every weird moment, like a TV episode so you understand the moment. There is no redemption from this other than it looks great in places.",1
61,"No.I mean, why put effort into something that is so likely to fail? Maybe we should take the phrase from the film ""if we don't do this, Warner Bros. Will do the sequel without us"" literally.This movie is a lot of things:1) It's a parody. The casting, the self-irony, the overabundance of references, and footage from the trilogy (I'm sure Matrix fans would've spotted them even without constant cut-ins). The new 'Morpheus from the hood' felt like they wanted me to feel pain while he was on screen. There was a Smith replacement that was a self-ironized deus ex machina, but I cannot connect him with Weaving's performance. My brain in my version of Matrix is incapable of making that connection. I have nothing against the actor who played the new one, but it cannot be done. The Merovingian scene was probably a lot of fun for someone, but I felt like the creators were trying to rub dirt all over my face.2) It's an effort on undoing the trilogy's conclusion. Proving that nothing you do matters and nothing is real, besides love, I guess? You could feel the stakes in the trilogy, but here the ending really achieves nothing, aside from cat videos jokes of course in the post-cred. So if the concept of loops is to be taken seriously, these sequels can and will continue. A rather strange way was chosen to devalue one's own creation and make the people who like it feel robbed.3) It's a needlessly convoluted empty shell of a story. Important story elements are delivered through throwaway lines (I appreciate Jessica Henwick's acting, but the mumble lines were inaudible). A conflict between the machines? The machines seem to have no motivation or self-perseverance interest in this film, they do nothing. The story of the human-machine city almost sparked an interest, but then it was immediately abandoned, I say human-machine, but there were no humans spotted in the city besides the pirate elder Niobe in a questionable make-up. Humans are not concerned with survival anymore, they are not fighting ""control"", which was an important element in the trilogy. But they still find and bring Neo to the real world for exactly what? Even the city elder doesn't care he's there, so they let him go but then capture him again exactly why? The Analyst says that the Matrix works best when Neo and Trin are close but not together. But the whole explanation on why resurrect them in the first place when everybody forgot about them is ""I became very effective"". If the story gave me a coherent explanation on why Bugs wants to bring back Neo so much, maybe I would've understood exactly what was the point of anything that was going on in the film. What I am trying to say is that none of the characters had a reason for anything to change besides Bugs, but she stops being a character very fast. She should've been way more significant than she is portrayed. Maybe if Sati was removed this would've saved some time.4) It's an average superhero action film. Most of the action scenes involved a lot of people and edits, making them hard to follow and overall unengaging. The side characters are paper-thin, so there are no reasons to care for them. This kills any attempt to empathize with them, as we roughly understand that our duo is unlikely to get hurt in The Matrix. There is no interesting gunplay, no dynamics in hand-to-hand combat, no styles, no impact is felt. And they actually had Chad Stahelski as Chad, I know right. I wonder would he would say about these action setpieces.5) It's a whole new look. Obviously, everyone can't look and act like we're still on the cusp of the 2000s. The Matrix has been restarted and its modern version looks different. The only problem is that the new look of the movie lacks an identity. It doesn't look like anything distinctive that can be easily recognized. The same goes for the music, which, unfortunately, is absolutely forgettable.To summarize, I liked three things: the very idea of the pointlessness of what's going on (which went in the wrong direction at the end), the scenes of Neo reflecting with Niobe the pirate, and the idea of coexisting with the machines. Well, the CGI was ok as well, no problems there.Otherwise, it was pretty mediocre and pointless until the ending, which made my eyes roll into my skull with the speed of light.As for a recommendation, trilogy fans will watch it anyway, you can't really miss it. I do not recommend this film to people who are not familiar with the trilogy, because without watching all the installments they will understand exactly nothing.",5
62,"I had great expectation for this movie and was especially glad I could watch from home on HBOMAX. I also was excited about its 2.5 run time expecting a lot of time in the world of the ""Matrix"" too. Then, the movie started and me and my guests were at full focus watching, listening minute after minute expecting greatness and then the bomb as in DUD was revealed &amp; dropped right on the viewer! The first half hour was useless and meaningless and a waste of time. Then, the actors were corny, the fight scenes weak and redundant and the Director (was there one?) needs to take dot-connecting 101 if planning to make a career in movies. Yes, the movie will make money but also at the same time join all the other dud sequels like Rocky, Terminator &amp; sorry to say Star Wars too! Shame on everyone involved in this fiasco. Why is it that when successful people make a lot of money that they lose their creativity, drive, uniqueness and sense of wonder about their journey and its accomplishments? As for NEO, a weak, goofy and disappointing individual with no depth and you find it hard to link up to where the trio of movies left off? Trinity as well and all the other characters have little, or no background let alone point or purpose. Star Trek took us where no man has been before, Star Wars gave us Yoda and Obi wan, Jurassic Park dinosaurs, Rambo with his awesome fight-back skills, Terminator with its relentless machine mission, Alien mysterious lifeform, and all of them including this Matrix have poisoned our parting memories of some superior earlier work &amp; concept. Hollywood, once again is in it for the money (viewer money) and while they should run it like a business, they should also not insult the viewing audience either. Shame and shame again on all involved.",3
63,"The fourth chapter in the groundbreaking franchise that redefined a genre finds its visionary creator returning to the fold and add a new spin to the enduring legacy of The Matrix Trilogy. The Matrix Resurrections serves not only as a sequel, reboot &amp; remake but also as a critique of it all, taking a dig on its parent studio &amp; overly obsessed fans with its self-referential quips while offering a story that's destined to polarise its audience.Produced, co-written &amp; directed by Lana Wachowski (Bound &amp; Cloud Atlas), the approach &amp; aesthetics for this latest entry are way different from the original trilogy as it attempts to chart a new course while functioning as a continuation of the same saga. The first half of the film is meta-galore and there is a lot of cringe &amp; exposition to steer through in order to meet it on its wavelength but even after all the familiar beats, it evokes a different feeling.Unlike its predecessors which operate as action sci-fi, this one mainly falls under the domain of romance sci-fi with more emphasis on love &amp; its ability to transcend the boundaries of real &amp; digital world, which in turn offers Keanu Reeves &amp; Carrie-Anne Moss new emotional depths to explore as Neo &amp; Trinity and the actors more than deliver on that, their moments brimming with palpable tension &amp; intimacy. The other characters however are more or less forgettable.Overall, The Matrix Resurrections is no match to the originality &amp; perfection of the first film or pure unabashed spectacle of the sequels that followed but it still retains the rich mythology &amp; endless curiosities of the saga and definitely belongs to this world. While it is our affection for the central characters that does the heavy lifting here, the interest in the story never for once fizzles out, thus making it an intriguing addition to the series despite being the weakest of the four films. Don't miss it.",

66,"This movie was completely unnecessary. Besides Keanu and Ross the acting was horrible. It felt like a B-movie Matrix rip off with a couple originals making cameos. I still have absolutely no idea why Morpheus and Smith were different people, and I have no idea what was going on for the entire second half of the movie, or what the purpose of the climax was. The dialogue and the way the actors carried themselves was absolutely nothing like the original movies. I just don't understand what the purpose of this movie was.",1

71,"The plot was too contrived yet also too convoluted. How is that even possible? It's too bad the filmmaker(s) had to go back to the well again, when it was all sealed up nicely 17 years ago. The casting was also mediocre, to say the least, in terms of the new characters and the ""replaced"" characters, too. This is a film that never should have been made, period. Read the synopsis/summary online, and then watch it when it comes to HBO Max (or whatever streaming service) eventually ... if you can stomach its ridiculousness. Oh, and Groff? Terrible actor for this role/film. He's always been too smarmy, and this was just too much to take for more than 5 minutes of screen time. Even Keanu's beard/burns were nauseating.",1
72,"Considering many walked away disappointed from the supposed final Matrix instalment in 2003 with the divisive Revolutions, reentering the Matrix once more seemingly wasn't the worst idea, especially with original leads Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss back alongside one half of the directing team Lana Wachowski, but upon sitting through the arduous/talk heavy trite that is Resurrections, perhaps everyone should've let sleeping dogs lie when it came to this once bright property.Starting out in such a bright fashion with 1999's ground breaking original, The Matrix series has suffered across its further three film run from diminishing returns but even the CGI fest Revolutions seems like a cinematic masterpiece when compared to this wannabe meta offering that spends 50 minutes warming the engine up in a sleep inducing and confusing way before giving way to an unexciting and bland sci-fi action spectacle that fails to provide a single decent set piece around a plot line that makes one wonder how the Wachowski's were responsible for writing the brilliant original.Losing their mojo since The Matrix was first at the peak of its powers with the likes of TV failure Sense8, flop adaptation Speed Racer and the diabolical Jupiter Ascending, with only their work on Cloud Atlas reminding us all that they do in fact harbor much talent as filmmakers, the Wachowski's have always been trying to reach the heights of their first sci-fi experience with that same try-hard nature infiltrating almost every scene and plot element of Resurrections as it tries desperately to fool us into thinking it should exist and that it's smarter than your average Hollywood blockbuster.If there was going to be a savior of this bland and tiresome affair, focused around Neo's awakening once more in a video game inspired world and place in time where Warner Brother's are demanding more from the Matrix brand, it was the appearance of Reeves and Moss bringing their iconic characters to life once more but the two well-liked performers are unable to do much with the forced love story at the heart of the tale here while newcomers such as poor Jonathan Groff as a new iteration of Agent Smith (playing literally no point in the films story), the overdone Neil Patrick Harris as new villain The Analyst and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as a younger version of Morpheus all fail to bring anything fun or thrilling to this new Matrix tale.Without anyone bringing the fun in front of the camera, with a convoluted and uninspired script and a lack of anything noteworthy in the spectacle stakes, Resurrections is a dead on arrival affair that should've stayed dormant with it doing nothing but sullying the name cinemagoers and genre fans once were proud to love.Final Say -The proposition of returning to The Matrix once more wasn't the worst of ideas but sadly The Matrix Resurrections is a bland, pointless and misguided outing that should bring about the death knell of this once bright property once and for all.1 ranting Frenchman out of 5For more review check out Jordan and Eddie.",2

Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stood out as absolute trash (I am being generous) with the worst writing and Neil Patrick Harris who is a fantastic actor with equal bad writing.The choreography is exactly what you would expect from a cash-grab. Remember how the actors had to learn Kung-Fu in the original? That's why it looked awesome. This shoddy product replaces it with quick cuts and fake punches.One of the worst nostalgia-cashgrabs ever, since the ""makers"" did not watch the original trilogy and the absurd amount of footage they used from the trilogy.The comedy or consistent parody towards the trilogy physically hurt and is never funny.Remember that the Neo we knew was the only ""chosen one"" who fell in love? He was also the 6th I think? Oh yea, Trinity died! And no way you can save her after the way she died!The love story was not the significant aspect of the trilogy. It was important, because it influenced Neos decision that lead to stop/halt of the cycle. But It was still Morpheus who enabled the story, while Agent Smith unknowingly gave Neo something to negotiate for the treaty. This ""love"" angle makes no sense. Making trinity to the ""One"" makes less sense. So they basically retcon the entire trilogy.It would be great to explore the cycle of Zion being destroyed and rebuild, the role of the chosen and the consistent upgrades to the Matrix, but no. We got this. The existence of this product is just punishment for a Matrix fan.",1
75,"The attempt to absolutely milk anything out of the original trilogy.Original Matrix was nothing special when it comes to acting performances but there was at least a some thought behind everything. This Matrix is nothing but a parody on the original ""bad acting"" making it comical in a horribly boring way.The casting of Neil Patrick Harris into semi-serious role ... holy moly it's bad. The rest of the crew of side characters ... lets just say I've seen better acted and written youtube projects.Other than ""Hi, look at me, I am from the movie 20 years ago"" this has nothing to offer. I expect the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movie to gain couple points. This is much worst than Godfather 3 level of bad.",2

77,"Even among sci-fi movies, The Matrix trilogy holds a hallowed position. Watching the trilogy, you get a grand unifying sense of deeper truth and philosophy similar to what binge watching Lord of the rings or Harry Potter movies brings.This absolute failure of an attempt at a money-grab however, is on the same sci-fi level as 'Alien Vs. Predator' or 'Universal Solider' and watching it feels as such and definitely doesn't feel like a continuation of the previous three movies, despite it force-feeding us scenes from the previous movies every few minutes.Just to be clear, the second and third movies in the trilogy get a bad rap for little reason, they had a lot of philosophical undertones without being too on the nose, and were visually attractive as well.This 4th movie is so so poorly conceived and even more badly executed that you have to wonder how the same director wrote the previous trilogy.Too on the nose, too trying to be meta without succeeding, too low budget.It just seems that the audience's sensibilities have far far exceeded the director's pathetic attempts at ""ideas"" which don't succeed at all.The new Morpheus, Smith and Merovingian characters are jokes forcibly written into this movie without any rhyme or reason at all. They have ~ 2-3 minutes of screen time at most without any consequence. I can see doing that to Merovingian but Smith and Morpheus?The jokes don't land, there's no character development, the action scenes are surprisingly bland and have no effect and almost every few scenes there's a flashback from one of the previous movies which gets super duper irritating very quickly.All in all, a gigantic failure and a frustrating experience.",1
78,"I'm beginning to think that the Wachowskis had a single great idea (The Matrix), an extra good movie after that (V for Vendetta), and the desire for some of the greatest eye candy ever (Speed Racer). Because everything else they have done is simply terrible.The first 30 minutes are terrible. They are full of exposition, rehashes of the old movies and boring stuff. But the rest of the movie is worse.I never understood why there was a new Matrix, or who created it. Or why. Nor I cared about it. Keanu Reeves spent the entire movie with his ""whoa"" face. And at the end I had it, too. But a bad ""whoa"".Avoid at all costs.",3
79,"Right from the get go the audience is informed that what they are about to witness is a cash grab by Warner Bros that the director was coerced into making. Not a great start. The message is clear, the film makers and Hollywood in general are worthless old hacks with nothing new to say but you, the viewer are lapping up this rehashed garbage because you conditioned to consume product. They even make the point explicitly clear by inserting flash cuts of the original movie just to rub in the fact they are not giving you anything new.So who is worse, the washed up hacks for producing this drivel or the gormless sheep who consume it without complaint? Well, very many are complaining and the movie is going to bomb at the box office. It's also the most pirated movie of the year, which is nice to know. It seems people actually don't like being insulted, even if they may not understand the insult they can sense this isn't right. So we'll done all concerned. Your condescension and high handed arrogance is going to cost you $100 million or more. The joke is on you.",1

85,"The story retcons the entire trilogy whilst stealing scenes from the first film and mashing it with an agonising and tedious 'story'. This is a disaster and I have no idea how this was green lit.The two Matrix sequels were a mess, but at least had the original characters and some new and weird characters to latch onto for the run time. In the end they were seen as failures in the continuation of the original but some of the action made up for it.In this movie we have a rehash and redressing of some characters with some incredibly dull dialogue. The take away is this movie was a messy and rushed cash grab with absolutely no redeeming qualities apart from a few scenes here and there.2/10 I hated everything about this movie and these people who made it should be ashamed of themselves. I'm sure they will follow the modern tone deaf trend for their box office failures and blame everyone under the sun other than pointing the finger at themselves.",2

Lots of nostalgia, lazy script, boring story. Its just milking.Some parts of the story was kind of interesting. But most of it was too boring.Nostalgia bait scenes were meh. Same with the meta stuff. I don't know how adding meta stuff makes the movie any entertaining. Action scenes too were just meh.

It's up to you to stop it.",1
94,"Let's see how many ways can you say BORING, I won't even count. I watched this death match on HBOMax, it was so boring I had to watch it over 2 days, and it was still, BORING, Keanu Reeves I think he forgot which character he was playing, he probably left the set of John Wick to go do a part on this Turkey. Hollywood should take away the Producers and Director's license and never ever allow them near a pencil or pen again. You should have left this piece of trash in the Matric Tomb, cause it arrived on the big screen DOA! Even EMTs couldn't revive this corpse. So unless you know CPR (Crummy Picture resurrection) stay away, please watch anything else, and lets hope Keanu haven't screwed up John Wick 4. Nothing could spoil this disaster.",1
95,"While it's great to see Keanu and Carrie Ann back together, this movie was a hodgepodge of old ideas grafted onto few new ones. Putting the old team back together without a cohesive storyline served no purpose. By and large, the entire thing was a retread of the originals, with unnecessary flashbacks and old footage. I was never 100% sure of what was actually going on, and I find that annoying. I'm an intelligent person well-versed in the first three Matrix movies, and there were still moments that left me scratching my head. Great visuals, but again: nothing we haven't seen before. I can't for the life of me think of a good reason this movie had to be made. The original trilogy was fine without it. Unless you're a hardcore fan of Keanu Reeves or just really, really curious, you might consider skipping this one. It really isn't worth the effort.",4
96,"Many have called it the sequel no one needed (or wanted). 'The Matrix Resurrections' most accurately could be described as a shameless cash grab by Warner Bros. (which is all but admitted in a tongue-in-cheek way in the film).Yes, it's sort of nice to see the reunion of Keanu, Carrie-Anne and an aged Jada, but Laurence Fishburne is sorely missed (no disrespect to Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). Of the ""new"" cast members, it's random at best. NPH as The Analyst isn't a bad choice; it's just unexpected. Jonathan Groff as Smith feels like a miscast, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas doesn't add anything to the story.In fact, the plot of 'Resurrections' is bland, which makes sense given the franchise should have been left alone after the original trilogy. It's pointless, though, because it doesn't take things in a new, fresh direction. The only saving grace of the film is the CGI, which has improved much since the early 2000s.The only thing certain about this 'Matrix' is that Lana Wachowski should have declined the invitation to extend its lifespan.",3
97,"I really wish they didn't make this movie. I understand where they were going with the idea and it was interesting but the execution was miserable.The plot was basically a bad version of Monsters Inc movie, where the machines discovered that by using the power of fantasy was better than keeping people miserable. This in itself would have been fine, but the way they approached this was insanely bad!Let me put it this way: if you need a ton of flashbacks to the old movies, that means your movie is not good enough in the first place.And let's address the elephant in the room. If you are a fan of the trilogy, there is no secret that the ""real"" world (where they fight the machines) is actually the matrix. So what they call the Matrix is just a simulation within a simulation, and that was the crazy twist that made the original trilogy so epic.There were a few bits here and there that were nice to watch and the movie is not all that bad, but the story kind of stops making sense with how they try to explain it away. And all of a sudden all this extreme time stopping powers are a thing now and Neo is just a rug that gets tossed around like he has no clue what he is doing in the movie in the first place. And don't get me started with all that Matrix games stuff.Animatrix was a great expansion on the lore. They could have done so much better in this movie with all of the past material. Sadly they just applied some very cringe things that Hollywood loves these days in all their movies!In my opinion they should have done a whole new story with new characters and a clever plot instead of just recycling melancholy for the franchise!This does not really add anything interesting to the lore or to the story and it's just like Terminator, they just beat a dead horse for the attention and money even after the original story has ended so perfectly!",5
98,"This one is a real disaster - even the visual quality is worse than the original trilogy. Resurrections looks like to be the oldest of the movies, the first three movies got a far superior special effects and looks. Everything feels and looks cheap. Also the pacing is just a real drag. A total fail.",1
99,"Lately, I'm learning the hard way that Awesome Trailer=Bad Movie! Wonder Woman 1984, Halloween Kills, Ghostbusters Afterlife (yeah, that movie sucked despite popular opinion), and now this film THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS (2021)...all had cool trailers yet all are bad films. And what do most of these movies have in common? They are distant sequels to originally (and still) beloved movies. I was so ambivalent about even watching this new Matrix movie that, I kid you not, when I kept seeing the name ""Resurrections"" pop up, I thought it was one of the earlier sequels! They all sound the same to me...Reloaded, Revolutions Resurrection. Ten years from now...knock wood...I'll probably be confusing all these subtitles not being able to distinguish one from the other. The first Matrix from 1999 is a movie that never really intrigued me, not really watching it until years after it came out. The appeal was the eye-popping and original and unique CGI, which is one of the reasons I felt this new movie wasn't going to be good. In the last 20 years, almost everything feels like CGI, so the Matrix is now of victim of it's own originality. The MAIN thing that was good from the first film were the effects because I could barely remember anything about the characters.Something that's always been true of Hollywood is the hot actors of the time get the plum roles and in the 90s, Keanu Reeves was definitely a popular actor, despite his limited range as a thespian. Then when an international blockbuster like The Matrix surfaces, it basically gave him a career. He can always fall back on the Matrix when times get tough. And I've never been the biggest fan of any of the other main actors from the first film either. Carrie Ann Moss, Joe Pantaliano, and Laurence Fishburne are all serviceable Hollywood actors, but nothing special, in my opinion. Moss was basically a fashion model turned actress. Pantaliano made a career of playing himself in movies, regardless of genre. And Fishburne always seemed to be a bit yet irrelevant player in random classic movies over the years, never really leaving much of an impression. But with the possible exception of Moss, at least these actors can unequivocally say they are better at their craft than Reeves, an actor who always seemed to get outshined by his co-stars.The original Matrix might be the exception with Reeves, though, because that blank clueless expression he always brings to his roles suited that film perfectly. I guess you could compare it to Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Terminator, the difference being that as time goes on, Arnie's performance becomes more iconic and you can tell the dedication with which he played the part, while with Reeves, all of his ""good"" performances feel more like the product of luck and irony. Plus his zen, nice guy image in reality seems to make him popular among moviegoers. Reeves has never been one of my favorite actors, but at least with Reeves, most people KNOW his limitations and don't overrate him as a great actor like they do a lot of others. He's accepted for who he is, which is something. The Matrix movies are just like any other random set of movies for me and so it doesn't matter who the star of them is, I'm indifferent. Unlike other iconic films that started movie trends like Psycho, Jaws, and Saw, The Matrix just isn't a film worth re-visiting or analyzing for me. It's an overpraised cool 90s summer action movie that is regarded as a masterpiece. An example of a 90s film that actually holds up and gets better with time is Starship Troopers because it's more than just action and cool looking effects and it doesn't feel pretentious like The Matrix.This long awaited 4th film of the franchise was a 2.5 hour bore, basically replacing all the rebel characters from the '99 movie with a bunch of young unknown interchangeable actors, the main of which is the blue-haired chick who I could barely understand a word of dialogue she was saying. This movie was 2+ hours of characters talking in vague dialogue, which included techno babble and being in awe of Neo, against CGI backdrops with loud music playing in the background. I've seen some uninspired casting in my day, but this film takes the cake! There was something about movie casting back in the day where more often than not, it felt right. Now, it's just let any talentless random be in a movie. At least Reeves had that intangible quality that made him marketable to the masses, but I don't foresee Blue Haired Girl being in anything after than movies made for Lifetime and Netflix. Scratch that, even Netflix is too big for her. Rounding out the ""cast"" are Old Doogie Howser, the guy from Glee, and the guy from the new Candyman. A more eclectic cast is impossible. But the kicker was Jada Pinkett Smith in really bad old age makeup. Speaking of, Reeves and Moss were both looking incredibly weary and bored throughout this film, shells of their former selves. I'd rather re-watch the first movie with it's freshness and originality than Matrix Retirement.It's astonishing that a 2.5 hour long movie could feel so empty. There was so much blandness and irrelevance in this. The main thing I got from this is that it's 60 years in the future, Neo is a legend (hasn't that always been the case?), getting Trinity out of her funk is the key to winning, Glee Guy is the new Agent Smith, Doogie Howser is the bad guy (always thought so), '99 characters have been replaced with Gen Z ones from 2021, lots of slo-mo fight scenes, LOUD music, then in the end Neo and Trinity fly away. I saw this on HBO Max and shudder to think what people thought about this tedium in theaters. But then again, I sat through all of atrocious flicks like Halloween Kills and Ghostbusters Afterlife in the movie theater, so I think I know how everyone feels.",1
100,"Lets take the first Matrix movie, strip it off all the philosophic balastand other elements that attributed to the stunning success of the trilogy.So, instead of the saviour of the mankind we have the aging John Wick analysing his life on the shrink's couch.Let's add some fight scenes, but the again the agents are so yesterday - replace them with the zombies (what the ?])and as Keanu is too old to fly on ropes , let him do the Steven Seagal stuff,cross the hands and all the enemy within a mile radius collapses immediately.Lets replace phone booths with the swinging doors from The Adjustment Bureau.Pathetic John Wick now has found the real purpose of life in the shape of a respectful mother of two teenagers, attention of her he would need to fight for.Yes, Ms Wachowski you are right, Neo without Trinity would not be completed but the same applies to the other characters like Oracle,Agent Smith or Morpheus you seem to forget about.They have been replaced by some generic actors, no disrespect to their performance,but we have no idea who they are and what is their purpose in the story.Fortunately for us the shots from the original trilogy have been inserted in key moments of the plot, these 'flashbacks' serve as cue cards to the sitcom audience -Who's that guy ? Who's that guy ? ( face of Agent Smith ) - booWho's that guy ? Who's that guy ? ( face of Morpheus ) - yikesThen at the end everyone is clapping as the story ends well, but does it really ?To be with Neo, Tiffany leaves two children of her without blinking an eye,which is inhuman, and overall sad.(Even the possibility that they are a piece of software does not justify her actions,take a closer look at the character played by Priyanka).",2

Living up to one of the best Sci-Fi and one of the most influential films of all time is indeed a daunting task even for its original creator, and trying to tick ideological boxes certainly doesn't help.We've had Star Wars remake telling us women are in charge of foolish men, Terminator was remade just to tell us the saviour is now a woman, this last Matrix demoted Neo and promoted Trinity.

A lot of the lines are cringe inducing and at times had me questioning if they had hired screenwriters who were in their freshman year of college (of which they had spent partying and vomiting in frat houses).The characters are very poorly done. The original matrix movies had established a very clear pattern of the ""attitude"" the Matrix-verse entailed, to which they threw away and threw in some very wonky and goofy choices to well established characters that was mind-boggling.It was all very poorly done.It is not worth the effort to dissect every small detail of why this movie is terrible (of which there are MANY), to which I'll leave you with: Watch this movie at your own peril.",4

Simple questions like What does the lead character want? Are unclear. There is ENDLESS exposition where characters tell us what they are doing as they are doing it. I thought it was only Doctor Who that was this bad at doing expo, but no. I was wrong. There is no clear goal. And I have no idea what is 'real' or not real. Which means there is no sense of jeopardy. I'm not sure what Neo wants and I don't know what the bad guys want or are doing and I don't know who the bad guys are. I don't know why the original agent Smith is not in the movie (must be an actor contract thing) and I don't know what is going on. I loved the original Matrix and I love sci-fi, this is just poorly written nonsense. And I am bored of this sort of movie. The original Matrix was brilliant partly because of it's original special effects that had never been seen before, there is none of that in this movie - everything has been seen before. And I lost count of the amount of times Neo used his magic shield to stop bullets hitting him, Yawn. He holds Trinities hand four times each with a big music swell. Once would have been super dramatic, four is lame. It's clear that Lana Wachowski, is not only absolutely terrible at attempting to direct comedy, but has nothing more to say and that The Matrix was really just a really brilliant movie that never needed a sequel.",2

In Resurrections, he either sounds like he's reading his lines off a cue card, or struggling to remember them.Was the CGI better somehow in 1999, or why do most of the scenes look incredibly fake? The fighting &amp; action mostly feel like they're just going through the motions...there are few (if any) ""wow that was cool"" kind of moments. Not sure how they make a 2hr 30min movie about a virtual reality world so incredibly uninteresting, but they nailed it, if that was their intention.Like many others, I was a HUGE fan of the original Matrix, and honestly enjoyed the entire trilogy. But this is just an abomination...almost a parody of the previous films. In fact, they make so many references to the first few movies, that it just makes you wish you were watching them instead.What a disappointment.",3
118,"Despite good visuals, cinematography, production values, passable performances, and a okay music score, everything else about The Matrix Resurrections is just nothing more than a lazy rehash of the first Matrix movie but with poor character development, bland uninspired action sequences, sluggish pacing, a dull story, a forced feminist agenda, and overall poor direction and writing.Warner Bros should've left this franchise unplugged after Revolutions which concluded the series' story in a good satisfying note. This was just another lazy attempt to resurrect a finished or dead IP with a unneeded, unnecessary sequel/prequel/remake/reboot, it's literally The Force Awakens all over again!",4
119,"On the plus side the spectacular special effects of this is an improvement upon the previous trilogy. It is also great that both Keanu Reeves (Neo) &amp; Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity) have returned for this latest installment!However, the noticeable absent of &amp; refusal of return from both Lawrence Fishburne (Morpheus) &amp; Hugh Weaving (Smith) is a bad omen for this, instead they choose to replace them inadequate actors in Yahya Abdul-Mateen (New Morpheus) &amp; Jonathon's Groff (New Agent Smith). Their portrayal of those icon characters are nothing more than unintended caricatures. They are pale in comparison and nowhere near good enough to hold their shoes let alone walk in them. The writers tried to write an exposition for their absence but as fans we may be sceptical/cynical of this...The storyline seemed so simplified compared to the first trilogy. I did fall asleep &amp; woke up not seeing how much the storyline has progressed. I felt as though I had not missed any significant parts. Neil Patrick Harris was the obvious antagonist that is supposed to be a big ""surprise"" &amp; when it arrived I had already knew that and thought aloud ""so what?!"" As a fan of the first 2 films of this franchise, I feel as though as a viewer I was given the wrong blue pill &amp; the title could have easily been changed in accordance.",4
120,"Seriously!!!!!! I can't Sum this up Quick Enough.TOTAL BLASPHEMY to the Original 3 Matrix Movies.As for Others rating this as better than Reloaded and Revolutions then I'm Sorry but even Revolutions beats this hands Down.I really can't Express how annoyed I am with this movie.it looked Cheaply made with Cheap Effects,The Acting and Actors used at best was on a level of Day time Tv,The Plot is all over the place.I can't Believe Keanu could watch this back and be Happy with being involved with this Rubbish.Even recent Star Wars offerings Killed it compared to this. John Wick you made a Huge Mistake getting involved with this.",1
121,"Not only does this art project suck but it should have never been made. What a letdown for a fan of the franchise...you can skip this and miss nothing and that is sad, my friends.",1
122,"...just awful. Political pseudoscientific trans PR, nothing more. Some brilliant CGI here and there, but that aside, a hip and pretentious snorefest without substance that shouldn't have been seen the light of day. Genuine Matrix fans will be heavily disappointed.",1

Bland performance from rest of the cast4. Generic plot told in complicated way5. First half hr of meta callbacks.They just wanted to cash-in the nostalgia but don't care about telling new stories.",4
124,"This received my lowest rating of the franchise. Everyone felt old, tired, and slow. But it wasn't just the characters. It was everything about it... just felt like some 65 year old ""trying to relive his glory days as HS quarterback"".It was not as thought provoking as the first, had the weakest (and fewest) action scenes. The only one that felt impactful was the motorcycle chase.They had sentients on their side... and the movie didn't capitalize on this more than just cursory.The entire movie focuses on the wrong thing: The old (nostalgia) and boring (Lets dive deeper into this guy's ""real"" life... for a f'n hour!). There's been 20 years of tech development... and none of it used to improve the movie.20 years... and *this* is the best they could come up with? Didn't even feel like a cash grab... It just felt so... like an old and tired attempt to relive ""glory days"".Definitely not worth a watch on its own. But if you're a fan of the entire trilogy, *and* you're really bored... it is mildly enjoyable.",5
125,"Makes you wonder, given parts of the script, whether she came back to destroy the movie series so that nobody else could take it.This is probably the biggest gap in movie quality from originals to current in movie history.I can only think she is really having a stab at WB execs, or was it really her other half that had all the vision?",1
126,"I got to say the old trilogy was so much better than this. The new story is just too flimsy and unconvincing that doesn't make much sense, the actions are slow paced and lacks of impact. The new casts have weak characters that didn't have the cool the old movie had, the parts with smith and trinity were just ridiculous. The dialogues were kind of silly and awkward, even the CGI was worse than the trilogy that was made 20 years ago. There were some massive scenes yes, but it just loses much of the tension then the ones before, as there were just too much allies and lack of strong and witty villains, which were just too weak and easily disposed of.",4
127,The 2 Stars goes to Neo and Trinity. The rest is BS. I have stopped watching this franchise right after the 2nd one came out because it became a disappointment and I didn't want to ruin my luv for the first one. I only watched the new today because it was on my HBO Max.This is movie is a perfect example of a franchise butchering it's own franchise... nothing but a total sell out. It's the end for The Matrix this movie is so laughable.,2
128,"Took 2 days yo watch, first half was a jumbled mess, lost interest and turned it off. Went back to watch second half and realised I wasn't paying attention and hadn't a clue what was happening.Plot - neo loves Trinity and wants to save her. If boredom doesn't set in, you may well decipher the mess that is this film.My favorite part was the scene where some old character incoherently mumbles through a fight scene.A film worthy of B movie status on the Sci Fi channel.",1
129,"Absolutely awful. Embarrassing for everyone involved. Let's get something out of the way right now - I do not understand how the Wachowski's are still working in Hollywood.Literally every single movie that they've done with the exception of the original Matrix has been objectively terrible. Icing on the cake? The original Matrix was actually stolen... at least that's the rumor which I totally believe.There have been lawsuits after lawsuits on this very subject. I didn't always give it much credit until I realized how terrible the Wachowski's are... then I started to realize... they had to have stolen this idea given the complete lack of sensible ideas they've had since the first Matrix.I mean Cloud Atlas? Jupiter Ascending? Sense8?! I usually don't criticize artists too harshly. No one and I mean no one gets it right 100 percent of the time. Sometimes a great idea gets corrupted by the many hands that inevitably get involved in the making of a movie. Even doing a short film takes a small village. But, after watching Resurrections I've never been more sure that the Wachowski's are absolute hacks.People seem to think Covid is the reason no is going to theaters... I think Spiderman just crapped on that idea. Plus every film is getting a hybrid release so why the heck would anyone bother?!No, theaters are gasping their last breath because audiences know that the unbelievably expensive experience of going to a movie is not worth it! Can you imagine taking your family of four which would cost upwards of $100(just on tickets) Then the additional $50 plus on the extras(popcorn,candy etc)... then watching Matrix Resurrections?Forget a let down... that family was cheated out of money that could've paid a bill or two. I have HBO Max... and I have it for free(i have at&amp;t) and I still feel cheated!As long as Hollywood keeps crapping stuff like this out you can totally count on the absolute end of movie theaters and as far as i'm concerned... good riddance.",1
130,"Why??? I have watched the first 10 mins of the movie about 10 times then finally glued myself to watch the whole movie, it's stuck between a drama, comedy and action movie, I don't even know if the movie know's what it is. Boring concept, confusing acting, good action but not enough to save a movie that should never have been made.",2
131,"They made so many mistakes in this movie. First, twenty years have passed in real life. For no reason they decide to make the setting 60 years into the future. This is probably entirely an excuse to cut Laurence Fishburne out of the character list. However, this didn't hurt Keanu Reeves because he looks, acts, and moves like 60 years really have passed. Then, they screwed up by reviving an already defeated bad guy, Agent Smith, whose story lines were the reason Matrix 2 and 3 were nowhere near as good as 1. In doing something so idiotic as reviving yet another character whose actor is still alive and well, you would think they would use that actor again for that role. Nope. They weren't willing to negotiate the timing of filming with Hugo Weaving, who was very willing to reprise his role. Strike two. So, they screw up the timing for no reason, and two of the major characters get replaced for no reason, and where do you think they will go? All new ground? Nope. They rewind back to the beginning with horrible flashbacks from the original films like one of those rerun episodes of a tv show. Well, it's been twenty years, so I guess not everyone remembers everything about the films. Still a major flaw that deserves strike three for certain. However, I watch bad movies all the time, what made this one so bad that it was only two stars? They actually hired Jada Pinkett Smith to reprise the role of Niobe. Sounds great, right? Right? She did an excellent job in the originals, but because they set the timing of the film 60 years into the future, they had her reprise her role as 60 years older. She did a horrible job pretending to be forty years older than she actually is, and the makeup didn't do her justice either.Story 1/10Visuals 5/10Acting 1/10Direction 0/10In conclusion, this is by far the biggest cash grab and worst reboot sequel I have ever seen. Don't waste your time and money if you care even a little bit about a decent story in the films you watch. Even the action was pathetic. The only good thing in the entire film is when the character, Bugs, says, ""What's up, Doc?"" That's it.",2
132,"Truth? It started out extremely well, I was really intrigued by the Inception reality fold. The action sequence was also fantastic, reminiscing of the original Matrix series, especially with the first action scene with Bugs. Then... all down hills from there.The constant flashbacks was the first really cheesy feel. It was the scenes chosen and the way they did it, almost comes off as product placement of old nostalgia. A few of them in the right moment might've worked, but they completely saturated the film with it, even at one point putting it on the big screen in a movie theatre in the film. That was just cringe worthy cheese.But the action sequences from that moment on just became really boring, uninspiring and again, gimmicky like one of the new Bruce Willis cheesyfest B level action films. There were none of that awspiring slow motion, choreography, etc... like the first triology. All the action sequences from there after were just flat out boring, and cliche.However, what made this film a real bomb for me was the acting itself. Both the new version of Smith and the Architect (which is now called Analyst), were so... what's that word, like hissyfitty. They don't project that ""machine"" like quality which draws a certain aweness in the audience. Compare Neal Patrick's scenes with the original Architect and you'll get it. When Neo faced the Architect, you really get that feel, the Architect is a God character. Completely self-assured, no fear, knows all, etc... The Analyst is like a cheesy knockoff, metro hissy beta boy. Same with Smith.They got rid of agents and replaced them with something called swarm, which is basically zombies. And that's just ... cringe cheese. It is so cheesy that they even have one scene which is a nod towards ""Train to Busan.""But I did like the theme, and the message. Basically it is addressing the current woke culture as sheeples, people who want to be controlled, and that feelings are easier to control than facts. Woke culture is basically the new Matrix in this film, if you didn't pick it up.The script is also a bit long, it runs beyond the 2 hour time without any real substance to run 2 hrs. So again the major problem with this film is the director, the choice of action sequence, casting choice, the script errors, etc... otherwise would've been a really good opportunity. So a swing and a miss.It is a definite watch for nostalgia, but I can't give it more than a four and would like to forget about it when I go back to the trilogy. It is as if it didn't exist.",4
133,"Wow more than 2 and a half hours of pointless dialogue with zero comepelling conflict, no antagonist, no point, no emotion, no decent action scenes and absolutely no character development.How a movie gets made when the script is this bad is astounding.",1
134,"This is one of the worst movie I ever watch. One question: why!?The story is ridiculous. The acting, laughable. And it's visually way less impressive than 20+ years ago. What a waste of time. Should have never been done$$$$$ rules the film industry.",1
135,"May I ask what the purpose of making this was, when the trilogy had already concluded the story?This movie is a parody of itself. It will make you appreciate Reloaded and Revolution more, just like what Disney did with the Star Wars prequels.First of all, I don't know wtf I just watched. And I don't mean that in the sense of ""woah dude, that was awesome, I can't wait to watch that again to understand it more"" and more like ""were Lana Wachowski and the other writers on crack while writing this?"" Like what the actual f was the point of this movie?It wants to be a sequel, it wants to be a reboot with new actors, it wants to be a political statement, it wants to be a 2:30-hour trailer for a much, much, much better film and what do we get in the end? A mishmash of some fairly good ideas with a horrible script and story and without any of the charm of the first movie or the fight choreography, cinematography and clever storytelling, and it's just another cash grab at the end.The first hour of this movie is just callbacks after callbacks after callbacks and recreating scenes from the first movie. The movie is constantly giving itself autophelatio for the first movie they made and the metaness and self-awareness of it is just cringe in its pure form. Like who's brilliant idea was to go full Deadpool for their franchise? All the scenes of the game devs were horrible. They could've cut the cringey game dev parts and focus on one thing they wanna do, either make a sequel or reboot it with new actors so we could have at least a mediocre Matrix movie, not this horrible abomination.The whole movie, or at least the first half, feels like a fanmade movie about The Matrix with people cosplaying these famous characters and trying to act like them and it's really weird. But I'm sure if someone did a fanmade Matrix 4 they'd make something ×10 better.There are so many plot holes and dumb moments that I'd have to make a 1000-word long spoiler review for it but it isn't worth wasting time on it.The action is sub par and if I tell you name one iconic scene from this movie, let alone an iconic action scene, you wouldn't even remember what happened. Because that's the movie, an unforgettable, unnecessary sequel to a franchise that's been untouched for 20 years.Imagine having Chad Stahelski in your movie and this is the quality of action and fight choreography and cinematography you offer to the audience.Neo literally does nothing in this movie. Can you believe it that Keanu doesn't even hold one gun in this movie?There are really awful and nonsensical dialogue in this movie, but for me, the ending dialogue of Trinity and Neo about rainbows takes the cake.This movie didn't revolutionized anything, not storytelling nor action and character development. The only thing this movie revolutionized was how to ruin a 20 year-old franchise with an awful sequel, Hollywood style. Was a long time since anyone done that beautifully to a franchise!You'd think if after 20 years you're gonna make a sequel to your trilogy that had an actual ending and the story was completed, you got a banger idea and a pretty damn good reason to do it, but nope, that's Hollywood for ya, bringing back old franchises just to ruin it with political agendas and dumb writing for a few bucks.So what did we learn? Nothing. This movie is boring and forgettable. You don't care about any of the characters because this doesn't feel like Matrix. Hell, even Neo and Trinity reuniting didn't feel like anything.If you want your image of the Matrix trilogy ruined, then watch this movie and enjoy it. The first half is just movie Deadpooling all over the screen and you could literally make a 15 minutes recap of the original Matrix with the amount of footage they reused here. And the second half is just nonsense after nonsense and the ending shot is highly laughable.I wouldn't be surprised if they brought back LOTR or Harry Potter back just to push their cringey agendas and political views and ruin them too. Oh wait, they're already doing that with the Fantastic Beasts movies, and would you look at that, WB name on their posters too!",3
136,You talk about the first movie thats fine. But these little clips showing us are utterly terrible. And they just kept going and going.So I gave up after 30 minutes but then I just had to know what happens in the movie so i watched the rest. And its not bad. Its good actually. Just some things still make no sense. Like the clips from the first movie are in all the wrong places. We know all the stuff they show us but we dont know what they didnt show us. Like who is that group of homeless people. Why no flashback here when it would have made sense.Also not having Hugo Play agent smith really lowers the movie by a huge margin. Not having morpheus is explained because of the time gap. But no Hugo was the worst part about this movie.,8
137,"The movie is basically the modern version of The Matrix (1999) with no substance. Parts of the movie dragged on a bit to the point I fell asleep. Never in my life that I've been to the movie cinema that put me to sleep, and this movie did it for me.",4
138,"This movie was a total disgrace from start to finish. IF I would have seen this in the theater, id have walked out and demanded my money back. LUCKLY I got to watch it at home and ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it because it was so stupid and boring. Might as well as called it Matrix Recapped, not Resurrections.Astounding that some people are giving it more than 2 stars... absolutly astounding..There are very very few directors that can make keanu look like a worthy actor.. it's almost the same as music singers that are horrible, but the producer works some magic and then you might have a hit. If you have seen any of Keany's own directing you might see the point I am trying to make.. HE CAN'T act, and he sure as heck cant direct..If you paid money for this movie.. i'm sorry.",1
139,"The original Matrix is the only good film out of all four.But this is truly awful.The writing is a mess and I don't mean confusing, it's just really badly written and sooooo boring.I never felt engaged with any of the characters at any point of the film.What's worse is that I thought ""ah well, at least we'll get some good fight scenes and special effects"".Oh boy was I wrong!The fight choreography and cinematography were really sub par during all of the action. It felt like amateur hour.I expected this film to be middle of the road. It's a lot worse than that.",2

141,"Quite a Blast from the Past. A continuity of the Matrix Phenomenon where Neo have to repeat the previous choice from the first movie and seek reunion with his soul mate while facing a new and updated Matrix.I grew up watching the Matrix and experiencing the conundrum of defining reality, this movie was successful to bring back that light, it held tension and curiosity yet it failed to bring something new to the table.I didn't care much for the redundant plot or our modern ""garbage cultural"" references in the movie which were weak, lame and cheesy but the moral dilemma and the same philosophical questions remain...As I cared more for the refreshing dose of those buried questions that give humanity a meaning and a purpose.How do we define our reality? Based on our limited knowledge and science as most narrow minded do nowadays? Or is there more to our existence? Is life what we ""comprehend"" with our limited 5 senses? Are we slaves to what scientists claim to be real or true? Do feelings such as desire, love, hate, fear, anger...etc what make us alive and content? Why are most humans blind followers even if they don't admit it without considering to question if what they were raised to believe to be facts is True or False? I'm talking Religion, Political Affiliations, False Patriotism, Racism...etc. Did you really Make these choices or the one raised you made them for you and you are just content? Are you really a human with the freedom of choice or a member of the herd who is going along with the flow because they feel comfortable in their own daily silly version of reality?... Simply, who is willing to take the RED Pill and who's content with the Blue one?On the technical side, The Matrix Resurrections lacked originality when it came to a sequel but the original one still echoes in the air! Full of two dimensional characters and silly one liners. On the other hand, the movie succeeded where most recent DC/Marvel movies have failed in in employing the good CGI sceneries ""Not too much and Not little"" but I feel the writers intentionally neglected the trilogy fans who haven't played the online game miserably! The Morpheus matter was a huge let down but at least they were true to the whole series.If you watch The Matrix Resurrections as a casual flick, you'll be amused but you may miss all the hidden messages but if you open your mind and consider the RED Pill, you may start to see the world for what it is.",
142,"A Very badly made movie full of Woke nonsense with bad acting and all thanks to the Wachowski family for ruining an awesome story as they did great work with the trilogy and Jupiter Ascending was the best Movie this family ever made,... Was hoping for either a prequel or a sequel to Jupiter Ascending?Some nice scenes and effects, although i do like Jessica Henwick who adds some great acting to the movie.I can't really find anything else to say about this release, other than, the Wachowski family should have never been allowed to have made it.",4
143,"Matrix: ResurrectionsWell this was the remains of a Christmas turkey that could not be resurrected, it was perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen but not as bad as the mother of all turkeys namely Carry on Columbus.The plot was twaddle, interspaced with inane profundities, the plot twists beyond ridiculous, the acting on a par with a primary school Christmas play where nearly everyone was a tree.Who commissioned this tripe should be sacked, along with the script writer, director and producer. So many careers have be ruined by this misguided sequel on a sequel on a sequel.I hated every minute with a vengeance, I felt cheated and robbed of the ticket price and so did everyone around me, it was unintelligible tripe, for me this is a minus 25 outta 10, but I will publish 1 on here to register my extreme dissatisfaction.",1
144,"Ahh Matrix 4. A better title would be ""Cash Grab Pile of SH**."" It has all the Matrix aspects: cool looking characters, Keanu Reeves as Neo, Trinity, fight scenes, cool tech. And yet, as a huge Matrix fan, this was painful to watch.So we have Doogie Howser as an unbelievable bad guy. Laurence Fishburne not returning as Morpheus. This is a sequel 60 years later with older Neo &amp; older Trinity but somehow Morpheus is young??? A silly plot basically summed up as: the Matrix was just a game developed by Thomas Anderson/Neo (now on the blue pill side after everything??) who's in love with a married coffee shop regular named Tiffany/Trinity. And now they're back in the Matrix so Neo can ""save"" Trinity. Meanwhile, the machines are at peace growing strawberries with Matrix humans.It makes no sense. I hate it. Why was this made? It ruins the franchise's name. I really wish I could unsee this.",1
145,"THE MATRIX blew my mind when it came out. Maybe not everything made sense, but as a whole, it was a fresh, cool, visually stunning film that made its way into pop culture like a hot knife through butter. It was a perfect product of its time, cutting-edge, visionary.THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS is nothing like that. Virtually every aspect of this film is a tired, sad, worn-down version of THE MATRIX. And yes, even the sequels were not that pale in comparison, even though they already were a big downgrade.The action is bland, the plot childish, the characters a bit boring, the acting unremarkable to bad, the camera at times amateurish and never even close to the great style of the original, but the score at least doesn't distract.If it has any purpose at all, this film serves as a reminder how good the original was. It painfully reminds us how much better films used to be not too long ago, but let's also be honest: this is also just a cash grab - one that of course also tries to pander to ""modern sensitivities"" by tacking on a ridiculous social justice commentary ending that was as unnecessary as this whole film.",3

Because someone does not agree with it or is offended by the smallest infringement upon their fragile glass psyche.When can this be America again?",1
147,"I knew it was going to be garbage from the moment that, just a few minutes in, they said something about having a non-binary view of a situation.This movie checks the entire woke garbage list: diverse strong female character with funny colored hair, gender-less names, every character from previous movies that was strong and determined and stood for something is now weak and hopeless, women are stronger than men, fluids are stronger than non-fluids, young self-entitled brats save more mature people etc etc. The woke stench is unbearable.Moreover, all Matrix-specific things are wrong: the effects are worse, the fights are worse and look cheap, the dialogues that were in the past almost palatable now make you vomit. All the substance and close-to-intelligent things in previous movies are now absolutely gone. This is devoid of any meaning. Just an endless recycling of all the hooks from the previous installments, done laughably bad.I watched it only to see how far down they will go. Boy, they went to the Mariana Trench.And of course in the end Neo becomes an almost useless appendage to Trinity, because the heap of garbage that Matrix was from the very beginning is just a chronicle of the Wachowsky's journey from men to women. A bad joke played upon the whole planet.I was expecting it to be bad, but not THIS bad. Started at a score of 5, which means much lower in reality, given the well-established practice of big studios to flood IMDb with fake good reviews. I expect this will soon go down to 4.Perhaps Lana needed a new rack?",1

This was only fake sentiment, fake punchlines, fake fight scenes, etc. I believe we, the fans, weren't prepared for such a disaster or were we?

I was right to be hesitant, because this was really, really bad. I feel sorry for Carrie Ann Moss and Keanu Reeves because I know they loved these characters and to have them placed in this terrible story was criminal. Just so you know I kind of liked the idea of a Trinity/Neo love story told against a resurgent Matrix. The characterization of the Analyst and Jada Pinkett's reappearance were some of the high points. The new city and some of the other ideas concerning humans and machines were on point. But the low points were really low. The silly Agent Smith and the other barely fleshed out, unintentionally unnecessary side characters really got on my nerves. Unfortunately, these side characters include the new Morpheus. Where was Fishburne when they needed him.Also, I agree with playing homage to something great but there was far too much repetition which means there was a serious lack of new writing ideas. It's really a shame because this could have been a great, kickass, love story instead of the slow, cheesy thing I watched.",3
158,"Laughably bad !Relies heavily (by ""heavily"" I mean ""only"") on nostalgia. Builds nothing. Tells nothing. Totally useless movie.When will they stop producing this kind of cashgrab ?",2
159,"It is astonishing how low the Matrix has sunk. This movie tries to escape its reality with some meta humour but it fails. The movie is just bad. And not only is the story terrible, even the special effects are terrible. Every single fight sequence feels like it has been composited in 10 fps, as it has no motion blur. Every one single action scene is a slide show.",3
160,"Where do I begin?I watched this via a digital feed and it was so bad I almost walked out of my own house.A hotchpotch of remade scenes and flashbacks from the original trilogy mixed with badly scripted new scenes showhorned in between to try and push a storyline.No one wanted this movie, no one asked for it.",1
161,"Why does this film exist? To destroy a franchise, of course. Just like the last Terminator film.The film tries to out meta itself, and fails miserably. It's pretty ironic when a film that is an unnecessary reboot tells its audience unnecessary reboots are a bad idea. ""Resurrections"" explains that the events of the previous films are series of video games created by Thomas Anderson, who doesn't remember he is Neo, or that those events actually happened. Oh, and Trinity is alive too, but now she's Tiffany. There's an angry female hacker with a short blue, I'm offended by everything, haircut, who is central to the plot, because of course there is. And the woke critics are gushing over her, as if she's the greatest Matrix character of all time. The story itself is basically Sleeping Beauty. The effects are laughably bad. There's horrible editing, countless production mistakes, and mediocre fight scenes. This is one massive fail.",1

163,"I have to say that I was really disappointed with this movie. Growing up with the originals, I remember how ground breaking they were and how much I looked forward to each one coming out. I know that you can't necessarily measure this movie against the trilogy and I went into it with that outlook but I still found that it just lacked the feel that the originals had, it didn't feel like the matrix completely.This movie seems like a mess, like they tried to cram 3 more movies into one and as such it moves very fast, to the point where I found it hard to even follow. I personally didn't like the casting for Agent Smith, I felt like he did not bring the same menace or authority to the role. You never really see Neo develop his skills, it just kinda happens. Also the constant snippets of the previous movies peppered into the movie did not fit for me, just seemed weird how they added that in.Overall this could have been so much better and honestly I don't think this movie adds anything to the original trilogy and nor does it add any real closure to the story or characters so I have to question what the point even was. It's weird because there is no plan on turning this into a trilogy, it's just a one off so what was the point? I give six stars because it made me nostalgic enough to want to watch the original trilogy again and the acting was good, the special effects were good. It's just a shame that they robbed so much from the originals and put them into this movie. Sometimes you watch a movie and it feels like they are making the movie just to make a movie, just because they can, not because it should be done. If you don't watch this movie, then you have not really missed anything.",6
164,"The Matrix is my favourite film of all time but the 2nd and 3rd films didn't live up to my expectations, so I wasn't holding out much hope for Resurrections. It saddens me to say this was, indeed, a poor film.Although films 2 and 3 weren't as good as the original, they did have some spectacular action that made up for the convoluted plot. Resurrections is all convoluted plot and substandard action.The constant flashbacks to the original just served the purpose of reminding me of how inferior this film is. Still, you have to watch it if you're a Matrix fan. Just don't expect fireworks.",4
165,"When I realized that Lily Wathowki isn't participating in this I lowered my expectations maximum. I truly believe Lily in their sisters duo stands for the best approaches we love their films so much like intellectual aspects and multilevel plot's twist.This movie is fully based on the elements from the past but made poorer and more simplified. There is no single scene to be marked as iconic or even remembered like the ones from previous films. To be honest, the film itself isn't that bad and could be much worse but definitely not a good one!I truly hope that one day they will make it up together and we will be able to have more solid movies like they created before.",3
166,"So, the movie started with 20 minutes of the film actually justifying its existence to the audience, then 10 more minutes explaining why some characters have been recast.I mean those timings exactly, as I looked at my watch to see how long each of those sections were, and it was 20 and then 10 minutes exactly.That's a full 20% of the bloated 2.5 hour runtime. There was so much bloat in fact that they could have cut an hour out easily and had a tighter, leaner, better film.This pointless self-justification felt whiny and self-absorbed, instead of being meta commentary as Watchowski intended, which did not endear this film from the start.The first 30 minutes should have ended up on the cutting room floor, replaced by approximately 5 lines of dialogue.During this 30 minute beginning justifying being made at all, it kept calling back exactly to the original film, trying to make you like this film better by association, by reminding you of better films.Despite them specifically saying, during a scene about writing a fourth Matrix and having no idea what they were doing, that philosophy was a factor, but it was the basic philosophy of a 10 year old.The other factor, which the stupid meta crap whining about studios also said, was action. But the action was bad. Really bad.I'm not kidding, it was amateurish. Too much was going on in every fight scene, there were too many camera angles, which it cut between WAY too much. This rapid cutting reminded me of Taken, trying to hide how inadequate the actor was to the task.The geography was all screwed up, with too many people all doing things in the same area at the same time. The camera angles were so off that you often had no idea where anyone was in relation to each other or in the room.It made the action scenes a confusing mess, trying to figure out who was doing what and to whom.The most entertaining part for me was spotting the actors from Sense8. I spotted Will, Daniela, Wolfgang, Felix and Bug. That was more fun than the film.To be fair the blue hair girl did a decent acting job.But everyone else seemed not to want to be in the film. Maybe it was me, but I did wonder if there were some contactual obligations in play, or if the pay cheques were high enough to cause a grudging signing of contacts, but not enough to care about the project or the quality of the end product.The end credit song just plain annoyed me. Why have a girl child do a crap cover of a Rage Against The Machine song? Why not just have the actual song, if you have to licence the song anyway?I get it, girl power, nerf the dudes, have a girl 'take back' the end cover song while trinity literally carries a man (pun because Carrie Ann).It sucked basically. Not badly, but it was weak structurally and was pretty poorly written and directed.",3

The rest, is basically cringe worthyStory... convoluted and confusing...Acting, well, meh, but they didn't have much to deal withSpecial effects were badMartial arts fights were long and unnecessaryActually, no idea what was actually good about it... OH WAIT, that dialogue in the office with 'boss' - How warner brothers were making it with them or without them.. That was true... fair enough.. they got paid to write this junk and got jobs for everyone else...Time to wait for soundtrack to comeout to listen to white rabbit :)",3
168,I'm a HUGE Matrix fan. It's sacred to the Gen X generation and probably a lot of others. This was so bad that it's not worth it to even spend valuable time on it. Dreadful. Horrible. Awful. Insulting. Stupid. Childish.,1

170,"The matrix trilogy is my favorite trilogy of all time despite Revolutions. Once I heard who was directing the 4th film and saw who was casted and then the worse news of all that Laurence Fishburn is not returning as Morpheous, I set me expectations really low. The film had a few cool new elements but the story and cast was a mess. This film proved to me what I suspected all along once I found out years ago that the script for the Matrix was indeed stolen by WB from an aspiring writer. It's easy to tell this film was like a driver who had all the directions but then ran out of them and became lost. It's sad really because it had potential in the right hands.",4
171,"I stopped counting how many timed I've seen the trilogy after 27. That much of a fan I was. I went to the cinema today and can't believe how bad Resurrections is:Arhythmic choppy editing (not Staenberg's genius from the previous trilogy), messy choreography (not Woo-ping's), shallow music score (not Don Davis), no punch lines, no iconic scenes, forced dialogues, disgusting costumes, camera too close or too far, no process of awakening, wrong character arc on Neo, no progression or connection between scenes and character appearance... You should have seen everybody's disappointed faces leaving the theatre. I'm happy Hugo Weavings and Laurence Fishburne weren't in the movie after all - at least their careers were left intact. The worst part of Matrix Resurrections is that it is so ridiculous that the great philosophy behind it is now dampened, buried, or even mocked. I just can't believe it. Matrix died when the Brothers also did.",1
172,"SHOCKING! 20 years and this is the best they can come up with?! Another awful remake, the characters are a shadow of what they once where.

Absolute disgrace to the original trilogy these modern day writers and film producers should be ashamed what they've done here.",1
173,"Nostalgia is the only reason I am giving it a 3.I didn't imagine 20+years later with today's technology that a film could actually look worser than the originals but this one does, awful lighting, everything is dark, scenes are to chaotic, sets look fake, and I could genuinely forgive it All if Neo still felt like Neo but he really didn't, it was like he'd just walked onto set after filming John wick, they really should've trimmed the hair. Why wasn't he cool either, Neo had grown into the bad ass ninja of the matrix and I was waiting, o so badly waiting for the long black crisp coat and shades &amp; for him to feel like ""the one"". Instead they turned him in to trinity's side kick, I mean come on. I love the originals every single one of them, have watched them over and over again and always enjoy them, 20 mins in half way in, always engaging, but this, this was a travesty to the unique nature of the franchise &amp; unless they had genuine passion to improve and further the story they really really really should have not bothered!",3

175,"A shell of a story filled with many iconic scenes from The Matrix past and even more holes. I have mixed feelings. The Matrix Resurrections was nostalgic (kinda), but the characters and story peek so far below the threshold set by the first Matrix movie that I was left disappointed. The movie feels like an attempt to squeeze a few more $$$ out of an iconic franchise. Don't be surprised if this is the start of second trilogy.",5
176,"They ruined the franchise with this 4th installment. It felt like a B grade straight to dvd movie. The action broke immersion, terrible acting, bad story. Even Twilight has a better love story than this trash.",1
177,"After the original Matrix, the two sequels went from bad to worse, and with this one, to worsest. I don't know how to describe this monstrosity. That's what we get with a woke director, whose work had been going downhill since coloring his hair rainbow... I gave it a 1/10, because there's no zero to rate it.",1
178,"Agent smith says things like OMG and robot sentinels give fist bumps now. Though failing to capture the magic of the first movie, I could appreciate the other sequels for trying to expand the universe and keeping the same tone. This one purposely makes a mockery of itself and calls it self awareness. I'll stick with watching the first one only for now on.",5
179,"I'm sad to say this one is a hot mess and the only good bit of it is in the trailer.Where do I start...There isn't much point to the story: there was peace between humans and the machines but still they go and get Neo for no apparent good reason, causing trouble.Neo, the hero, is now weak and not able to do much except a shockwave every 2 seconds. In fact he doesn't do much at all in this film other than be there. If he wasn't, it wouldn't make much of a difference.The other actors are just bland and forgettable. I've just watched the film and already can't remember what the new agent Smith looks like. I certainly didn't feel any threat from him, or the architect for that matter.Unfortunately Jada Pinkett Smith is back and unfortunately she's even worse than in the previous installments. The caricature of the old woman is laughable, seriously.Too much of the film is about watching the first film on a smaller screen inside this one. Not flashbacks, no, just scene after scene of the 1st one projected on surfaces. Is it to pad it out to make the run time or to try and give fans something to like?And then the characters having to explain and spell out the back story, and the plot, and their plans, and intentions, and feelings etc. You know it's a bad film when the characters explain the story and what they do to the audience.Overall it feels like this film is to The Matrix original film what Scary Movie is to Scream.",3
180,"Where to start...I'll try to be brief:-The flashback scenes from previous movies made me want to watch that again instead of this.-Trinity isn't actually ""in"" the movie until past the 90 minute mark, (it's a 2 and 1/2 hr movie).-The ""new"" Morpheus is terrible. He tries to emulate the original by watching him from the ""video game"" (more movie clips from the old movies), and comes off really cringey.-Every new character is just a copy from the original but with different names. Blue hair woman is a new hero we don't want. Great Value brand Trinity is a total ripoff. Same for new Tank and new Agent Smith.-Stupid story, bad writing.-Maybe the action scenes saved it? If you're expecting nice, wide angle shots with well choreographed scenes and the signature bullet time camera rotating around the action, well there's absolutely none of that here. NONE. Instead we get zoomed in camera shots and quick cuts.If you grew up with the original trilogy like I did, you may remember many people calling the 2nd and 3rd movie, ""Matrix Refunded"". I didn't particularly agree with them at the time.This movie deserves that title. This shouldn't have been made and exists only as a cash grab. It honestly feels like a spoof in some aspects too, and the ""scene"" after the credits is even more proof of that.Glad I watched it at home on HBO MAX instead of paying actual money for this trash.",2
181,"In 1999, Matrix was an absolutely mindblowing and utterly singular movie theater experience that will stick with me forever.In 2021, Matrix Resurrections is a total trainwreck of a b-movie, a badly written and directed mess that was hard to sit through. Please delete it from my memory.",1
182,"If Seinfeld was the TV show about nothing, then this film is the movie about nothing. No real direction and very simple plot made this film a (insert over used cliché here).At 6:17 to about 6:20 you can clearly see Bugs sliding down the Anderson Hotel sign and attached to that sign is another sign that reads, ""For those who love to eat &amp;%^$""",2
183,"Lana, its time to stop. Let's all agree with that.This movie only comes to prove the franchise should have stopped on the first movie.And I am a fan of the first 3 ones. Big fan. But this fourth chapter is mostly a parody of what the Matrix universe once was. How can you associate the first movies with a videogame, even if that was part of the plot for having Neo trapped inside a new Matrix? A videogame series, really? A company having brainstorming sessions discussing how THEY would come up wit ha fourth Matrix (!) just because Warner was pressing in? The final peace agreement between humans and machines having Neo and Trinity being kept as batteries because, what, their ""power of love"" was generating enough energy sparks to power up the entire machine city on the surface??? C'mon, now, doesn't that feel like a shallow resolution for such a wide and dense universe?Weak justification to reboot the series. I would honestly stop this train right now, if its to continue with this weak idea.",2
184,"Movie is horrible, I am a fan of the series specially the first one but obviously, this is a money grab, lazy writing, recycled plot.Like swiss cheese this movie is full of holes nothing new and original just one last money to squeeze a few more dollars based on the first movie, do not pay to watch this movie it is super boring, kind of movie you can play at night to go to sleep.",1
185,"Matrix 4 is one of the most pointless sequels ever made. While the score is good and the actors try their best (especially Keanu and Carrie), however it can not make up for the horrible direction, lazy and confusing writing, meta commentary that's more frustrating then funny, characters that I don't care for, some characters are just plain horribly executed like Morpheus, horrible cgi that makes the other films look better in comparison, and the most shocking thing is the action sucks with mediocre choreography, lazy cgi, and shaky cam. Don't watch this movie. Unplug yourself from this franchise and free your mind of this crap.",2
186,"Why did they make this movie ? Why do they need to destroy what the origin Matrix meant with each subsequent movie ? So many things wrong dont know where to beginKeanu basically sleepwalks through this.The new Morpheus has no personality. It's like a sitcom for himToo much wokeness. Neo is far from ""the one"". He basically just an appendage present to generate hype.Bad dialogues and story. No depth. Trinity probably has the lowest screen time but ends up being the hero. No character development .Plot twists just for the sake of plot twists, no reason. Nobody dies. Everyone wins. No blood spilled.Agent Smiths character is completely destroyedAction sequences are so lame. U can clearly see the bad timing in the choreography .Essentially they Game Of Throned this. The original matrix was gritty, real, action packed, well thought out. This one is just a vague caricature of what was and will remain one of the greatest films.",1
187,"My energy level went from 100% from seeing the title on the screen to 0% by the time the film was over. It lacks all of the magic that made the first three films so special. No cool fighting scenes, and Keanu wasn't even wearing his signature outfit, he looked more like John Wick, than Neo. I'm sad to say, that not only didn't I love this film, but I couldn't wait for it to be over. I gave one star, for the matrix title, one star for Neo, and one star for Trinity, because I love all three. Had this been a standalone film, and I knew nothing about The Matrix, my rating would have been the bottom one. Such a long wait, for nothing.",3
188,"2h of blah blah and nonsense talk, dry poor performance, even the action scenes were poor. Not sure how Keanu agreed to make this movie. Very boring, the dialogue was full of none sense. And adding Priyanka Chopra - who BTW is a very bad actress- won't make it any good.",1
189,"Hard to say if this is boring and awful, or awful and boring. Yes we have a couple of diverse characters to please woke hollywood, but didn't we have that anyway? The only thing I can think of is that the original just wasn't woke enough. Is that what we have come? How sad.",1
190,"The first matrix was a 10/10 movie for me. I love everything about it.The next 2 movies in the series were ok in my opinion. Not on the same level as the first movie, but it still felt like they were part of the same universe and they did have some spectacular scenes and music.Then comes Resurections.I felt nothing watching this movie. Both me and my wife were really bored throughout the entire runtime.Same as matrix 2 and 3, it was plagued by pacing issues. Really long portions of talking where the story just loses its momentum.The action scenes were extremely dull and boring. Felt like watching a cheap straight to dvd movie.The chemistry between the characters was lacking. Also, really missed having having the iconic Morpheus and Smith there for the ride.I don't know, to me it felt like every part of this movie had something off about it. Definitely the weakest in the series.",1
191,"The most frustrating thing about this unneeded sequel is that it begins with so much promise. A film that doubled down on the early premise of a Neo losing his mind trying to determine if the Matrix was real could have been interesting but once the ridiculously named anomaleum (I guess that's where they keep their Unobtanium) has been mention for the fifth or so time it's clear you aren't going to get any subtle philosophy.From a third of the way through onwards the film is at odds with itself. It pokes fun at pointless, corporate mandated sequels, then precedes to serve up something that feels exactly like a pointless, corporate mandated sequel. It's at great pains to tell the viewer that the events of the earlier films really mattered, but if that's the case why am I watching this?Something about the whole endeavour feels small and low stakes compared to what came before making it hard to feel invested in the dull, drawn out climax and you get the feeling that if everyone involved was really invested in telling more stories in this world they could have found a much better one.",5
192,Remember Star Wars: The Force Awakens? This is basically the same thing. Gender role flipped. The bots felt like zombies and the fact they made the matrix seem like it was a video game was super lame.,4
193,If you do like Matrix... well this movie is not for you. This is some kind of a edited garbage with an awful screenplay and a superbad direction.Is 2 hours and 27 minutes that don´t come back. Be wise enough to avoid it for your own good.,1
194,"Usually when I see 1-star reviews I think to myself ""Just a bitter fanboy venting his anger, no movie is this bad"" and yet here I am.Now I'm looking at this movie from a perspective of somebody that watched the Original back in '99 when it came when I was 20 years of age.That being said, Resurrections is just bad in every aspect.I dont know how 20 years of technological development can lead to a movie having poorer fight choreography and sfx than something 20 years old but somehow they managed to pull that one off.The characters are forgettable, even Neo and Trinity feel out of place.Where Hugo Weaving was as charismatic as it gets as Agent Smith his new face is just laughable. Same goes for NPH as the new architect, neither of them ever seem like a real threat. They're just there for some reason nobody understand least of all the writers and director I think.The entire plot is convoluted and non-sensical to the max.If this was a reboot that cut its ties to the original then I'd be fine with that but they had to shoehorn Neo and Trinity it via deus ex machina(yeah, remember the sacrifice at the end of revolutions ? They're still alive cause the plot needs them to be).I literally felt ashamed for having seen this movie for what it did to the original. Revolutions was bad but at least it could claim it brought the story to ending.Just dont watch this...pretend it never happend, I know that's what I will do.",1
195,"What a narcissistic piece of self indulgent garbage. They spend an entire 20 minutes telling the audience how awesome the writers are, and trying to claim they were the first to write about about the blurred lines of reality and the dream of illusion by tyrannical forces, as if Phillip K Dick wasn't writing that in the 60s, and movies hadn't been breaking our grip on reality for decades before 1999.It really is just a tv clip show. Visually its all uninspired callbacks juxtaposed with clips from previous movies. Hey member morpheus, member squidbots, member old tv in white room, member oracle, member machine war. The old clips were used in place of creating new interesting scenes, while the only actually new scenes were tired reshoots of old scenes.Speaking of Morpheus, he isn't in it. Neither is Agent smith. Well the actors aren't. They merged the two characters in a bit of lazy writing to try and excuse the fact that the two actors that stole the show, the two actors who were more memorable than the protagonist, aren't in this film. (Technically both smith and morpheus are in the movie separately which makes their explanation that they are merged all the more confusing and stupid.)They then replace them with some... disappointing choices. Especially the use of Neil Patrick Harris in his hammy comical way that works in movies that are comedies, not so much for supposedly serious film. During a scene that was supposed to be climatic and serious, he pauses the action to utter, ""Aye yai yai"" seriously?!Worst fight scenes of the series. Like really bad, no substance. A lot of obvious misconnected hits that you can pause to see the air, that were clearly supposed to hit. Knives moving through the air make metal scraping noises, and just generally bad fight dialogue.The dualogue in general is horribly written and performed.There's no reason to ever watch this movie. Its nothing new, and an obvious narcissistic mastubatory indulgence by bad writers who don't realize how bad and hackneyed they really are.",1
196,This is movie is a pure and simple cash grab. So glad I didn't have to pay for this movie that never should've been made. Sure Keanu Reeves is amazing but the script is so bad it's laughable. More than half the movie is just shots and scenes from the old movies.,1
197,"After watching the film, I was disappointed. It really turned out to be a half-sequel, half-remake of the original film - that is, the main story is almost the same as in the first part, even some scenes are copied almost frame by frame, only some details are changed and new characters are added, which cannot be compared with the old ones.The original Matrix still looks better and passes the test of time, it is better to revise it (well, the whole trilogy at the same time).",6
198,"Feels like they are taking a dump on it, showing scenes from previous movies? Even action scenes have weird camera angles and slow mo effect like they do in low budget movies. 3d part of movie is ok, they kinda went with blurring 3d scenes. Half of the movie is explaining what happened and what is happening with flashbacks. In short, if you are a fan, you are going to regret why they made it.",4

All previous Matrix movies didnt involve women empowerment, or gays, or Disney looking cute robots that act like some cuddling dragons from ""How To Train Your Dragon"", they didnt have Deadpool humor or 4th wall breaking, and didnt make fun of characters like Matrix 4 did with Merovingian, insulting all previous Matrix movies.

205,"This movie is a high school production of a fan made script based on the matrix that somehow got the budget to hire some of the main casts and rights to flashbacks.I honestly dont know who is really to blame here... is it the audience and viewers who lost interest in anything deeper than surface level and just watch everything or the companies that pump bad movies out when there is no good version of the movie to put out? Cause they make money and people go watch these absolutely awful movies and there is really not enough bad reviews or angry tweets to break this cycle of quantity &gt; quality.Its not just this movie or only the cinema, 90% of tv shows are just pretty visuals with zero depth and trash writing.I am just tired to hope for the next movie or show to come out and see its another shallow lazy full of cameos and ""cool"" references with nothing meaningful to offer...",3

207,"Where do I start? It's pretty awful to be basically blunt. While it was great to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss back in their famous roles as Neo and Trinity, they are vacuous hollow copies of their once iconic selves just going through the motions and obviously picking up a decent salary at the end of filming. The plot while fascinating from a certain point of view once you can stay awake long enough to see what the director/writer Lana Wachowski has dreamt up for the return of these classic heroes quickly falls apart and you learn that this isn't The Matrix follow-up film you've needed since 2003. The Matrix Revolutions ended properly two decades ago despite it's huge flaws - it was a Matrix film. This lame effort from 2021 flips the story, the aspect and lore on it's poor dumb head. The pacing was dreadful, the plot at least for a Matrix film was wholly idiotic, the supporting cast were unremarkable and forgettable, the classic screen hue of greens and blacks is replaced by bright colors and gloomy black palettes, the special effects are garbage for a film series reliant on amazing special effects, no memorable fight scenes or stunning chase sequences. I don't know why Lilly Wachowski didn't return to directing duties with her sister Lana, but that was a huge mistake judging by the finished and final product. Lana has clearly pumped current social woke trends and commentary into the script and it suffers for it focusing more on the politics of following other big franchises being brought back for today's audiences and deliberately ruined that falls in line with Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel and DC and Watchmen. The sight of the blue haired girl from the Matrix Resurrections trailers gives a big clue to where the direction this film goes to and you won't like where it heads to and the reveal at the end.",4
208,"I admit I really wanted to revisit the Matrix world again. Also, I admit I wasn't sure what additional, meaningful storyline they might have left to explore. Seems they didn't after all.Liked the Neo/Trinity reintroduction.I was able to embrace the ""it was just a video game"" to move to the real story.Now on to the dislikes:You couldn't get Lawrence Fishburne?You could get Niobe but not Morpheus?After the reintroduction and exposition on why Neo was again Thomas Anderson it rapidly degraded.After it degraded it became laughable for the wrong reasons.After it became laughable it became abusive to their audience.There were two characters that mattered and nobody else.When you have a movie or trilogy about a central character and you get to know and enjoy that character but then you find out it was the bit character that actually mattered.It fails to be a big reveal when one character is dangling in the grip of the other character or they will obviously fall, was it necessary for that character to declare that that character is not ""doing this""? Not even remotely.I am sure they thought they were so clever about the parent company Warner Bros forcing them to do the 4th or they would and could do it without them. I wish they had done it without them. This is one of the few times I wish I had missed a sequel and maybe somebody new would have done better.To summarize, no plot, no story, no tension and no nostalgia. I gave it a 4 but I am going to have to come back and give it a 3 or 2 in the next couple days when I settle on one or the other.",4
209,"Where is the old good agent Smith? What a big nonsense to put an other actor. Don't make a feeling of fear,terror and inevitability.Where is old Morpheus? The man what takes the Neo off virtual reality? The new look nonsense aswell.Where is the green filter and dark-wet atmosphere? The movie is too bright and colorful, too much frames per seconds, the image don't go stable,and camera changes every 2 seconds.Some times the actors are animated , and their quality looks like 2005-2007 years graphic. Even old 3 movies have much better personages animation. The visual efects are Cheap!!!The end is a new start..please lisen to us..and bring the old atmosphere back )",1
210,"I SO badly wanted this movie to be epic. I really wanted to see Hollywood finish off 2021 with a strong offering, because the world is laughing at us, and they think we are all foolish and ignorant. Movies have been our greatest artistic and cultural offering to the world for nearly a century. In fact, our movies have changed the world. They have defined generations, and moments in time by capturing peoples' hearts and minds in every corner of the globe.Sadly, just like this movie itself, Hollywood has lost the plot. We have praised actors like Keanu Reeves, but like many other legacy actors, he plays the exact same role in every movie. You could easily take scenes from all the Matrix, John Wick, and most of his other movies, and randomly string them together, and it would seem like one long movie. While I applaud some of the awesome things he has done with action movies, like learning how to fight and shoot very accurately, it doesn't make up for the fact that he just keeps playing the same character over and over.I have so many issues with this movie. First off, I had to stop it 4 or 5 times to get up and take a break from it. They tried too hard to make it feel new and that time has passed... literally there must be 25 to 30 references on how time has passed and how things are different now. This movie is like a mockery of itself. I don't know what these people were smoking when they wrote this script, but it must be strong stuff.(I'm pretty sure we are aware that time has passed, guys. We are not toddlers. We get it. Time has passed since the last ''battle''. Can we move on, and get a grip please? Thanks.)The cold and dark grayish and green hues in the production was visually appealing and brought me back to the vibes of the classic first Matrix.... and that's the only reason I am even giving it 2 stars, because other than that, this production was shocking - shockingly terrible.The visual effects have actually DEGRADED. What is going on in Hollywood? If we can't even get the visuals right with a huge budget, and an ungodly assortment of movie studios in Los Angeles, and the best of the best of everything at our fingertips, what are we good for? Have they not seen the STUNNING visual effects coming out of Russia lately? Yes, RUSSIA. If the Russians are putting out better CGI effects than Hollywood, I ask, what in the hell are they doing in Hollywood? Too busy pushing the propaganda and hiding in the shadows and being terrified of getting the sniffles and a cough?I could type for hours about this movie, but it's not worth my time. Very sad. Very depressing. I am not impressed. We can do so much better!!!",2
211,"Such a pathetic sequel to a great film. Why they even made for such an spoof take on a Masterpiece. This is totally a missed oppertunity. The story was so poorly written and the action sequence sucked. They even filmed the movie digitally, making video look throughout the film.",2
212,"I can recall the first movies with the post credits saying directed by ""The Wachowski Brothers"" and thinking these directors were far ahead of the game.It was a little suspicious not having both on board for their crown jewel movie. The sad part was the astounding amount of flashbacks they added to this movie; the best parts of this movie were just replays of the best scenes of past movies. The industry has passed them by and this movie is stuck in the past. They tried to pull on the crowd's nostalgia and replaying the most memorable past scenes between fan favorites Neo, Morpheus and Trinity.Shame on the Wachowskis. They need to transition out of the past.",1
213,"Not sure how anyone would be on board to do this movie, the script is trashThe only good thing about the movie is that u get to see neo and trinity together again.Dont watch this movie if u like matrix, ending it with nr 3 is completely fine.",3
214,"Its great to see Carrie Anne Moss get some decent Hollywood bucks for appearing in this waste of time, but apart from that, this isn't something that anybody will bother watching again ... There isn't one new idea, either plot wise or visual in a follow up to a major iconic piece of cinematic history ... The last two were drivel as well, so they should have caught on that it wasn't going anywhere and like most of hollywood sequels were just another cash grab due to being determined not to do anything new ... hollywood is STAGNANT ...And this this piece of tired filler has already gone.",3
215,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie. I loved Matrix 1, the second and third were ok but no where near as good as 1. However, matrix 2 and 3 look like masterpieces compared to the 4th movie. I have no idea how it ends as I give up after 30 minutes, it was honestly more interesting to go and watch the grass grow, nothing happened to keep me watching. The plot seemed as dull as a brick, the characters were even worse, I mean what did they do with Laurence Fishburne? They just replaced one of the main most likeable characters with a different actor that was half as talented, like some bad soap opera production. On top of that Neo looked like what Keanu Reeves is now, an old man struggling to keep up. The full cast where dull and boring, with zero likeable characters. It was clear after 30 minutes that this movie should not have been made. As good as the original movie, this leaves a bad stain on the original trilogy. If you want my advice, do not even wait for this to go to blue-ray, just do not waste your time watching it. I hardly ever give 1 out of 10 but this was so bad, I find I have to be honest and give it what I think it deserves.",1

You used to give us great trilogy like Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbits, this latest Matrix is how you rewarded your faithful Matrix fans?",4
218,"The Matrix started a revolution in how we perceive movies, how movies are made and how stories are told. The Wachowskis did an amazing job with the first 3 installments in The Matrix saga, however this fourth chapter is something nobody asked for.First of all, there are old and new characters popping in and out of existence just like that. We really needed a closer look at Trinity's personal life inside the matrix to make her struggle more believable, for example. We needed to know more about the new crew.Second, the CGI seems somewhat worse than 20 years ago.Third, fighting is now more about pushing. Walls get the real punches, characters push each other real hard.Finally, the ending is weird and once you see it you know this movie is just not taking itself seriously any longer. I could easily skip this movie and pretend it never happened.",3
219,I love Keanu Reeves but this is an abortion. Doesn't get much more work than this. This ruined the other three for me. If you Pokey comic book movies than this is your dig. Of course you're completely missing the message that they're giving you but then why would I think otherwise.,2
220,Nobody asked for another Matrix movie. Recycled things from other Matrix films. It's all about Trinity. Every 5 minutes has a flashback. Very bad Agent Smith. Is not worth to see. The Merovingian character is wasted.,1
221,"20 something years ago, I used the original Matrix to write a very successful film class, a version of which survives to this day... but this film is simply dreadful ... it started out well, it really did ... I thought ok, it's meta, it's commenting on itself, there is some self effacing humor and hopefully it's going to go in a good direction.... It never did ... it got dumber and dumber and more annoying w/ each passing moment ...I think when Niobe appeared it went irretrievably south ...her performance was abysmal and the story at that point became unnecessarily convoluted and lame ...What else? The flashbacks were superfluous... the Morpheus character was cringe factor number 9 and totally unneeded ... in fact there are too many damn characters ...Neo is too damn old ...I had to force myself to watch it until the end. And you know, they could have made something out of this, cut 30 or 40 minutes out, get rid of all the unnecessary characters and flashbacks, stay on message about humanity preferring feelings to facts or preferring illusion to reality and bring this big mess to conclusion in a timely fashion. ... and oh, stop trying so hard.Maybe film is dead if this is the best that can be offered ...",3
222,"History is repeating or maybe not. Neo (Keanu Reeves) returns to his Matrix character, programmer Thomas Anderson. His game, The Matrix, has become a sensation and he's working on the next edition, Matrix 4. He spots Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) in a coffee shop but she's a wife with two kids named Tiffany.This starts by repeating the original Matrix. I like it. I like the meta qualities. Mostly, it's good that Lana Wachowski figures out that this is about Neo and Trinity. The best scene has to be their meeting in the coffee shop. In a way, this is their meet-cute. Their relationship was never developed beyond being epic written in the stars type of formula. They are finally able to have a regular romantic scene. There is real energy when her husband walks in but it's a slow decline from that point on. NPH's reveal is oddly infuriating. He's doing a light comedic riff and he's far from computerized. The movie slowly drowns in its Matrix action and Matrix expositions. At some point, I'm lost with all the gobbledygook from the movie. It does maintain its focus on Neo and Trinity. That's something.",5
223,"In fact, just about everything here feels lazy. The writing is bad, really really bad. The actors try to do what they can, but they too appear lazy. The horrible script was just too much to overcome. I did notice quite a few other reviews wonder why did the actors take on such a mess. I am asking the same. My only suspicion is they took this miss for the money. Not that they're hurting for money, they just wanted this pay day. Why else would they accept such a disaster?I'm not giving any spoilers, because there aren't any. There literally isn't an answer for anything. Not an answer for questions left from the original 3, not an answer for unnecessary questions in this one. It's all very confusing and not in an intellectual way. It's confusing in a messy way, a lazy way. In fact, this mess is as confusing as the writers and directors are confused. Their confusion bleeds all over this mess.At least we have the action, the cgi, the music...NOPE. Nothing here improves on, and in fact seems inferior to the original.Watch it on HBO MAX to see for yourself. Don't spend the $50+ at a movie theater to only walk out feeling cheated.",1
224,"Please save your time and sanity from this utter, utter failure of a movie. It is like the editor and actors had a massive attack of schizophrenia and pieced together scenes that shouldn't exist in any sequence. There is absolutely no coherence in the editing and old Keanau Reeves gives one of his most terrible performances to condemn this movie to cinema infamy, though it is the direction and nonessential characters that steal the low light here. It took quite an effort to stay awake in this three hour marathon slog, though I kept hoping for some flashes of the old movie magic. Sadly, there was nothing redeeming in this movie and the end was a massive relief. A termination to this utter monstrosity that the Wachowski family deemed fit to unleash upon us. An abomination.",1
225,"This is a weird one. Honestly I thought it was fun and enjoyable at times, but it's overall ruined by many pitfalls.The beginning acts as a meta-commentary on bad cash grab sequels, but this movie ends up being just that which is pretty ironic.The biggest issue with this movie though is the action is the worst in the series. Instead of keeping the great matrix style action, they modernize the action in a way that is so boring and average that you just fall asleep. And it's insane because there are so many modern action movies that have excellent action like John wick. And obviously I don't want the movie to just copy John wick action but it ends up just getting rid of the matrix style action completely and we're left with the most basic choreography you have seen. Not to mention the fact that neo does literally the same move over and over, pretty much the definition of a boring match in a fighting game.The plot of the movie is actually interesting in the beginning. I was actually confused and wondering what was gonna happen next, but after the first 30 minutes it is streamlined to the most basic thing ever. It is so boring and so dumb and it is so hard to care. Most of the plot is just boring action scene, boring dialogue scene, line that's supposed to be funny but isn't, exposition dump, and then fill all of those scenes with flashbacks and references to the previous 3 movies.Every newly introduced character in the movie I could not say a single interesting thing about them. The only memorable characters are neo and trinity. Also the replacement for Agent Smith is in my opinion not a good choice, he doesn't resemble Hugo Weaving in the slightest and I honestly forget that he's supposed to be agent smith until they shove in a flashback showing that he's agent smith every 5 seconds.The movie isn't all bad though. The first 30 minutes I actually really like and it felt like it was setting up to be something actually good. I know I have dumped on the action but it's not like it's awful, it's just in comparison to the previous 3 movies it's disappointing. For a modern action movie, the action is in the middle. It's a popcorn movie and it's fun enough at times, but it really doesn't feel like this movie has any soul, everything is so mediocre and by the numbers. Really your enjoyment of this movie is based on toleration of these issues.",5
226,"Sorry, but why Hollywood feels the need to make sequel after sequel or prequel is beyond me. Watched on HBOMax and it barely kept my attention. Not sure why we needed this installment.",4
227,"I happened to see ""The Matrix Resurrections"" shortly after finishing ""Twin Peaks"" (2017), another much-belated return to a beloved franchise. Because David Bowie died before he could reprise his role in that series, David Lynch turned his character into a talking tea kettle. That made me wonder how much ""The Matrix Resurrections"" would have improved if Lana Wachowski had replaced the pathetic remains of her characters with a set of assorted tableware.",3
228,"This was nonsense. They toss you into this story with no background, no understanding or explanations, no you get to piece it all together piece by piece. Then to boot, we find the Wahmans who isn't afraid of an Agent, no, she would fight him instead like she's so ""bad-ass"" that she can deal with an agent instead of running like they should.Then capture our hero, worn and tired, lifeless and weak. All through the movie, this doesn't stop. Sure he wakes up but still doesn't have nearly the power he used to, can someone say impotence = I knew you could. This meanwhile while we hail ONLY the women of the trilogy while dumping on Morpheus and Agent Smith through out by reminding us how much better the original trilogy was (in the movie). Absurd breaks of the 4th wall, and a complete on-the-nose awareness of things that breaks any belief in this story at all.Combine that with political propaganda, not as heavily dosed but still obvious, add a few dashes of ""The Message"" and some CGI, tada this crap was put together. Watchowski failed to realize the story of the Matrix because they didn't write the original, they had a lawsuit for theft of the idea that was settled. Thus they failed to write the follow ups to the original (they weren't nearly on the level as the 1st). This movie takes a loaded duce on the Trilogy, Neo, the Fans, and any poor soul to view this trash.",1
229,"Fresh off screening, phew, what a ride, felt like a butthole surf. I miss the maturity of parts 1/2 here, everything feels cheap, rushed, like nobody cared that much, just paychecks flying here and there. Didnt care at all about all new chars, bad editing, disastrous difference/contrast between quality shots and the ugly ones, lame choreography of all action scenes, unnecessary action, the music oh my, where is it at all? What is that generic orch sound from scene to scene, and that feminised RATM song on end titles made me laugh loud.The only thing that was ticking my brain thru the whole movie, that red line - how the hell we did end up in this alternative butthole world with the nwo, covid, all that tolerancy and stuff, the neverending buttshow of the generic everything, twofaced wronged reality. Can we have a hard reset please? How the hell did we end up here? Are we that bad that we deserve things like neverending marvel and reboot spinoffs like this Shmatrix and the latest The Predator shlock?",1

About 20 years passed and no interesting ideas appeared?Is a shame this movie is called Matrix.I was pretty mad viewing the first part wich was some kind of parody with characters lacking interest.Then the movie just forgot it is intended to entertain the viewer.Such a disrespectful movie to its legacy.",1
231,"At first, I was really exited when a new Matrix movie was announced. And seeing Trinity and Neo meeting each other again in the trailer was like seeing old friends again while remembering, how much you have actually missed them.But this is all this movie is, an old friend you have missed for nostalgic reasons. And you will realize very quickly, that times have changed. Your friend has changed, i.e. You have no longer a relationship to the things he is doing now. And doing the same old things over and over again, does not work anymore.The Matrix Resurrections delivers nothing new and gives no answers to old questions. And when you see something cool, like an interesting scene, you realize that it is a shameless 1:1 copy of one of the original movies. Due to the lack of the old team experts, the dialogues are often simply awful, the fight scenes horribly choreographed, filmed and cut, and even the acting of the main characters is often oh so uninspired. Keanu Reeves was never an outstanding actor but the portrayed character has little to do with the Neo we know and love from the original trilogy. You can say he is ""doing the Bruce Willis"". That is, wondering around like a sleep-walker, giving the impression like he does not give a ""you know what"" and taking part in the movie for other reasons than making a great job.The Matrix Resurrection feels like a documentary about the original Matrix trilogy which is at least one hour too long. With pictures of and references to the old movies, to look back for nostalgic reasons only. But thinking of it as a movie, it is absolutely awful because there is no reason to do a movie like this after such a long time when you have no interesting story to tell and not the resources to uphold the quality of the movie franchise.",3
232,Saw it in theaters and was confused like 30 minutes in. This whole movie feels like a parody. It doesn't take itself seriously and breaks 4ths walls which is a weird direction to take the matrix series. The first movie is fantastic and can never be topped. Unfortunately this movie fails to even prove itself to the audience. It was nice seeing Keanu and Carrie on screen together again. This movie did not push the series forward but mostly left it stagnant. This movie tries to be funny and serious at the same time and it doesn't really work. This ain't the matrix movie people were asking for.,5
233,"Why does Hollywood utterly screw up franchises with wokeness? Don't waste ANY time on this. It's boring and lame. Bad acting, bad story, bad execution. Where was this going? I don't know, and lost interest FAST!",3
234,"Ok, no spoilers here, the plot will provide enough for you.I can't really think of anything good to say about this and unfortunately it's probably worse than the previous two which were far below the high benchmark set by the first.This felt hollow from the plot to the script to the acting and even keeping Reaves and Moss couldn't save it. They looked like total strangers, no passion and no energy between them. Massive overuse of clips from the first film to patch things up but that just became annoying, it felt like a memorial to the original.I watched this 2 days ago and can't really remember the plot and i'm half decent at remembering films but there was just so little to it, instantly forgettable. I didn't enjoy the need to push the CGI with the fluid character of Morpheus or the friendly flying cartoonlike creatures. It felt gimmicky and cheap.The fight scenes were dull and overlong as well as the slow mo and the shooting scenes more ridiculous than ever with aim visibly off but still hitting every target. It was all just. A bit of a stretch and that's saying something for a matrix movie.If you loved the original you have to watch the film but don't have high hopes. The ending was particular dull, cringy, anticlimactic and empty. :/ pretty disappointed to be honest.",3
235,"Just over halfway through and it was so boring I couldn't even finish it. This is coming from someone who loves the original and liked the sequels. At times the movie makes fun of itself and it is obviously meant to be funny and ""meta"" but it mostly just serves to point out how stupid it is.",4

237,"The Matrix Resurrections (2021) :Movie Review -The Wachowski's first attempt in The Matrix series 'The Matrix' (1999) left viewers and it's spellbound it with its ground breaking idea and mind blowing presentation. The Matrix still remains the best film in the franchise and one of the finest sci-fi-action film of our times. After the wonderful achievement, Wachowskis made two more films, 'The Matrix Reloaded' (2003) and 'The Matrix Revolutions' (2003), but frankly both the films couldn't really match the first one. However, these two films have been enjoyed by certain fan-groups for more complex and illusional storytelling. After waiting for 18 years, Lana Wachowski has given another attempt to revive the franchisee with The Matrix : Resurrections, which has some issues of its own but the fans have enjoyed Revolutions, can enjoy Resurrections too. I am certainly not one of them so count me out already.After denying the possibilities of a fourth Matrix film back then, Wachowski has finally come up with the new idea- co-written by David Mitchell and Aleksander Helmon. Resurrections is set 20 years after Revolutions. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is living a normal life as a game developer under his original identity as Thomas Anderson in San Francisco, California. Trinity, as Tiffany (Carrie-Anne Moss) too is living a family life but then appears a new version of Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) to take Neo back to The Matrix- by his own choice. He offers the Red pill which reopenz Neo's mind and brings him back to senses. Neo joins the group of rebels to battle out Smith's illusional world, and rest you have to see in the film. The screenplay is unnecessary slow in the first half causing a boredom, but the second half has picked up well. It's confusing at some points, that's not surprising, because we are into The Matrix Universe and that's the USP factor here. But it is not impressive either. Why does it spin so much? Nobody knows. You will enjoy the villain factor though. It's surprising, and wondering.The Matrix Resurrections has got new faces in the cast- Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Morpheus, Jessica Henwick as Bugs, Jonathan Groff as Smith and Neil Patrick Harris as a Neo's Therapist. Yes, you do miss Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving, who played perhaps the most popular characters after Neo and Trinity. The replacement can't found but let's not blame it on honest performances of Yahya Abdul and Neil Patrick Harris. Watching Keanu Reeves being helpless in few scenes may feel bad, come on man, nobody likes to watch the kick-ass hero begging for something. Nevertheless, he does his part nicely and Carrie has supported him well. Our Desi Girl Priyanka Chopra appears towards the end for like 10 minutes but in very important sequences. Bugs is too cool for a female rebel, whether it is looks or action, Jessica Henwick is damn good there. I loved her haircut. Niobe was missing in action, however, she makes her appearance noticed for a while because the elderly form of Jada Pinkett Smith is familiar to what we have seen in Star Wars (Don't laugh).The action scene in Resurrections will please the hardcore fans. It has the similar techniques earlier used with the boost of new technology and instruments. Visually, it's as good as the previous films and the VFX team has done a really good job. Lana Wachowski's vision gives 'Another Chance' to the franchise and to the fans, yes that's what it is 'Another Chance'. The Matrix Resurrections is definitely watchable for the new attempt, fantastic visuals, good action and complex storytelling. But it is not enough for the recommendations. Wachowski has tried everything to give a new life to The Matrix series and it's somewhat successful too but something is lost. The soul mainly. You just don't get that feeling. Overall, strictly average and can be watched once.RATING - 5/10*",5
238,"There's nothing to say. They put NO effort into this movie and thus, no effort should go into the review.I will say that the latest gimmick in making movies that are clearly cash grabs is in being cheeky about it and writing it into the script. Producers seem to think that if they wink to the audience and acknowledge what it is, then that makes it okay. That garbage might work with dreck like Fast and Furious but it has worn out its welcome. But it doesn't matter. There will be several sequels to this and people will flock to see it, the same way people keep going to Star Wars movies, despite the fact that they're all awful.And then they will re-boot it again and start all over.God I miss original ideas.",2
239,"Thomas Anderson, now without his indelible nom de guerre Neo, is a game designer in a constant state of unease, mostly cause he's not living the life he should be. Begins with a bit of nostalgia for those fond of 1999's debut, but fails to go much further than that; nearly two decades have passed since the last entry, yet despite any technological advancements in that time the special effects are pretty mundane, and the fight scenes try (but fail) to replicate the earlier films as they lack tension or innovation. Much of the time Reeves looks like he should be elsewhere, he and Moss only have a shell of their former chemistry, and even worse: new casting in previously iconic roles along with multiple flashbacks warrant a shake of the head as to how vastly inferior this latest showing really is. A lot of talk and explanation, likely to convince fans that there was a valid reason to produce this disjointed sequel in the first place; just what was the goal here? *½",
240,"It starts of disappointing, and just keeps getting worse the longer you can stand watching it. The script is so meta that it resembles what you'd expect from a parody. It's a disgrace.",1
241,"*Angry Spoilers Ahead*The Matrix Resurrections made me appreciate two of the most underwhelming sequels to one of the 1990s' masterpieces of Hollywood filmmaking; and man did it do its best to be as 'meta' as possible whilst being too preachy and pandering to the whole 'lack of originality' in entertainment as a whole. This whole film was a massive disrespect to the original's 'four quadrant' appeal and accessibility even with its sci-fi trappings.The Matrix Resurrections is the death of a reboot before it even began its course properly; this film was a thematically and nonsensically desperate attempt at kickstarting yet ANOTHER sequel/reboot in the 2020s-landscape. The screenplay was a garbled (and failed 'high-concept') think-piece of contradictory ridiculousness, the direction was wonky and everyone besides Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss are woefully out of place in The Matrix world.Basically, the story tries to be self-aware yet contradictory of the previous entries in a 'clever' way; Neo's now a game designer, everyone is either an agent or manipulated piece of machinery determined to stop his escape, Morpheus is reincarnated as some non-specific hive of drones yet has the memories of Lawrence Fishburne's take on him, Niobe is a million-years-older now, Neo uses The Force in the form of Kamehameha/Hadoken-beams, and Trinity is the second 'Chosen One' (or something). This film is a multi-million dollar mess of the HIGHEST order. It hates the fact it's a sequel and basically relishes in condescending jokes about how 'meta' everything is in The Matrix now. Must explain how The Agents now shoot like Stormtroopers, the scenery screams 'Member-Berries' on steroids, Neo has forgotten Kung Fu except for lines of 'reference' dialogue (explaining the whole Force thing earlier). It's clear the film has no idea if it's an ACTUAL (or comprehensible) story or reference-fodder trying to cancel everything out that made The Matrix special in the first place; it's kind of implied that everything's made up anyway so nothing here really matters. So what was the point of The Matrix Resurrections? To kill any future the franchise might have had.I must say: although I hated the film in the end, I didn't go in expecting to hate it the same way people on the internet have clearly echoed in DROVES by now; but the sh!t this film spewed in all the wrong ways made it a somewhat beautiful disaster-piece. It gets EVERYTHING wrong and doesn't even feel like a proper movie by the time you get to the climax. This is awful cinema. Though I commend Warner Brothers for green lighting such a batsh!t crazy script AND backing it with money people only dream of having themselves.The Matrix Resurrections is cinematic assassination by misappropriation (and COLOSSAL misunderstanding) of a beloved property. Hopefully no more Matrix movies are coming. My God.",1

The big issue for me was literally realising that there was no point to bring Neo and Trinity back.Fight scenes were scarce and unoriginal. Any fight scene with Neo was comprised of him windmilling his arms about and causing explosions, instead of the stunts and action sequences we saw in the last films.It's all personal opinion but even Keanu Reeves repping the John Wick look annoyed me - he just didn't look like Neo.Lastly, the ending was just...???? I won't go into any further detail but it's only really left more questions. Smith was never satisfactorily explained...he just disappeared.

Even the program version of Morpheus dancing around like a moron doesn't sit well with me. The action scenes are no longer breath-taking; we simply get excessively cut, cheap, low-budget action. I won't even touch on the feminist agenda going on here.One little thing I enjoyed about this movie was some of the thought-provoking dialogue every now and then, but beyond this, I've got nothing positive to say.After watching Matrix Resurrections, I wonder who at Warner Bros approved and signed off on this.If Warner Bros decides to take a swing at yet another Matrix movie in the future, or even thinks of expanding the cinematic universe of it to the levels of Star Wars or Marvel movies, I think the filmmakers should not only revisit the original film, but also look for INSPIRATION in other films like Tenet, Inception, Interstellar, and The Thirteenth Floor, along with modern comic book films like Doctor Strange and Spider-Man: No Way Home.",1
247,"The film tries to be something and doesn't even scratch the viewer's surface, it talks, talks, talks and doesn't cause anything. Apparently trying to be mean on purpose to criticize something they don't even seem to understand.Paying to see it in the movies gives a big feeling of money being thrown away.",3
248,Just awful. Seems like a parody of matrix made by a film student first time directing. Pointless lousy dialogue. Why why why? Feels like it was shot on a handycam.,1
249,"A strange movie in many ways. It's not awful but I cant say its good either, especially compared to the original trilogy.Odd mix of returning actors and ""bargain bin"" replacements.Story is a jumble, especially what happened between the trilogy and this movie. Main plot is also diffuse. Nothing in the world seems to have changed at all really since last time.At times the movie looks nice and at times it looks like a Netflix show with a low budget.With its considerable runtime it works as a timewaster if you need one but if you are fond of the originals I would preserve the memory of those intact.",4
250,"Not able to sit through the half way mark. The sheer boredom of the dreary dialogue, weak action, even weaker characters, was too much. I gave up. Can't provide any spoilers because it didn't get anywhere by the time I switched off.Terrible.I have nothing else to add.",2
251,"But to be truthful, mostly just denial, anger, and depression. This is one of those movies that the longer you sit through it, the more you regret it, until one eventually submits to the frustration that they just wasted 2.5 hours of their life they will never get back.It is also a chore to sit through, like it takes work. I left and came back 4 times to get through it.I really don't recommend this movie, and if you loved the first Matrix or the trilogy, I even more recommend staying away, so as not to taint your fond memories.",3
252,"When you thought Hollywood can't go any lower. Surprise! What a train wreck this was...the director is complaining in the first minutes that W. B needed a quick cash grab and that's why the movie is being made, lmao, no joke, i was struck when i heard it, i knew right there and then this is a s. Fest, what the hell man/women or whatever you are? Why not just stop complaining and make a god damn good script! Stop crying. Stop putting gay propaganda in movies, no one likes this crap, I'm not gonna do myself in the back just because you think you can brainwash me. You people are ruining the way of life on this planet with your stupid woke b.s. Everyone should live free.",1
253,"I must say, I have the utmost respect for Mr Reeves,the way he exudes humility and respect. In saying this, I found this movie highly disappointing. I was rooting for him and the Matrix franchise but what was delivered was complete sub par lazy content/screenplay which was both horribly ""cheesey"" and riddled with cringey moments.It seems like The Matrix has sold its soul to try milk out any last bit of financial return possible.",3
254,"The movie makes no sense at all. The story that has been told in this movie can not be by any means a sequel to the Previous movies. I wont explain further and detailed in order to avoid spoilers.The action scenes are very poor and far from the legacy, Basically are a bad remake of the action scenes in previous movies. I wish they have not made this movie. Not to say that they have ruined the previous ones. They can't! Every movie has its own value. However, They have closed any window of opportunity for a good sequel to the movie.There are some good ideas in the film but those cannot save the whole mess. It is in overall a bad movie and by comparing it to the Previous films and judging it based on the main story of the Matrix, it is a terrible one.I can safely say that it does not worth your time.",2
255,"I can't believe what I just watched. The og Matrix was groundbreaking in action,cg and philosophies .A thought provoking mind bending action packed film with memorable characters we remember and still quote to this day .The sequels were just unnecessary but are decent action movies. Which brings us to Ressurection a shembles of a film that turns Neo and Trinity into the stupidest boring characters. The brilliant Laurence Fishburn who brought gravitas to the og trilogy is only seen in flashbacks (scenes from way better movies) but theres a hip new Morpheus who makes jokes every 2 minutes. There is a new agent Smith too that is now a hipster cracking bad jokes. The plot makes no sense the action is all shaky cam and the less said about he cgi the better. I still dont get how a movie that came out in 1999 on a 60 million budget has better cgi ,fighting cheorgraph ,costumes,backgrounds ,cinematography and music then a movie made in 2021 with a 200 million budget just mind blowing .Wow bravo Warner Bros you've done it again.",1
256,"The Matrix Resurrections is directed by Lana Wachowski. After 18 years we return to the the series, as Keanu Reeves reprises his roles as Neo and Carrie Anne-Moss as Trinity. If your a fan of the films you know that Revolutions didn't end the trilogy on a good note. It was very anticlimactic ,convoluted and a mess. So how does Resurrections stand up to the legacy? It's anticlimactic convoluted and a mess. This story has no drive, no pacing,no satisfying payoff. The problem derives right from the beginning. The pacing is terrible the whole hour and half is really slow,relies extremely heavy on callbacks and Flashbacks. Really half of this movie's essentially stock footage of the trilogy. The characters are looking right at directly or being shown every 5-6 minutes, it's almost demeaning the audience intelligence like children. Every clip to describes past events, reminiscence, to remain you that yeah that character existed. Talking about the characters their terrible. Keanu's the only one who actually Isn't really himself for the majority of the movie. He tries love him although you can't expect one guy, to hold up your movie. When the protagonist is restricted for the whole film, when everybody else around him is bland and serve no purposes. You know nothing of value about any of these new character's. There's no team chemistry. Many of the returning characters don't add anything. Trinity is absent most of the time, and when she show up she can just do things. Morpheus(Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) you have no connection to him, he's not laurence fishburne. He tries way to hard and has no real connection to Neo. You could have just said that Morpheus was has died end of story. He does so little in this he barely a character. Smith also not play by Hugo Weaving's back. Why is he here? It makes no sense, his actions make no sense. Overall The cinematography is a mess the action is generic most of these fights are really soulless. Resuses actions nothing really new or creative fight style like rapid pushes and Neo just stopping Bullets the whole time. Nobody really feels like their in danger. There's no tension what so every in this so you don't care about anybody. The villians is a joke althoughit almost seem like that's almoston purpose. This was just an all around disaster Resurrections adds nothing to the franscise. After so long it fails to capture any of the deep philosophical meaning or intense action that the original or even some of the other installment did. Leaving nothing but a cash grab that try to make something far past it's popularity.",4
257,"It was so obvious this film was created on a low budget: I'm really confused why someone would shoot a Matrix movie on cheap TV cameras, like the RED Komodo which cost a few thousand dollars. Recent big budget films such as James Bond - Time to Die have delivered a beautiful cinema look by shooting on actual film. The Matrix films were lauded for pushing the art of special effects forward yet this new film looks like a made for TV affair. Horrible overuse of poor quality juddering motion blur wrecked the movie for me. The colour grading is also very cheap, gone is the lovely dual colour palette of the reds of the machine world and the green subdued hues of the matrix. Now there is nothing much separating the two worlds. I suspect this was done on purpose but now we are left with a bland visual movie. The matrix films were all big budget special effects movies and this new film is a low budget drama affair. I don't think I've seen a film where Keanu Reeves talks more than in this film. It's heavy on the dialog with a few crappy fights thrown in. The saddest thing is many people will pay good money to see this film at the cinema where it just looks and feels like a low budget made for TV affair. Hugo Weaving and Lawrence Fishburne were right to give it a miss though what's left is a total mess.",4
258,"From a perspective of someone who just loves movies, this was bad. New characters shoehorned into weird sudo nostalgic roles, cringy editing and efffects, both rushed and slow at the same time, goes beyond meta to being annoying, nonsensical events that are both poorly shown and poorly explained. Adds nothing to the story of the matrix. Which is... ??? Like isn't that the point? Fights scenes were both long and boring and choreography was a mess. The acting was good nobody phoned it in but direction was bad, none got to shine, for what it represents for so many people it didn't comment at all on society, it was a laughable let down. That's objective- me personally?Hated the first 15 minutes, mostly really liked the next 30 or so and then it just devolved into a pathetic messy cash grab which it was apparently meant to be. And none of this even touches the cringy sjw unearned and cheesy story arc that trinity got. Basically it was another ""let's crap on that thing you love"" much like the new bond movie. 4/10 is for the 40ish minutes near the beginning we're it promised me a thoughtful commentary and new story right before it stopped caring.",4
259,"I'm sorry but Hollywood, can you just stop with these garbage reboots, sequels etc?I watched this as a four movie session with the first three. Why? Why did I do this? The first is classic, the next two are solid sequels and then I watched this...While not technically spoilers, I will say this, if you know anything about how modern movies are being written, you'll know everything about this film going in. Add a touch of Disney Star Wars, a smidgeon of Terminator Dark Fate, a drop of Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music and a big chunk of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and there you are.After I saw a human, high five a robot, I gave up and pretty much scrolled through my phone till the ""inevitable"" ending.",4
260,"There's nothing original anymore. No one can think for themselves because there's too many people telling them what they can or cannot say. It's completely destroying the entertainment industry (among other things) and nothing exemplifies that more than this movie.From ""Halloween Kills"" to ""The Many Saints of Newark,"" this joins the long list of the utterly horrible movies of 2021. If you are like me and actually saw ""The Matrix"" back in '99, then you were equally blown away by it. But here, unlike the original, there is absolutely no way you will like this garbage. No Laurence Fishburne, no Hugo Weaving, and a whole lotta square pegs being forced through round holes. It's not only BS - it's embarrassing. Has Hollywood actually forgotten how to make a good movie? Or, in the alternative, maybe they just aren't ""allowed"" to? Do they even give a damn? And why should they? Just add a little ""something-something"" and the political environment demands everyone pretend it's good. America is turning into a bunch of sheep, clones, and lemmings. Just look at some of the bogus reviews that are singing high praises! It's ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" all over again and it's scary as hell.Sorry, this sucked and so did 2021. Good riddance!",3
261,"Don't waste your time did not feel like a matrix film. Nothing good about this film, what a let down..none of coolness, action sequences were weak, only positive thing was to see Keanu reeves in the role.",1
262,"I love the original, this film is terminator all over again. They never made a decent film past 2.I'm sad now and want to cry my self to sleep.I think I'll pretend this movie never happened.",1
263,"If you're a ninetees and zeros sci-fi fan, you're probably having a tough time. In the past decade, Hollywood woke up and started to realise a lot of bad stuff in our society - our very own matrix - needed fixing. Unfortunately, they are not able to produce any decent sci-fi movie anymore.So women are stronger than men, LGBTQ and classic minority groups get the lead roles and white men need to be ridiculed. To which I say, no problem. As long as the story is convincing and the characters are memorable. The problem is that, imo, they are not.In this movie, I only (somewhat) cared about Neo, Trinity and Niobi as these characters are already established in the previous movies. I'm sorry to say that I can't reproduce any of the new character names 2h after seeing the movie. A (non?)binary 18 year old person is apparently the captain of a ship, but I just don't believe it for a second. Again, some of the greatest sci-fi captains are female (Janeway) or African American (Sisco), and I loved them. Not this one.The original Matrix storyline depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, which intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. Morpheus helps Neo to escape this virtual world and - over time - Neo becomes more powerful and eventually is able to defeat the Matrix with the help of Trinity and other memorable characters. Easy to follow, understand and enjoy.This movie shows that after ""minds"" were freed from the Matrix, the machine cities went to war over power shortages - but this is only shown in a 1 minute clip without any depth. Humans are allied to some sentient machines, which is understandable as some programs helped Neo in the previous movies, but there is no clip showing how this alliance was actually formed. Apparently, many minds did not choose to be unplugged and are still used as a main power source. Again, why this happened or why people choose to remain is unclear to me. Neo is plugged into the matrix and is again Thomas Anderson, Trinity is Tiffany. Apparently, this was done to give the psychiatrist (can't remember his name) more power to control the Matrix, but to what end? Neo and Trinity need to be ""freed"" but it's unclear to me why. Mankind established a new city called IO in which machines and freed minds live together in peace and make fruit.. there's no real urgency to start a new war as IO is not directly under siege or threatened by. Machines. Nevertheless, Neo and Trinity need to be freed so... They can love eachother? And Trinity needs to be able to fly instead of Neo because...me too?For a 45 year old (and yes, male and white) sci-fi fan, these are very confusing times...",3
264,Did the Wachowskis really write the original Matrix? Because this is what a vomit draft looks like. A stodgy and plodding replay of the first film with the most obvious ending imaginable. The opposite of an apotheosis. I hope everyone was paid well. The Matrix should be laid to rest now.,1
265,"Feels like 'Home Sweat Home Alone' or one of the 'Terminator' sequels.Feels like a cross over between 'John Wick' and 'Deadpool' with a cheap rip off sprinkle of Matrix dropped on top.Set design + character outfits + dialogues are all cheap and have no depth - feels like written by film students, or marketing people.Unfortunately only further damaged the franchise.Shame.",4
266,"This movie very much disappointed me. I did my best to keep it brief, so here it goes:First, the plot lacks originality and relies way too heavily on the past movies. They reused way too many lines and sequences from the first three movies, and I lost count of how many flashbacks were used as well.What else? Morpheus shouldn't have been re-casted. Niobe looks awful (apparently they were trying to make her look 60 years older). For some reason they brought back Smith (with a new human form), despite the fact that the Architect deleted Smith at the end of the last movie. And people are actually wearing COVID masks during one of the scenes. Seriously? Did COVID strike the Matrix, too?But worst of all, the movie fails to provide a true, emerging conflict. As humans and machines have finally learned to live together peacefully, there was no conflict until Neo was unplugged from the Matrix, so Neo was really unplugged for no reason. Why unplug him if peace has finally been achieved?",1
267,"Well.. the first 40 minutes were nothing but confusing and pointless. Random back and forth scenes, utilizing cut scenes from the previous films, making little or no sense. It felt like the film was taking FOREVER to get to any actual storyline! There seemed to be no actual plot anywhere. The viewer is left to try and make sense of bits and pieces... something about game development and ""The Matrix"" is a game??...I was REALLY having a hard time seeing any need to continue watching... then an actual plot does seem to emerge roughly 45-50 minutes into the film. However, that doesn't excuse the complete waste of time the opening hour is - all that could have been condensed into 15-20 minutes, anyway.......First let me say, if you hadn't seen the first three films, this film makes little or no sense. The first hour won't do ANYTHING to explain any previous storylines, what the Matrix is, who Mr Anderson is, who Morpheus is.. nothing. And after that, if you don't know the history from the first three films, the rest of the film seems unimportant and confusing in general. There's NO ACCESS for ""new"" viewers here.. you really MUST watch the first trilogy to understand... but then.. you'll see how pathetic this forth film is.The plot which develops.... meh... it's nothing more than a rehash with new actors trying to portray the same characters from past films. Note NOT new characters... new actors playing the SAME characters... new actor playing Morpheus, new actor playing Smith. And NPH's character is exceptionally ambiguous....All I can say is... they took a fairly well received franchise and tried to eek out that last few million from it with a storyline that didn't really fit the previous franchise and was seemingly just pulled out of thin air with no actual substance, compelling plot, or driving new characters. It's STILL the same story and all about Neo and Trinity... everyone else can go pound sand....Part of me can't help but think a better film could have been made with all new characters and an all new plot merely using the premise of the Matrix as the basis - rehashing the whole Neo/Trinity thing was largely pointless. It kind of felt like the plot from Matrix 3 reworked.The most ludicrous part of this film.. the ORIGINAL film used a new camera technique which was later coined ""bullet time"". It had NOTHING to do with the script, the characters, the matrix, etc.. it was about the ground-breaking cinematography used. It was about HOW scenes were filmed.. not some super-human ability characters had. But in this film.. it's referred to by name and is actually a thing used by character. So, they've taken something COMPLETELY unrelated to the storyline and made it part of the script??? Silly.Watch to finish the franchise, but don't be too disappointed when you realize this film is a waste of time. There's NOTHING new in it.. same CGI as previous films.. same characters... same action sequences... same general storyline... it's the same... with a MUCH weaker script overall.",4
268,"No need for this movie, offers nothing new or different. They should have ended the series after the 2nd film. The 3rd film was horrendous and this is worse. Acting is straight to dvd standard, no suspense, shock or anything good. Fighting is zzzzzz. Nice pay check for the actors but speed 2 would have been a better choice for Keanu here.",3
269,"I went into the movie heaps excited as Matrix 1 was a classic.Oh man I'm speechless on how bad the movie was.Horrible fight speech, poor special effects and horrible horrible story.So bad I stop watching half way or was it 3/4 of the way. Who cares.Lana should never direct again.",1
270,"One third of this movie had a comedic tone to it. It might have been called the Great Gatsby with flamboyant people and flashy colors and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. You take the green tint and depressing colors from the Matrix and fill it with scenes full of sunshine, and you're left with a movie that does not deserve to be called the Matrix. And your excuse is what? That it's a ""new version"" of the Matrix? Don't tell me the characters would've been able to tell the difference between reality and a simulation if the machines had used the same greenish colors all over again, because they couldn't have told the difference.Neo looked old. Trinity had a lot of wrinkles and was no longer attractive. Therefore, I could care less if two oldies reunited or not. Nairobi looked plain awful. The oracle was not there. Agent Smith totally lacked his menacing appearance and tone of voice. He was sarcastic and looked like a character straight out of a comedy film. Movie studios have the technology to recreate characters that can no longer act, like what they did to Paul Walker in Fast and Furious after his death. They could've done that with Morpheus and Agent Smith as well; the two most iconic characters in the Matrix. The new characters didn't have that Matrix feel to them. The special effects didn't look half as impressive as they did in the first three movies. I did not enjoy this movie at all. This was a cash-grab and I hope movie studios would just leave iconic movies alone. I'm going to pretend as if this movie never existed. The Matrix is a great, and as this pathetic excuse for a movie proved, an unrepeatable ""trilogy"".",3
271,"Let me start this by saying that I genuinely wanted to love this movie. Or even just to like it quite a bit.Because I loved The Matrix, really like Reloaded and will even happily sit through Revolutions, even though it gets a lot of hate.But Resurrection is objectively bad. And in so many ways.Let's start with the audio first - this varies between absolutely deafening and impossible to hear dialogue.Then we had the worst possible enactment of the above with Jessica Henwick mumbling her dialogue through a barely-open mouth. That was obviously meant to look and sound edgy or intense but it meant that I missed entire chunks of dialogue because she whispered her way through it.Swapping out Morpheus and Smith was possibly necessary but the choice of actors was bad. Morpheus felt like a fan fiction actor and Smith. Just no. Hugo Weaving can convey malice with a raised eyebrow, so Groff was just way out of his depth here.And who in the name of God decided Doogie Howser had the chops to be the next Architect?The incessant humour and wisecracks - once every ""beat"" is too much. Way too much. About 5% of the gags landed. Everything else was forced.The fight scene with Morpheus wearing a kimono...that's one of the worst things I've ever seen. NO martial artist fights wearing a kimono - that's a what a do-gi is designed for. So a martial artist stepping up to me in a kimono is going to get it pulled over his head the first time I grapple him and then get choked out with his own clothing.So this was obviously to make him look fabulous or something but it didn't land well. In fact, it looked ridiculous.The other fight scenes? Meh.1. They went for volume - set pieces with dozens of people fighting at once. So you couldn't really see any single person fighting because of all the quick cuts.2. Not one single fight was even remotely as entertaining or well choreographed as anything in the previous Matrix movies, including Revolutions. So that gives you an idea of what you're dealing with.3. Remember the tension where Neo fought Smith in The Matrix? Yeah, you're not going to see anything like that.The plot.What plot?This was a cash grab. The lead actors walked through it looking like it was a contractual obligation and not a movie they actually wanted to make.There was ZERO gravitas onscreen. None. It felt flat. It looked flat.There were so many characters we could have explored in more detail but we got faces thrown in for fan service, and flashbacks to distract you from the fact you're watching a terrible movie.The plot was an inconsequence but it does prove one thing.The Wachowskis actually have very limited talent in relation to storytelling. And that comes from somebody who loves Cloud Atlas. But they didn't write Cloud Atlas.So the only thing of actual merit the Wachowskis have ever produced is the first Matrix movie.Everything else has flopped.I'm really hoping that Resurrections is their last movie. Ever.",2
272,It's like they scoured fan fiction sites for the absolute worst Matrix fanfic they could find and made that. The story and dialogue are just utter drivel and there arent even good action scenes to make up for that. Truly awful.,1
273,"I didn't believe, or didn't want to believe my friends but The Matrix Resurrections is just terrible bad. Really bad. Almost a travesty, a money grabber produced without any single drop of creativity and soul into the mix. The worst movie Wachowski directed to the day - boring to the core, and I should not forget to add: the visual quality and production value looks rather cheap and is way inferior compared to the original trilogy.",1
274,"This movie screamed weak fan fiction penned by a pack of excitable teenage sci-fi geeks. It had not one shred of originality. It was 1/2 regurgitation of past Matrices and 1/2 standard Hollywood cliche.This review contains no spoilers because there is nothing to spoil. What is the plot? I don't know. What was the point of this movie? Shameless cash grab.This is no comedy, but I heard some snorts and disbelieving laughs in the theater. I felt like I was watching a high school film project. I was texting on my phone for significant chunks of this movie and left to return a call. I can't believe I paid to watch such utter garbage.",1
275,"I was both excited and sceptical when the news broke that Matrix 4 was in the works. I refrained from reading about it, watching the trailers and reading the reviews but it was impossible to keep it a total surprise, and I was reluctant to watch it in the end to be honest.I've now seen it and it left me with the questions why was it made, and for whom?I usually do a detailed review about the movie and go into actors, footage etc but in this case I'm going to focus on these two questions and that's all.My theory is that people have been asking the Wachowskis again and again and again and again if and when they'll do a follow up to the Matrix trilogy?The only answer to the first question is that Lana Wachowski got fed up by these questions and made a really whacked fourth instalment that would stop anyone from ever asking the same question again - thus answering the second question that the movie was made for all those who's been bothering them about Matrix in an attempt to once and for all stop the nagging!I can't fathom any other reason for making The Matrix Resurrections. I just can't.There are some good scenes in the movie but they don't outweigh the bad ones, and the script is frankly rather terrible. That's my honest answer, which is a shame because Lana and her sister have written some genius stuff prior to this...If you are a true fan of the Matrix saga then I'd stay well away from this one. It's a bit like Highlander 2 and how it almost ruined the first one by what they did and said in the sequel...It feels odd to have Keanu Reeves in a bad movie, and Carrie-Anne Moss certainly deserved better, but here we are. Actors needs to be paid as much as anyone does and I hope they got a fat paycheck for putting their names and faces in this one!",5
276,"Hardcore fans of the lore &amp; the original series will probably lap this right up, and are happy with seemingly hours of exposition through verbal rather than visual means.Unlike the first film, which was fast-paced, exciting, new and mind-bending, this is basically a retread with minor tweaks, adjustments &amp; updates. The average viewer may struggle to stay awake through endless talking and backstory, kind of like reading the opening text of a Star Wars film, but for half the movie.",4
277,"Oh no Lana Lana Lana... what did you do?! You thought you could just show up in your brother's footsteps?I knew from the first scene this was going to be a very, very bad movie. I watched tons of movies so I usually don't need more than a minute in to know. I did watch until the end, ignoring all the bad action scenes and stupid boring dialogues and sleepy acting.Also I would like to say about the direction of this movie that there are things women can do very well, just like there are things they can't and absolutely should not. The same applies to men. That's just the way it is and I wish women started understanding that. Feminism is all good, but being stubborn about proving something futile is not.",1
278,"The movie is a bit ironic in that it pretends to be self aware and a bit arrogant in that it thinks it's a meta commentary on a trend it apparently considers itself above while unironically cashing in on that very thing: nostalgia, brand recognition and cash grabs. The original film was amazing while the second and third demonstrated a lack of depth in the ability to tell a story or explore new worlds in any meaningful way. This fourth installment seems more like a temper tantrum than a failure, though it certainly is that. An excellent way to view the matrix series for those who love the original is as a singular entry. 2, 3 and whatever this is need not apply.",3
279,"This is classless contrived garbage. Whoever imagined that this would be anything less than rubbish is a fool there is nothing new or original here , There is nothing to recommend this at all had a few viewing disappointments this year but this is the worst are there no original ideas left ??

280,"It seemed like they did their best to make sure all the bad guys were white men of course because agenda politics, but also to make sure that the new squad of people were even more snowflake than before. While this wouldn't be a problem if done right, they were all shallow people. They even made sure the white male bad guy used trigger words like ""controlling women"".They had some decent story in there but it was otherwise destroyed by agenda politics and shallow characters. This is just a reboot, a remake, in the new age of snowflakes and percentage based equality. Nothing about it is worth watching.I liked the premise of rogue machines working with the humans, would have been fun. It was nice to see some of the new effects and one new power in the bad guy side, but eh. I won't be watching the 5th movie if they make it. In fact I plan to pretend there was never a 4th at all, to preserve the memory of the originals.",3
281,Started off decently then just felt like a bunch of random fighting scenes combined with no real plot. It's the first film I've seen in awhile where I really wanted to leave the cinema.I'd give this one a miss if I were you.,2
282,"I feel sorry for myself for watching it even half way throughThere's no reason and logical matter in this title that i don't know to call it a matrix movie or not ! 100% they ruined the whole trilogy and even lana say it in the movie , she just spit to the matrix with this movie , i couldn't watch it because every ten minutes they've show scenes from previous matrix movies and when you see that and compare it to this new matrix you get nausea.There's no point to make sequel first when i was found out that there might be a sequel to matrix in the first place i got excited and all of a sudden i'd got nervous. I was telling to myself that if they realy mess this up they're gonna destroy matrix just for money and dumb bussinesses.This is i worry about , a pointless fight between characters that i don't really know , that just keep say OG matrix lines from previous movies and a john wick tries to be neo . Ridiculous and meaningless .There's also a freaking huge plot whole , french man , new agent smith 😁 all of them knew that he was neo but they were working with him until he got back to io ( new zion) and suddenly they want him to be dead isn't it a clown script ? I mean even a 9 year old kid could write a script better than that .Everything in resurrection is a dull and painfully pointless and meaningless.2/10 for ruining our great memory from matrix neo and morphious.",2
283,"Congrats to the Wachowskis. You took the genius of Baudrillard and a zillion dollars, and still managed to make a dog heap of films under The Matrix banner. Baudrillard gave you the first film. An amateur, with the amount of money you were given for the first film, could have made it a success. Audiences were intrigued by the idea. Baudrillard's idea. Your work is seen in the sequels with this film taking the prize of most useless. It feels like an arts undergraduate trying to be clever and covering up a lack of intelligence, and worse, talent, with a blanket of money. No amount of studio trolls on IMDB is going to change this wrecking mess of a film(and series).",1
284,"Another female empowerment vehicle . I Can't believe I paid top dollar to watch this film . Shouldn't have bothered , no longer a wachowski fan .would of only rated it one star , but I gave Keanu the other Three , he did his best with the rot he had to work with.",2
285,Is this the Hollywood within the Hollywood? Anyway there is no story here or progression of anything kind its a lower budget retread of the first 3 movies and done in a kind of joking way weird? Anyway you'll see.,2
286,"As a movie on its own merits it was terrible.As the fourth installment of a series it was even worse than ""Revolutions"".For a long part of the movie it was trying to be like ""Scream"" - a fourth-wall breaking parody of itself. For the rest of the movie it was both cringe worthy and sad. Something old and worn out trying to be cool and young again, like a Hawaiian shirt wearing old man with Piña colada in hand dancing toward his daughter's friend.There really needs to be a great Revolution of Cinema. ASAP. The Matrix should have ended with ""Reloaded"". Terminator should have ended after ""T2"". Etc. And no more rebooting of classic 70s or 80s or 90s movies. Remaking in a new different interesting way and/or with its own name still has its place. But for the longest time true artistic vision, iconic directors, genius/gifted screenwriters, have steadily become rarer and rarer. Replaced with music video directors, video game CGI, and cowardly or uncreative writers.No wonder the movie industry is falling further behind the video game industry...even tho that too is starting to reach that same kind of critical mass.Hollywood is so out of touch, and the future ain't bright. A huge shake up is needed. A return to the free-wheeling ribald imagination and story-telling and delightful acting.",1
287,"Firstly, this movie needed Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith...very badly. But overall, the plot was not great. The initial premise was good, but it got convoluted and confusing. The main antagonist really wasn't strong enough for the story.Visually it was great, but half way through it jsut seemed to pile on the action sequences to keep it afloat, and the Matrix movies are more than that.Jessica Henwick, carrie ann moss and reaves were pretty good. Neil Patrick Harris really seemed to be in the wrong role, and Jonathan Groff in no way had the depth of Hugo Weavings Mr Smith. Lambert Wilson was ridiculous.Overall, a sad way to end the series.",5
288,"Basically the story of the Matrix ended by 3rd installment however this saga remains the most relevant one for promoting for virtual realities which is getting all the hype at the moment so they had to unseal that coffin .Despite it kept people dazzled of what exactly are they seeing let me briefly explain :They had to instate the Matrix is still running for the open world game take over from thereThey had to introduce the concept of Bots (NPCs) for that the morality of killing real people trapped inside a virtual reality is always bad but killing bots is ok for game playThey increased the number of villains so you are no longer being haunted by two or three agents manifesting the bodies of others but a whole horde of villains you can get kill frenzy atTrinity gets super powers too as the main lead of the game is a female mind you they wanted to instate that its not a man's world any more for the open world multiplayer to attract females as wellBut here is what they actually throw at you watching this movie :Very incoherent storyThe idea of the enormous fire power the Bots shoot at Neo's gang gets you pissed at how they all miss , judging that they are being fired by a governing AI that powerful and supposedly mathematically accurateThere is no green anymore , they removed the green filter or made it lite , I am not sure but that alone made it feel less related to the MatrixThe new AI running the Matrix is so powerful yet he keeps sparing Neo just for the story to continueTrinity gets to have more powers than Neo for the new wave of girls power movies despite her being out of the loop for so long mind you no valid explanation is given for that particular detailNo character development what so ever with Neo's gang , they are just faces you see shooting around where they sometimes even change those faces and introduce new ones without explanation (Maybe that cast you remember had a day off that day)",1
289,"What can I say? If you don't have lots of time on your hands and you're looking for a movie to watch, just give this one a hard pass. If you don't know what to do with your free time, do the same.The story is a meaningless piece of manure, the acting is subpar and the action is below the freezing point.",1
290,"SPOILERS:At one point in the film Neo/Keanu is asked to reboot a video game franchise, which we find out is Matrix 1-3. He is told if he does not reboot it he will lose his contract with Warner Brothers. Yep. Seems Lana was about to lose her contract with Warner Brothers and was forced to reboot the Matrix to keep her contract.My prediction it will make its money overseas and we will get sequels of the reboot.Likewise, and like the Star Wars sequels (moreso episode 7), this is just a remake of the original. Fairly close to part for part.Matrix part 1 was great.Then every movie for years after copied bullet time and was played out.Reloaded and Revolutions tried to create scripts based on philosophy &amp; metaphysics for dummies. Cleaver if you were a freshman in college, otherwise it was boring, made you roll your eyes, and not care about the action at all.Honestly the battle of Zion in Revolutions I don't know a single person who gave a crap.I'll go further, Matrix 1 was so original Lana and company made a career on its success. Then stumbled the anti-consumer messages in Speed Racer (horribly unwatchable) and Cloud Atlas, which I still can't get through and gave up trying.I was however excited for Matrix Resurrections. Though iPhones, and social media would be a profound part of it. Instead it was silly self referential nonsense that was proud at how un-clever it was. Proof that the film knows it's previous faults? No reference to Reloaded and Revolutions.Oh.... Big spoiler... the part that made me vomit. The franchise went from philosophy to Neo's and Trinity's love gives them power. This negates everything from the previous films. The matrix and Zion are all the same thing. The revolutions is programmed. That's why Neo has powers in Zion, and what the architect said in one of the sequels. It was stupid then. It's stupid now. Love power is stupid too.Create a myth. A great idea for one film and walk away. Why rehash a lack of story for parts 2-4.Ugh.Episode one was better than this tripe, and episode one sucked.Oh, but back to my point. Lana wanted to keep her Warner Brothers contract so this was made.The End.",1
291,This movie is such a convoluted mess I even don't know what to say about the script.In general it has strong woke message (if you into that stuff). At the moment I was asking myself if they are even promoting some communist-socialists ideas in this movie. Very weird.It's completely different from the original tribology and if you liked those movies you will most like hate this one.I wish I waited to see this one on BR or just watch or read some reviews.If you are die hard fan of M1-3 you will be shocked to see what they did in this one.Complete disappointment.,1
292,"This movie is beyond badly made. It feels like written by middle schoolers and acted by high school drama wannabees.The fact that every AI needs to stop and explain who they are and why are they doing it before starting to smack down or in the middle of it. Is really kindergarten level.Time to retire not just Matrix but Lana, Sense8 season two was a disaster as well.",3
293,"For this review would you prefer to take the red pill or the blue pill?If you choose blue you can carry on living under the premise that the Matrix franchise is still fine and 'Resurrections' a worthwhile endeavor for anyone with a couple of hours to spare.If you choose red then the truth shall be revealed and you will understand that the 'choice' to make a 4th installment, whether freewill or destiny, was a terrible one that lessens the legacy of the trilogy.It's a bit like watching an aging footballer well past their prime go to the Chinese league for a big payday - there are reminders of what you used to love about them, but ultimately its a move based on cash rather than for fans.With few pleasant exceptions, the script is dire and the protagonists seem to be constantly trying to explain and justify their actions. A good deal of the movie is lifted scenes from previous films which continually serve as a reminder as to how far they have fallen from the first genuinely ground breaking movie.Major character actors have been replaced but not improved, and the overall feeling that I and apparently many in the cinema I visited was 'After almost 20 years why was this necessary?'.The red pill answer to this question is it absolutely wasn't, and I can only hope that those directly involved don't decide to diminish the early movies further.",2
294,The only thing that could have made this even worse than it was is if they'd cast john boyega as morphius!Most of the script was explaining the naff 'plot' while basically dining off the original. The usual pointless woke casting didn't help things either.All this movie does is taint the original. Don't even watch it out of morbid curiosity. It was torturous.Now need to watch the first one again just to try to erase this one from memory!,1
295,It's nothing but a love letter to the original and Neo and Trinity's relationship. The whole movie is spent reminiscing about it. Take a step back from it and ask yourself what was the plot here other than that? It's completely pointless.,4
296,"As Miss Jean Brodie once observed, 'for those who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they like' and enough people liked the original ""The Matrix"" to turn it into a trilogy. ""The Matrix"" movies were technical marvels full of gobbledygook and it hardly mattered that they didn't make much sense but strung together they added up to almost seven hours of screen time and that's an awful lot of gobbledygook and time spent inside what is basically a computer game. After the third ""Matrix"" film the Wachowskis decided to call it a day, wisely I thought, so why now 'the Resurrections'? Don't filmmakers know when to leave well enough alone?Anyone coming fresh to ""The Matrix Resurrections"" won't have a clue what's going on and even if you've been here before you still won't have a clue what's going on. These are movies for gaming nerds and computer geeks who can't tell pretentious bull from real life, (btw, I think I just cracked a Matrix joke!), so now Lana Wachowski has come up with the idea of making a self-reverential sequel to the trilogy that tells us we're watching a Warner Brothers sequel to the trilogy and she's 'resurrected' Keanu Reeves, (you know, the actor with the personality of artificial intelligence minus the intelligence), as Thomas Anderson aka Neo and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity while Morpheus is now a lot younger and sexier than Laurence Fishburne ever was.On a technical and visual level this movie is still a marvel but sadly it takes itself very seriously when it's really a spoof, or should be, of the earlier Matrix movies. Come to think of it, the second and third Matrix movies should have been spoofs of the original rather than sequels while Reeves cements his reputation as the world's worst actor. On the plus side there's Jonathan Groff and Neil Patrick Harris as the bad guys and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is excellent as the new Morpheus. Reeves spends a good deal of time saying 'this can't be happening'; unfortunately it is, on a screen near you. I have a feeling even nerds are going to be disappointed this time round.",4
297,"The first hour just drags. Lots of therapy, pill popping and Keanu moping around. If you like that Doogie Howser guy I guess maybe you can see the humor. I didn't.I guess the gimmick is that Keanu Reeves is back to being Thomas Andersen, working at a game company where they've apparently, in a cheesy self-aware sort of way, made a trio of Matrix video games.Thomas Anderson eventually meets with scrappy band of rebels, including a new Morpheus, who bring him through and it's the first Matrix all over again.It's just not very clear why it's all happening again. There's a new machine war or something?Neo, back in the real world again, just wants Trinity freed from the Matrix. Why? Don't really know.They go back in, there's a fight with the new Agent Smith. It's all a big mess and hard to follow. Neo is sort of where he was before, just older.Neo's powers just seem to be mostly invisible force shields and projection, with less focus on the kungfu.I read that Yuen Woo-ping wasn't part of this and it shows The fights are muddier. Not as clean and fluid as before.Also missing the Don David score, those weird glissandos and so on.This just didn't feal as clean and neatly constructed.The ending reveal was just pure cringe. I mean, it was a pause the film, close your eyes, shake your head moment.Skip this one. It's not worth checking out.",1
298,"If the original movie didn't exist this would probably have been a decent movie and my rating would be higher maybe a 7 or so but not higher than that. Problem is that the original does exist and then you see how bad this movie is.The vibe is all off. The original was dark and suffocated you with the suspense but this doesn't do that not in the slightest. They went for the special effects and witty remarks. I mean fist bumping a robot? Or Neil Patrick Harris's character being all witty. In the original movies the antagonists were really intimidating characters Neil's is not.And I guess we needed a new Matrix to poor some wokeness on to it. The 'oh look women in power' didn't go unnoticed. Female general, female scientist, female captain, female with the plan to save humanity and all of a sudden the One needs to be female too. And the cherry on top was he outrosong it was the female version of Rage against the machine. Great. And let's not act that we don't know why NPH was cast for the role of Analyst. Because for the role he was really miscast. Don't get me wrong I like him as an actor but just not for that role.The fight scenes were a joke compared to the original movies. And why did they have to do Morpheus like that? They made a mockery out of his character.Anyway. It's just isn't it.",4
299,As a big fan of the original trilogy I was so looking forward to this. But oh my what a mess of a storyline and film. I wanted to stop watching after about half an hour but for sentimental reasons watched till the end. Garbage and what a disappointment.,1
300,"Huge Matrix fan here.The beginning of the movie had a huge cheap spin off feel and let me down immediately. Especially the cinematography. I couldnt help to think this whole script was written over night after so many years. The ""choice"", coincidentally funny to say, to use love as a premise for this last chapter, hopefully, was absolutely horrible. This choice ultimately lead to many scenes destroying what the whole matrix storyline was all about...that this was bigger than neo/trinity. As the Analyst said, ""what a mess.""As for the script itself, the style of introducing old characters played such a trivial role it was absolutely unnecessary and felt it was done to create some sad attempt of nostalgia. Act 3 made me bury this franchise in hopes to never see it revived again.A for effort, F for actually following through.",3
301,"The actresses and actors are the only thing that are good about the movie. They did an excellent job with a garbage script. The visuals are somehow ""less perfect"" than the original trilogy ones. The music is definitively not on point. A shame, because it was some of the elements that allow us the immersive experience of the original movie.But the script... oh my, oh my. The script is an abomination: filled with ill-inspired humor, making fun of its own concept and universe, portraits a disoriented hero, as confused as the audience, going along a story you cannot care less about. You can almost feel the total disregard for the fandom, the franchise, the series and its original material.Its disheartening to watch Hollywood destroying its movie franchises this way. This is another ""lastjedization"" of a saga, and a shame in that regard.Do not waste your money or your time in this. Better watch again the original and forget this monster exists.",1
302,"I had high hopes for this movie but what I ended up seeing was a case of the trailer is better than the movie.The storyline lacked strength and character building, the effects were awful and the inclusion of 'friendly robots' was a terrible idea. Just their presence felt like a Pokémon product placement.Overall, there was no philosophical debates, discourse or narrative cultivation, no green or blue tints between the matrix and real worlds and there was a lack of intensity and anticipation. Overall, you will be paying to watch a film that feels like it was made by Netflix (which isn't good, as they give the go-ahead to anything they're pitched). It feels like it was made for the lowest common denominator in order to please everyone, but ended up pleasing no one.This feels like a straight to DVD fan film.Addendum - you've probably heard about the 'action' scenes? There aren't many and they're in no way on the scale of the prior movies.",1
303,"This movie is bad on purpose, but still there is no middle ground to decide if it is enjoyable or not.The intentions of the director are clear, she is fed up with the Hollywood studios continuing to make unnecessary remakes and sequels of films that were successful in their time, because of this, the film cannot have a middle ground, it is crap or it is tremendous genius. And in this case it is the first one, by delivering to the audience a soulless and loveless product made only to sell more, something that does not stand out and that made Warner lose millions of dollars, and exhibiting its studio mediocrity by only releasing remakes poorly done and without love. The film is full of conveniences, inconsistencies, boring parts, zero depth in the plot and no development of what is happening. It has bad action scenes, bad special effects, terrible sound, bad music, terrible editing, not much character development, forced humor, poorly depth in the characters, situations that come out of nowhere and disappear in the same way and a very absurd way of resolving conflicts, basically everything that Hollywood unnecessary remakes and sequels have.The director's intentions are clear, and she manages to show Warner's mediocrity, but still I don't think it's fair to give the audience that loves the first films so much a product like this, without soul and made without love, and spend their money and their time to see this product that offers nothing new and that completely ruins the main trilogy, it's a shame that the studio approved this project, hopefully Warner learns from their mistakes and does not continue to make this kind of sequels and remakes totally unnecessary.",1
304,"The original movie will always be the most superlative, the second Reloaded had some memorable sequences, and the third Revolutions was okay, and now, 18 years on, there came this reboot fourth instalment in the franchise, written, produced, and directed by Lana Wachowski (Bound, Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas). Basically, within the Matrix, Bugs (Jessica Henwick), the captain of the Mnemosyne, encounters a program running old code of when Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) was searching for Neo (Keanu Reeves) before being found by Agents. Bugs finds one of the agents behaving strangely, and discovers he is Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) trapped back in the system and helps to free him. In the city, Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a successful game developer, having created a trilogy of games based on his dreams the Matrix. He developed the trilogy with the help of his business partner Smith (Jonathan Groff) but has trouble separating dreams from reality. He is meeting with a therapist (Neil Patrick Harris), who provides him with blue pills to help keep his sanity. One day, he goes to a coffee shop and encounters a married mother named Tiffany, who reminds him of the woman in his visions, and decides to stop taking his pills. Outside the Matrix, Bugs and Morpheus discover Neo's signal within the Matrix, despite the belief he was dead. They connect Neo to Anderson and realise he had been unconsciously running a networking node to help them to find Morpheus. Bugs and her allies enter the Matrix to help locate Neo's body in the real world, and discover that Smith is Agent Smith, who has been watching Anderson. Bugs helps Anderson to elude Smith and his new ability to take control over numerous individuals within the Matrix. Bugs and Morpheus explain to Anderson what the Matrix is, and with a decreased perception of what is real and what is not real, he agrees to be extracted. Neo wakes up in a pod, finding the body of Trinity contained nearby, but machine entities, loyal to Bugs, recover him before he can free her. He is taken to the Mnemosyne and to the new human sanctuary of Io, where he is reintroduced to an elderly Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). It has been sixty years since the end of the Machine War, and the human survivors have allied with the machines to keep the system working against an Anomaly within it. Niobe takes Neo to meet Sati (Priyanka Chopra Jonas), an exile program he previously met as a child in the Matrix subway station Mobil Ave, she explains that the Anomaly was created after the Machine War and had somehow resurrected Neo and Trinity and kept them isolated from others. Though Neo wants to rescue Trinity, Sati warns that doing so could have consequences. Niobe orders Neo to remain outside the Matrix, but Bugs and others go against her orders and agree to help him try to free Trinity. Coordinating activities in and outside the Matrix, Neo and Bugs enter the Matrix but are met by Smith and other exile programs would want to see the Matrix returned to its former self. While Bugs and her crew fight the Exiles, Neo goes against Smith, slowly recalling his previous abilities to bend the rules of reality within the Matrix. With Smith defeated, Neo goes to Tiffany's repair shop, but before he can talk to her, his therapist appears and slows down time. The therapist reveals himself to be the Analyst, a program that studies the human psyche but has since grown more powerful. He previously watched Neo and Trinity die at the end of the Machine War but created the resurrection pods to continue studying them. Over countless iterations, he found that individually, the two were not special, but working together they overpowered the system. Therefore, the Analyst has been controlling the latest iteration of the Matrix and tried to prevent them from meeting and becoming close. This has what has caused the Anomaly to be destabilised, the machines have prepared to reboot the Matrix again, but the Analyst has placed that on hold. He threatens to kill Trinity if Neo does not return to be reinserted in his pod. Neo and Bugs are forced to leave the Matrix when the Mnemosyne is being brought back to Io. Neo pleads with Niobe to allow him to return to the Matrix to try and free Trinity, and she eventually agrees. Back in the Matrix, Neo makes a deal with the Analyst; he will return to his pod if he fails to convince Trinity to become aware of her own past and the Matrix. Trinity, as Tiffany, is brought to them and enticed to stay by the appearance of her family. She initially seems to want to go with them but realises what is reality and recognises her true self as Trinity. The Analyst is about to kill them when Smith interferes, seeking revenge for his own imprisonment, and gives Neo, Trinity, and the others time to escape. Bugs and the others extract themselves, but the Analyst traps Neo and Trinity at the top of a skyscraper swarmed by a group of controlled humans. With nowhere else to go, they hold hands and jump off the building, with Neo expecting to fly them away. Instead, Trinity gains the ability and flies them to safety, and the two escape and regain control of the Matrix. In the aftermath, Neo and Trinity return to face the Analyst, assuring him that he will face consequences should he attempt to seize control of the Matrix again. Neo and Trinity both fly away to redesign the Matrix. Also starring Christina Ricci as Gwyn de Vere, Toby Onwumere as Sequoia, Max Riemelt as Sheperd, Brian J. Smith as Berg, Eréndira Ibarra as Lexy, Lambert Wilson as The Merovingian, and Chad Stahelski as Chad, Trinity's husband. Reeves is alright as the former saviour of humanity trapped back in the Matrix, Moss is not on as much but is fine, Abdul-Mateen II should have been onscreen much longer as the replacement for Laurence Fishburne, Groff is not as memorable as the replacement for Hugo Weaving, and Harris is not bad as the new villain. It should be noted, Reeves has a beard in the Matrix, and no beard in the real world, so that's easy to differentiate, and the characters leave the Matrix via mirrors, not telephone calls like previously, this is obviously a reference to Alice Through the Looking Glass. The first half of the film is filled with deliberate references to the previous three films, some clever some daft, and the second half is when the pace increases with fights and chases. The story has some good ideas with returning themes of fate, the Alice in Wonderland ""white rabbit"" scenario, theology and all that stuff, and the special effects are fantastic. But, as with the predeceasing sequels, it is just repeating what made the first film cool, and it just can't equal or better it, but at least it is not a boring reboot, a relatively interesting and worthwhile enough science-fiction action. Okay!",4
305,"I didn't get that far. As soon as they were showing that the first 3 movies were video games created by Keanu, i started to lose interest. It seemed to me that they were negating the first 3 movies. Then when Keanu and Trinity didn't know each other, i was out of there.So The Matrix - i have watched many, many times. 2nd and 3rd - i watched once each. #4 - i didn't finish. Maybe someone will convince me to finish it.",4
306,"The whole matrix trilogy is how trinity helps discover neo matrix, but here, she is just wasted(besides the bike chase)and the movie feels boring, feels slow, feels like a bad indie movie.but here everyone look like bored or annoyed, even the new bad guy and neil patrick feel like they are here just to talk.the first 3 were action movies with sci-fi. This feels like a slow sci-fi movie and boring.and neo now is john wick...",1
307,"The first Matrix is my favourite movie of all time.This movie is like the Cecilia Giménez 19th-century Spanish fresco restoration.Hollywood has this new negative trend, of taking whatever happened in earlier movies and trying to write it off as meaningless, or it meant nothing, but look at me now! Are we not great!Ugh.Also Hollywood, please please invest in better writers, take some of the money from CGI and put it towards hiring better writers.At least I can always re-watch the first movie.",2
308,"If this had been the first there would never have been a second. It seems its the run of the mill these days, add a sequil to a popular movie add put no thought into it. Epic let down across the board. Worth watching to compare to original but be prepared to be disappointed.",5
309,"Just when I thought they couldn't make a worse sequel than part 3.The Matrix was a movie based on that feeling 'is this all real? Am I just a lab rat in puzzle somewhere?' A Truly a brilliant idea, superb plot excellently excuted with groundbreaking visual effects. You walked out of the Theatre simply going...""wow"".The following two sequels were, well, basically a confusing mess...much like the dialogue by the architect. Most were left disappointed and wondered if they could be redone. Too late now.Part 4 was an opportunity of a sort of reboot, which, they utterly failed to take. Reboots can work. Ask your friendly neighbourhood Spider-man. However, there must be around 20% of old footage used in this film, why? Is anyone going to see this without seeing the previous 3 films? Must they ram down your throats what happened in the previous movies so much? It started to get really, really annoying after a while.The plot, to it's credit, is much simpler to understand but is just trash. They should have taken this to a completely new direction. Instead, they just shoehorned in as many repeats of original ideas as possible.But hey..it worked...it made me pay £ for a ticket and waste 2 hours of my life. This will not be bought on blu ray/uhd by this fan of the original. It doesn't add anything to anything and I have no desire to repeat watch at all.2 stars as some of the effects and some good casting were well executed BUT nothing you hadn't really seen in the originals.",2
310,"Well, as the 10 minutes went by...oddly i became angry. The blue haired woman...i could not understand a word she said...mumbles. I wanted to enjoy this as much as the first Matrix. But, after the last season of GOT i am not willing to watch CRAP films/tv series.After the 2nd and 3rd Matrix, I lost trust in the showrunners. They are now HACKS instead of GENIUS.Soin 10 minutes i hated the camera work, colorization, acting, editing and special effects. A hollow reboot. It's Christmas so i will end this now...i have interesting things to do today.",1
311,"It's funny that the grandson of the architect calls the Matrix a regurgitation, because that was my thought exactly. Unlike Ghostbusters Afterlife, a blend of nostalgia with a respectable continuation of the first film, Resurrection delivers terrible plot holes, loads of CGI that doesn't compliment the limited practical effects, and the Rocky sequels peppering of flashback footage does not redeem this terrible film.There is a message in the film, and that is the only reason I give 1 star at all, even if zero was available. This film did to the originals what Terminator Genisys did to the it's franchise. It's a blatant reboot but horribly executed, there's no need to watch this, and even less of a reason for it to have been made in the first place.Please, Wachowski, STOP making films.",1
312,"There are moments in this movie where the acting is so bad that it.has a quality strangely reminiscent of The Room. This is mostly on Keanu Reeves who, well, can't act at all and.has an extremely limited.range that.was pushed in this movie past the point that it can handle.The best parts of this movie are comedic, intended or otherwise. Not nearly enough to make it a so-bad-its-good as the.filmmaking is competent, just really uninteresting. The action is extremely dated by today's standards (just look at a show like Gangs of London if you want action that blows you away) and the visuals aren't unique or even reminiscent of the first movie, you might as well be watching some MARVEL movie or any mainstream blockbuster.But I guess the worst part is that this movie feels somewhere between totally unnecessary and uninteresting and like an inside joke on the part of Wachowski.But do I think it ruined the Matrix or something? Not really. It's hard to watch this movie and really think of it as being connected to the original trilogy.",4
313,"I LOVED(!!!!!) the original Matrix film. It was intelligent, beautifully filmed, and the action sequences were ahead of their time. The sequels weren't nearly as good but its hard to catch lightning in a bottle three times in a row.This ""film"" looks more like someone used their iPhone 13, pulled a TikTok with Keanu and Carrie, and literally recast and reshot the original film with the dumbest plots possible. They (I kid you not) had scenes of the first Matrix movie PROJECTED onto bedsheets(?!?!?) when they met Neo like it was some weekend garage band party. I did that stuff at my kids' birthday parties in the late-'90s. This is supposed to be centuries in the future???Like Keanu for much of this film, I was so seriously confused halfway through who was whom (Morpheus wasn't Fishburne, Weaving wasn't Smith but his NAME had a new UNintimidating fratboy in jeans and t-shirt playing the iconic role, the Oracle ain't around no more, the machines are our FRIENDS???, they don't need phones anymore to transport because there are mirrors everywhere (OMG...), Neo's buddies kickbox sentients scene after bloodless scene but nobody dies -- or is even bruised, but, OH WAIT! Neo ain't all-powerful no more either so they're all dead anyway... who wrote this garbage??...). The whole thing just felt like they took all the good from the FIRST film, put it into a blender, and threw it on screen since the audience wasn't gonna catch up anyway because it's ""art"".B***. S***. I can cut off my ear too but it don't make me Picasso.And just because a bunch of fanboys and fangirls that are trying to sell tickets ""get it"" doesn't mean it's any good. Anyone can find something redeemable in a steaming pile of crap if you dig hard enough.And I gotta say... If you're gonna replace an all-time villian like Hugo Weaving with Doogie Howser M. D... Hollywood needs new casting directors -- and writers/directors.This was all kinds of bad. I'm not faulting Keanu and Carrie. They acted what they were given on the script. This is the studio and the ""filmmakers"" monstrosity thrown together as a desperate cash grab to squeeze more money out of the sheeple they despise so distinctly in the film.Thanks, Wachowskis. You ruined the franchise. Now retire to your palaces built on sham profits and leave filmmaking to people who actually want to make coherent and entertaining films.The Matrix is truly... dead.",1
314,"....or you could be one of the millions worldwide who were born and aware of life prior to the release of The Matrix(1999). The original, on its own, was deep in innuendos while groundbreaking in production and direction. In viewing The Matrix(1999) today, many current real world issues and commentary are discussed in great detail, setting this film as a visionary masterpiece. Now, there were two other Matrix films shortly released after the original that diverted from the apparent beaten path laid down by the original - not part of this discussion. Have you ever brought food home from the restaurant that, when originally served tasted immaculate, but just doesn't taste(or look) the same reheated at home - well, The Matrix Resurrections(2021) is such an example. Taking the leftovers of The Matrix(1999), The Matrix Reloaded(2003) and The Matrix Revolutions(2003) from the refrigerator after 20 years, mixing it all into one container then sticking it in the microwave and expecting the same taste and freshness from when it was first prepared.....no, that's not going to happen. The Matrix Resurrections(2021), also known as The Matrix Regurgitations or The Matrix Resuscitations or.....crap is a retelling of the original trilogy adapted for 2021. Gone are the extensional meanings of decades past and in place are the 21st century paint-by-numbers, gone are the groundbreaking special effects and in place is something that could have been produced by a CW Network team. The original concepts of (Larry and Andy) Lana and Lilly fall off the bridge and into the void below within the first 5 minutes of these reheated leftovers. If you have never seen any Matrix films, avoid this major catastrophe and instead discover The Matrix from the beginning, as it was intended to be told.",1
315,"All the hype of this movie is not warranted as it is a shambles compared to the original 3 movies, i would not recommend this movie, the script was terrible and action scenes not so good either and the actors can only do a certain job with what the director and production team give them to work with.",1
316,Watched the first 20 minutes and walked out.Was this made for the Scyfy channel?How can they seriously make a movie attached to such a franchise so cheap and bad?Hollywood has completely lost the plot.I hope Keanu gives all his fee to charity again...I wouldn't want to associate myself to making money from this garbage.,2
317,"This is bad.It's meta, but still terrible.Way too much exposition, and way too much new versions of old characters.It's as bad as the original sequels, maybe even worse.The Matrix should have stayed as a stand alone film. Greed has ruined it.Shame on everyone involved in this mess.",2
318,Why even make this movie? Expected a lot but this was such a let down. Neo and trinity look exhausted just like the audience after watching the movie.,5
319,"Probably the worst movie of 2021, I can't imagine the idea to make this movie, 1 hour of keanu been a video game designer, 1 hour on how to save Trinnity and 10 minutes of a final fight.There's more on this movie I suppose but I can't find the plot because is just lazy bringing clips of the old matrix to explain things because they can't write properly the movie.",2
320,"This is a film that has motives beyond entertaining fans or telling a story. I say this only because it failed to do either one. It's packed full of self serving, egotistical jargon and flashbacks, often negating the impact the original film had.The original film had a build up and slowly revealed the hidden truth. ""Do you want to know what it is?"" Lawrence Fishborne said that line and slowly painted a picture of reality. This movie reveals everything in the first 15 minutes and your forced to sit through another 2+ hours to see it unfold.The ""hidden"" messages and symbolism were way too obvious. Your constantly smacked in the face with ""The Matrix"" bla bla bla ""The Matrix"". It's no secret. The matrix still exists and everyone knows it.There is also a significant amount of ""woke"" catchphrases slipped into the script obviously designed to make statements. The only problem is that the efforts contradict the plot.NPH acts annoyed and says ""why does everything have to be so binary? The world isn't black and white.""Well it has to be binary because it's a computer simulation and that's how computers talk...in binary. It's obvious that he says this to make viewers think binary labels are ridiculous, but its actually nonsense in this context.Speaking of binary...The red pill and blue pill were always symbols of choice. Choice is the only thing you really can control. At some point they say that ""it's just an illusion"" and your fate is already decided. Then they go back and say that you have to choose to take the red pill?! Then they change their mind again when the story demands it. So many confusing things are happening during the heist sequence, I still don't actually know why they did certain things. This movie is really a mess of plot holes and weak characters.",2
321,If you saw space jam 2 and then you saw this movie you and honestly think this movie's worse Warner Bros makes absolutely awful movies awful movies I can't believe they ruined the matrix like this I would never request anyone to watch this movie the fight scenes are garbage the movie is boring don't watch just give it a pass.,3
322,"...This movie needs a cyanide pill instead.This movie reinforced three things I already knew...A 4th Matrix was not needed.Studio executives care more about money grabbing cash cow sequels than they do about legitimate entertainment. (And to an extent, I get it, because businesses function by making money).Every single character that Jada Pinkett Smith plays is truly unlikeable by virtue of the way she acts.The first Matrix movie was great. The next two Matrix movies were not anywhere near as good, but the 4th installment makes the last two look like Hollywood gold.Resurrections (and the latest Spider-Man movie) consists of 95% nerdstalgia and 5% real substance. (I might be a little generous with that ratio). A few nods to previous work is fun and enjoyable, but it shouldn't be the driving force behind the story.Speaking of ""the story""...what really was the story? Whatever is was surely wasn't thought through very well.I was really looking forward to this movie, so I stayed away from most of the details. Unfortunately, this movie is a huge middle finger to Matrix fans and audiences in general.",3
323,"It was just the same plot a Matrix 1, just that the interactions and fights were more annoying.Money grab. Same mistake as Star wars did, this is so stupid.",4
324,"Script - a mess.Story - a mess.Acting - a mess.Visuals - a mess.Casting - a mess.Action - okayish, hence two stars instead of one.I wanted to like this movie so badly, because I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it.A totally pointless sequel, that almost nobody wanted.I will say this, though, they did the right thing releasing it at Christmas, because it's a turkey.",2
325,"I had to see the new Matrix because it's just the Matrix. I liked the trailers quite a bit. Unfortunately, I take it I was fooled and just fell into some sort of illusion that it could be good. I'm totally disappointed. When the movie started, for the first 10 minutes or so I was like yeah, this is it. I liked it. It was great. But it didn't take long for it to get bad. Very bad. There was a point where I thought, they've already messed this up and they don't have a chance to fix it. Unfortunately, that feeling stayed with me for the rest of the movie. After about 15 minutes, I was not entertained, not interested in the film, and found the story to be bad. I like the series a lot and consider the trilogy to be something amazing and yes, I like Reloaded and Revolutions a lot too, but this, this really didn't. I didn't like the new The Matrix Resurrections perhaps at all. The only thing that appealed to me here and there was the action because it had good music. After that, though, it immediately disappointed me because it had weird slow-motion stuttering effects in places that movies like that used in the 2000s. Whether this was supposed to be some kind of nostalgia here or something that was supposed to look good, I don't know. The action from the original Matrix, which came out in 1999, seemed much better to me at the same time because it didn't have these slow motion moments as far as I know. Where I have to nitpick is Neo himself. I think he's pretty much useless here. His younger self would have kicked his ass. I get that they were trying to capture the fact that he's aged here and that he's not as good as he once was, but for me he was really rubbish and in a way that I thought it was completely, but utterly unnecessary in the finale to make this sequel. The story is terrible in my opinion and I haven't even mentioned that it tries to somehow connect the previous films and explain some things about them, which usually doesn't work out well and here it turned out I would say downright awful. The action is often worse than in the previous films because Neo isn't what he used to be. Unfortunately, I don't see anything good about this movie except for a few moments with good music. I don't think this should have happened. It spoils the franchise unnecessarily. More franchises have had such an unpleasant sequel, like Terminator, Alien, Predator and so on. Now, sadly, I can confirm for myself that this ""money machine"" and wringing of a well-known brand was also given to the Matrix. For me, a very bad movie that I recommend avoiding and fans of the franchise should avoid. Overall, it strikes me as a better fan-made movie than a true sequel.",3
326,"The first and main reason for the failure of the movie is Neo's new appearance because I really did not care to watch the movie after the first appearance of the new neo at the beginning of the movie, terrible dribble of a film .. has no ideological depth .. and reduces the notion of awakening to petty romantic love (while mixing in infantile indoctrination about gender non-conformity) ultimately this is a failure of a project, because it represents the exact type of (media) oppression it is supposed to criticize - it truly is part of the matrix. The matrix originals were so EPIC!!!!! It was also very serious, like if you saw an agent run, or you will die. Here it was like when you see an agent, just make a funny joke and do whatever. Don't worry you'll be alright. Like when they swarmed i was like, meh. The original trilogy delt with the extinction of man and enslavement. This dealt with, um, i guess, saving Trinity? Oh, and news flash, we just don't care about freeing people from the matrix anymore, which was the whole point of the first matrix. It wasn't epic, it just wasn't. I was just so disappointed. It was so bad. I feel so bad/disappointed, Matrix 1 is one of my fav movies ever and i like 2 and 3 way more than the avg person so i obviously was really excited for 4 but oh boy. I only watched it once, and it felt so bad. Bad cinematography, they ruined the aesthethic made even more obvious every time they cut to the original movie, awful soundtrack and sfx, the fight coreography was non existant, going in and out of the Matrix was trivialized since now it seems you can get out anytime you want? I was exited for Io a new city but then it looks like 4 or 5 people live there, Morpheus acts like a he dont know how to acts, the Agents are no longer tough/threatening, it was way too Meta for my liking it felt like they were not taking it seriously and making fun of people for liking the original movies, they put Zombies and Star Wars like cute drones in Matrix! I think they ruined it with all the mentioned above. The joke and tone specially, felt way too humorous, like a parody. Imagine if they would have done those first 30 minutes of Neo dealing with traume but in a Joker style it could have been so good.",1
327,"I never used to really think that paid shills would flood ratings on websites such as this, but now whenever I see a mediocre film that everyone is politicizing(either due to it's political nature or not), it always seems to be flooded with untold thousands of 10/10 ratings. Go now and look at the numbers of people that rated this film by clicking on the rating at the top of the film's page. As of typing this; 36.1% of the ratings, yes over a third of all ratings for this film, are 10/10. Even if you really liked this movie, you can't give it a 10/10. That rating inherently means that it is a perfect film, or at least the best film ever made so far. Even if you like this film, any person who is sincere knows this isn't a 10/10, because it objectively isn't.My actual rating of this movie is 3/10, it is an inferior product in almost every way to it's predecessors, yes that includes Reloaded and Revolutions, and finding positive elements to it is difficult. The VFX is what you expect from a modern high budget film, and a couple of the actors worked, but everything else is off and out of place. The reason this review has 1/10 rating is purely to counter the blatantly obvious paid shilling that is pumping up the numbers for this film. Why do these review websites allow this blatant tampering?",1
328,"This is Matrix for the woke. Let's see, we have multiples of every race injected now. Females inexplicably are stronger than men now. White males are slow and stupid now. Uh oh . . . How do we inject a LGBTQ+ character into the mix? Augh! Wait, wait, let's invent a role for Neil Patrick Harris!! Yay!Wait, what about the story? Story shmory, that doesn't matter. We checked all the woke boxes. Send it to the box office!Hey, what went wrong?",5
329,The Matrix is one of my favourite movies ... the the subsequent sequels were boring and a let down. I watched this out of curiosity. In contrast to The Matrix this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever watched.,1
330,"Sorry Keanu, I was excited when I heard about this movie but I had to turn it off. It was ruining the the other movies for me.This is just sad. Its like the movie is basically telling us that its a bad idea.Keanu is the best actor in the film, yet he's not great due to the horrible cast.Its just bad, so so bad. Damn!!!",3
331,"I usually don't write reviews, but the matrix is one of my top 3 movies of all time, I liked reloaded and revolutions (they are not groundbreaking, but they are fine additions to the concept, the Animatrix is great) and this thing is just...The real score should be around 5, but I give it 1 because:1) Nothing new is added to the concept of the matrix at all2) Weakest script ever3) the whole plot is - we have to save Trinity, nothing more4) love is very important thing in the matrix, but the fourth one is only about love5) it looks cheap - the frame rate is a mess, looks like soap opera on the cable ( it is strange that no one is talking about it).6) action scenes - There is no cool fight, no good action scenes7) music and soundtrack - just awful compared to the original film and the whole trilogy8) Meta - it could be very interesting approach for a matrix movie, but it is executed terribly.In a few words, there is nothing that I loved from the Matrix in this movie, nothing! It is just a bad joke with a cult movie that changed the cinema industry in 99 on many levels (philosophical, visually, sound ect.)The Wachowski thing needs to be kicked out of their own great universe that they have created in order the matrix to be saved, as it seems that their talent was cut with other things.",1
332,"Now we know who the talent one isn't and that is Lana...One of the best trilogies contributed to the realm of Scifi has now been torn down in less than three hours all because of a weak woke agenda...Shame on Keanu for not standing up to Lana about Laurence...Fans know that it's all about Neo and Fishburn's Morpheus, period.",2
333,"1- makes reloaded and revolutions look so good2- I was actually hooked the first hour, had so much potential, and then became so generic, unoriginal, and nonsensical3- I dunno how you can have better CGI and still have worse effects than the original made 20+ years agoOh well, goodbye mr. Anderson.",1
334,"Don't Waste a second of your precious time on this earth watching this crap. The production value is very subpar. It's the quality of a made of tv cheesy episode in both production and story. Of which there really wasn't a story, it seemed more like bits and pieces the whole time waiting for the movie to start. Then it ended as an ego message, seems it's not really a movie at all but someone's underhanded vision of throwing their toxicity in the viewers face. This is a waste of anyone's time and should not have the Matrix name on it but a more fitting title would be ""A Poisonous After School Sprcial"" bought to you by someone that thinks the viewer is a fool and an idiot.",1
335,"I rarely put comment , but this week I saw an amazing movie (don't look up) and a ""daube"" that is what we call a terrible movie in French.I watched this movie because i could not believe the comments, I could not believe Keanu one of my favorite actor could be under diazepam the whole movie.Just don't waste your time, the room from Tommy Wiseau is much better.",2
336,"The first Matrix movie is one of the greatest movies of all time, it was and still is legendary, a movie that sparked a new generation of film and shifted the action genre. The 2 sequels were, in my opinion, also great movies. They had flair, and tone, the characters were all well written, the plot, the action and visuals were so good in the og trilogy.This movie is terrible! I struggled to get through this. There is nothing about this movie that feels right, the writting is bad and all over the place. I can understand what the film is trying to do, but it fails on every attempt.For starters, one of the greatest things about the og trilogy was the action. They were beautifully filmed. The action in this film....trash. They use too many cuts and loads of shakey cam. The action went from a unique style to a generic action flick. I've seen better fight scenes in a Michael Bay movie. The visuals... urgh. The CGI in this feels like a cartoon at times. How did they manage to mess this up? The Visuals should have been the best thing about this, but they were horrible.There is only one good thing about this movie, which stops it from getting a 1 star, and that's Neo and Trinity. They don't spend much time together, but their scenes were really good. But that is about it. Nothing else.The new Morpheus and Smith are a joke. They don't even have the slightest on screen presense that the original actors had. This isn't a dig at the actors, but the film itself. Nothing the Wachowskis have done since the og trilogy has been good, and after this movie, I'll be really surprised if they get another chance to finish these movies, or any movie for that matter.I am going to pretend like this movie doesn't exist in the lore of the series. It's a shame the legend that is Keanu has to have the name of this film stuck to his name, and I'm even more furious it's because of this film that we won't have John Wick 4 for another year!",3
337,Bad directionStupid writingBad music and sound tracksBad visualUgly action scenesAnd as well stupid acting from all actorsIt looks like cheap series for the matrix not a movieI think the trilogy required a 4 th part but not that stupiditySo let me search for this bucket of blue bills.,1
338,"This movie was pretty intriguing for the first hour. I thought it was an interesting spin on things, how the Matrix could be reloaded/restarted/respun according to what we know of the Matrix. Everything fitted in nicely enough but something did grate on me almost immediately, that I tried to ignore for the next 2 hours.The special FX look cheap. Tacky. Low rent.It wasn't just how they were used, but how everything was shot. The fight scenes looked painfully choreographed, so you just felt like it was like watching a load of extremely fragile pensioners get every second of help they could to make them seem atheletic and doing what they're doing. It doesn't work. It even makes the younger actors look terrible.I gotta agree with other reviewers when I say, it feels unbelievable how this movie could come from the same people who made the original.I mean the lack of style in this movie, and the way it jokes with original, and takes elements from its past to recreate everything similar, but modern, and without polish, or a single element of the bleeding edge of cool/awesome. It leaves you feeling hollow. The saddest part is, they were really trying! I mean, they really tried with this movie, and it just falls so far short. Action scenes don't leave you holding your breath, or your heart racing, they leave you bored, like something you've seen from another movie (done better) and just puzzled why the scene doesn't stop, when it doesn't work.There's a pretty obvious wokeness to the movie, with male actors and characters making up the minority of everyone, and every line said. This is pushed further as the movie continues to a large degree, many will find off putting, as whilst this could be called a respin of the original story, they've clearly switched things to reflect how the Wachowski's have changed.Neil Patrick Harris in this movie! Doesn't even work! He's not serious enough, and he doesn't have the presence in this movie for his part. That's not entirely his fault, he plays his part well, but his character just feels like a cliched baddy, all mouth and no trousers without any personal menace, malice or strength.Overall, this movie is a lot like the orange squash/cordial drink you might have had at school. It's a warm, watered down version of the original, so far gone, what you can taste of the original orange flavour just tastes like chemicals with an aroma of the fruit. I don't even want to think about what they're replacing sugar with now in this remake as it tastes nothing like sugar!I mean as a movie, it is complete, but it sets up a sequel I just couldn't be paid to watch. How it fits in with the original movies? I expect it will just make zero sense, and ruin the original (and its 2 awful sequels) even further.",1
339,"I was extremely disappointed w/ this movie. I love the matrix franchise but this movie was bad.I think the problem was the story - it should have picked up right after Revolutions. The first 1/3 of the movie did not even feel like a movie. The other 2/3 of the film focuses on a single ""ok"" premise but it just did not cut it - and look at the reviews to see our great dissatisfaction. The story should have picked up right after revolutions.Hugo Weaving should have returned as Smith - cannot believe he turned it down over some trash theater which did not do well and shows were cancelled anyway due to COVID. He could have single handedly bumped up the movie's ratings by a couple of stars.And Lawrence Fishburne should have returned as Morpheus.And why did Neo look like John Wick the entire time. This was a Matrix movie - Neo should have looked like Neo. It was completely inappropriate to basically advertise John Wick 4 in a Matrix movie. Neo should have had short hair, no beard, and dressed with the black clothing and black shades, you know, the matrix look. I love John Wick but this was so inappropriate.And we love Neo because he is the strongest in the Matrix but who was the genius that made him so weak in this movie? So weak! Fans do not like to see their favorite protagonist be weak - we want the protagonist to be the strongest, what a terrible decision. John Wick is so popular because the protagonist is so ridiculous lethal. But Neo was weak - genius idea, not.I blame Lana Wachowski for writing this mediocre/failure of a movie and for the terrible ""creative"" directing of this film.5/10, which is an F in an F - A scale.I rewatched the previous three films in preparation for this sequel. I think I will go and rewatch them all again to fill that emptiness inside me I feel after watching this trash. Also, I hope the movie does well financially and that there is yet another sequel, and this is because I love the Matrix franchise so much, w/ the exception of this terrible fourth film.",5
340,"Wow just wow....this is just bad fanfic. I guess we now know which one of the siblings was responsible for the better ideas, writing and directing of the prev GOOD matrix movies.Just retcon the original movie and do the movie over again but except this time make it worst in every way possible, action, fighting, CGI etc...oh and don't forget to make the females more powerful than the males and make Trinity be Neo 2.0 but better.",1
341,"The first 90 minutes are actually kind of interesting.Maybe not what you'd expect from a Matrix film, but not bad either.Sadly this is just the high point before the fall. After that it rapidly descends into all of your worst fears for what a 2021 Matrix would become.The action scenes are not great - they use fast cutting during action that leaves you frustrated and disorientated. The original Matrix and even the two sequels were way, way better for action.Even then I could live with it. I wasn't expecting ground-breaking action. I would have settled for an intelligent deeper dive into how the 'war' ended.But even that's taken away from you.The ending is simply insulting, stupid and lives down to every fear you may have had in advance.What a shame and a wasted opportunity. Pretend this doesn't exist.",3
342,"Not being a die hard Matrix fan I was on the fence about watching this, mainly due to the trend for the Matrix sequels getting progressively sillier as the numbers creep up.The first two were watchable but the deep dive into the mythology, back story and cod psychology/philosophy threatens to undo the goodwill of the initial movies.This basically ranks as being not as good as the first two but better than the third.Its fine as a stand alone action movie, however it doesn't have any of the iconic imagery of the first two movies. Which is quite a shock as currently anything is possible with CGI.The current standard of action movies means thinks ranks as a ""meh"" in terms of excitement. Too many of the set pieces are simply rehashes of those from the previous movies, without adding anything new.Of course we still get the big speeches about reality and social constructionism as if it was the 90s.The problem is however that just like most people who currently talk about these theories, they don't actually understand what they mean or the limits of them. They also wrongly think that facts are old news and that feels trump them, because reality...isn't real.That is because they don't understand that constructing reality only works in domains where reality cannot be tested, such as in the physical world. Feelings are fine but your feelings have nothing to do with the reality of when the bus shows up or indeed whether that metal object with wheels is actually a bus. Movies like this try to preach from a position of knowledge on philosophy, a position which states anything I decide is true because thats what I have chosen to believe.Unfortunately for this position there are people who are educated to the level that actually understands these theories and what they can and cannot explain.The fact that Matrix Resurrections has neither updated its format nor its wrongheaded philosophical message in over 20 years.Which leads onto another issue, we are told in the movie that some of the main players haven't aged, when your eyes and common sense tell you otherwise. Maybe this is part of the directors philosophy that reality isn't real and these actors aren't 20 plus years older?However I think I will stick with reality, positivism and the facts, which are that this is not as good a movie as the director thinks it is. Of course audience feedback and box office will be the real reality test. Reality matters even if some people think it doesn't.",4
343,"Talk about another sequel we, the viewing audience, didn't ask for but anyways stars Keanu Reeves &amp; Carrie Anne-Moss are back (&amp; one of the Wachowski's as a co-writer &amp; director) for this current release. Already having three films which have detailed the architecture of the narrative, this new entry (in which the lore states the matrix is a repeating landscape where the players, human beings, relive their lives over &amp; over as the real bodies lie in dormant stasis providing much needed energy to the mechanical rulers of the planet...whew!) ignores what has come before in order to put the viewership in a happy place...I'm not buying it. Even though on the slimmest of merits, I don't dissuade a sequel but when you dispel w/the past just as an excuse to have your simplistic puzzle pieces fit together then why should I invest my time into this affair? There are some intriguing ideas (in this new world we find out the truce established at the end of Revolutions has IA beings living in harmony w/humans, why not have that be the story?) but instead we have Neo rekindling his power (something already explored in the first film) w/the help of a younger Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), an appearance of Jada Pinkett Smith in old age make-up &amp; even bringing back poor Lamont Wilson (the Merovingian) to hurl sideline insults in French during a late stage melee. Oh well, opportunities lost. Look for Christina Ricci (?) as a software spokesperson &amp; Telma Hopkins (from Gimme a Break) as a resident of the new Zionistic city, IO.",4

You would have thought that after so many years, someone would have been able to come up with a new and fresh story with young characters. Why, oh why, bring back to life the same old (and now extremely boring) Neo and Trinity with virtually zero plot or interesting lines. The pace was so slow and the fight scenes felt poor and repetitive lacking the excitement of the older versions. Not sure what I was expecting, but certainly not to be so much disappointed and frankly really bored. Such a shame.",2
347,"I dunno, they didn't really explain things well in this film at all. I would have loved to have more with Trinity.The movie honestly felt like several movies thrown together into one, and most of the movie was a giant ""LOOK HOW AWESOME THE MATRIX WAS!"" shoved down your throat repeatedly. ""IT WAS SO GROUNDBREAKING"" ""BULLET-TIME!"" ( wasn't the thing that created ""bullet time"" but whatever, there were games with that before this movie). They just did it in it in a movie with actors for the first time with CGI.They didn't explain a LOT of the plot, and it would have greatly improved my enjoyment of it.Why revive them?

349,"The first Matrix was mind blowing because it was so unique and the producer took a lot of risks to innovate: the world, the environment, the characters, the plot...The second Matrix was a let down, it felt like they were just sitting on the first titles success.The third installment got back to the origins, and i really liked it. Also they polished a lot of the actions parts and it was great.The Matrix Resurrection, however, kind of lost its spark for me. I can't really point my finger on it, but I really felt it was boring. Like the second title, they took no risk, didn't innovate (i know it's hard, you can't do that all the time), but above all, it felt like the movie was only capiyalisting on the success of the Matrix franchise.The movie itself starts with another loop, starting from the beginning of the first Matrix - neo, Morpheus, Trinity, blue pill, red pill...

I so wanted to like this and was really excited for it when the news came it's being made. But I didn't care for sarcastic comments about the state of the entertainment industry. We already know that Hollywood these days pumps out mostly unwatchable trash, and reboots and sequels of big franchises are made by corporate suckups who don't understand anything about the material they vandalize. This entry landed The Matrix among the zombie franchises like Terminator, Star Trek and Star Wars. Wish I could say something good about this, but I can't.",3

Was this line a big middle finger to the studio?This unnecessary sequel to a trilogy that already didn't need sequels, abandons the existentialist ideas, questions of determinism and the whole big idea approach of the original and instead decides to go meta on its own lore in a misguided attempt to comment on fandom, tech culture and virtual worlds.Yes, for some reason one of the central plot points of in a Matrix movie released in 2021 is a musing on Second Life - released in 2003.After about an hour of terrible meta jokes, self-reference and desperate attempts to explain the change of key actors, a plot does eventually manifest, though it never manages to capture our imaginations like the original did.This isn't aided by more cringe inducing scenes in Zion which are every bit as bad as they were in parts 2 and 3.It's not all bad. The replacement actors do fine, which is no small task considering they had to play roles made iconic by another actor. The cinematography is excellent in many scenes, and there is some brilliant slow motion trickery on display. There is a LOT of slow motion. As clever as some of these precise shot compositions are compared to the usual ugly CGI messiness of big budget superhero movies, they also make the action a lot less kinetic and dynamic than that of the original movies. Don't expect a Revolutions highway chase style scene here. It's mostly indoor brawls in single locations with a lot of slow motion.Which brings me to my recommendation of who this movie is for:If you're interested in slow motion shooting and cinematography, then you may find some enjoyment in this film. The shot compositions are beautiful.If you're looking for a dumb action movie, then sure. It's certainly more interesting than Black Widow or Eternals.If the original Matrix (trilogy) holds a place in your heart and you don't want to spoil the memory, then do yourself a favor and skip it.Contrary to what some may write based on their animosity of Lana Wachowsky, the movie is not overtly woke. Just because a character has blue hair , doesn't make it Ghostbusters 2016 or The Last Jedi. Not all white male characters are portrayed as either evil or buffoons. And no, it's not an advert for gender transitioning either, not even in the unexplained and cringe inducing ending scene with Trinity. Stop the hyperbole.",4
352,"Even as it criticizes WB for repeating &amp; mining for old nuggets of intellectual property, it can't help but fall in love with its own mythos, both glorifying and poking fun at the previously peddled world vs the less kitschy new one. Problem is the new world is also much more boring and much less imaginative, much less entertaining. I don't like it when a brand tries to make you feel stupid for liking or believing in something for which it sold you and profited. How is that any better than a studio simply regurgitating old material, if you crap all over what they loved and replace it with something less special, more real. I hate that the best moments and shots in this movie are 100% from the old movies. I'll never get why creators hide anxiety of not living up to a classic by literally placing that classic within the new one... that's the worst thing you can do. This film doesn't just nudge you about old shots, moments, lines, plot points... it meticulously re-does them rather than rethink its own structure. It is a terrible sequel, which says it is defying studio expectations while exactly following a formula that even the studio wouldn't have been stupid enough to have done so closely.",2
353,"Yes, the original movie, The Matrix, opened nearly a quarter century ago. To prepare for this, may I suggest that prospective viewers do what I did, and take a look at some photos of yourself from that long ago. See the difference? A lot has changed, and not necessarily for the better. Such is the case with the latest edition of ""Matrix"" films. Let's start with Reeves and Moss, shall we? Reeves does with his hair and beard pretty much what Donald Trump did with his comb-over and orange tan. Namely disguise the fact that no matter how you try to explain it, we are all a bit past our ""best if used by"" date. Ms. Moss has aged substantially more gracefully, but she just doesn't seem have her heart in her performance. It reminded me of that Dan Fogelberg song about Xmas Eve that is inevitability played this time of year. The old magic has slipped away. This is made all the more obvious by the snippets of the prior films being shoehorned into the new film. I thought that was illegal or something. Anyway, it just made me want to turn off the TV, and drag out my dusty DVD of the first Matrix movie. Sigh...You know what hasn't changed much? The quality of the special effects! I mean, here we are, coming up on the second quarter of the 21st century, and the special effects STILL look cartoonish. In a lot of respects, the old model based practical effects just look more impressive than these fully ""made in the box"" CGI effects that suck up so many budget dollars. In many respects, the CGI of this film is no better than what was offered up with the original Starship Troopers back in 1997. By this time, I would have expected that the effects team could have made everyone look the same age as back in 1999. After all there, is a brief scene where they make Neo look like he's in his late sixties. Why can't they do the reverse?What also feels wrong are the actors who replace Morpheus and Agent Smith. They are not bad as actors go, but they are not the originals. The fact that the original Neo and Trinity are present, just make the absence of Smith and Morpheus that much more disconcerting. It's always a dicy proposition when you replace key actors of a film franchise with new faces. The owners of the Star Trek series understood this, and no expense was spared maintaining the original cast until JJ Abrams (badly) rebooted the entire Star Trek universe.There are a few moments in the film where I was genuinely entertained. For example, when the Merovingian reappeared as a homeless raggedy man, who endlessly criticizes the tropes of the 21st century like some old ""boomer,"" I had to genuinely laugh. Indeed, with the exception of Agent Smith, the villains of Matrix past are more deftly dealt with by the writers. Unfortunately, these little glimmers of entertainment cannot rescue a film that, if we are being completly honest, NEVER NEEDED TO BE MADE. I'm sure the producers ""thought"" they could pull off a better ending to the Matrix franchise than Matrix Revolutions in the same way that Rocky Balboa vanquished the stink that surrounded Rocky V. They didn't.",3
354,"I simply don't understand why these movie ppl need to ruin everything. Very disappointed. The movie is totally bad, the plot is bad, the actors are bad... the acting is bad.",1
355,"Lana, if you didn't want to make this movie, why the hell did you?Did someone force you? Maybe you needed to recoup all the countless losses after the original Matrix trilogy. I kinda get it. No wonder Lily didn't want anything to do with one; she could sense the bullsh*it from miles away.True and utter garbage. A convoluted, boring, metanarrative overlong piece of junk that thinks it's saying something when all it is, are the ruminations of a person who didn't want to make the movie but did it anyway.",1
356,"One of the few occasions I have been really, REALLY disappointed in my 32 years on this planet. Looks cheap, smells cheap, feels cheap. This should have never gone into production. It doesn't add anything to the Matrix trilogy and the story was sucked out of one's thumb only to financially revive some folks. Feels like a parody or fan made movie. New Morpheus was just...BAD. Unmemorable (as most of the characters) and I will soon forget that this was even released. Only reason I'm giving 3/10 is Keanu. You are breathtaking!",3
357,"In my honest opinion, the matrix franchise is one of the worst franchises in movie history. I think the first matrix was ok sci-fi action movie, I was too young when the first one was out (born in 1997), so I when I watched the first one I thought it's an ok movie. The two sequels were bad movie, especially the third one.This one is also bad, boring and uninteresting sci-fi movie that have nothing new or unique to bring to the table. Don't expect a lot from a movie has the word resurrection in its people. The acting was painfully bad; I did not care for anyone. The action sequences are bad, boring and uncreative. The script is unreasonably awful, the movie did not have an identity, I think the reason is that The Wachowskis are one of the most criminally overrated directors of all time.Final thoughts: Watch this If you want to waste two and half hours of your life on a bad, boring and long movie, the choice is yours.",2
358,"This is a film in four parts.Part one is the first half hour. Self-aware, fourth-wall breaking, tongue-in-cheek nonsense! I'm not surprised people got up and left. I was tempted myself. When ""our parent company Warner Brothers"" gets a mention you know it's silly.Part two is more like The Matrix we know. Great visuals. Lots of action. Keanu shows his age a little in the slower action but it's still good. More akin to the latter two of the trilogy i.e. The story is a bit convoluted so best not to overthink it.Part three is the ending. It comes to rather a speedy conclusion. Felt like they just thought ""that's enough"" and gave up.Part four is the post-credit scene. Back to self parody again with possibly the single worst minute of a movie ever. I'll not spoil it for you but it was an attempt at a joke.. It wasn't funny.As a big fan of the very first film (never fussed with the sequels), the most damning thing I can say is I'd happily have not wasted two hours of my life on this.",4
359,"Like many other recreations this is yet another one that rehashes the same story in a Woke package with race and gender diversification and that the One is not actually the One but the Two, I guess.Woke rubbish that does not add anything to the previous movies.",2
360,"Resurrection? He better be dead in our mind. The story and the Cinematics are the best holder for The Matrix Trilogy, that is dead here. It is been 20 years, the technology is improved so much that the cinematic could do better than the The Matrix 1999 but they missed the shot. This is very flat and disengaged. At some point I was thinking like watching a worst Marvel Movie yet.We Miss Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, can't take some one else to deliver his performance. Feel very bad for a Matrix Fan. When he was yelling ""Mr. Anderson"", I yelled ""Really?""And finally all the people of Zion fell to Matrix and they want to live in wonder world? So Neo and Trinity gave up. It broke the purpose of first 3 movies.Very loose script, bad handling of the plots; spoiled the The Matrix universe.I better erase the part that I see this movie. I never age 1 rating for any of the Hollywood movies yet. This is first time.",1
361,"We need to stop making reboots just for the sake of making reboots. This feels nothing like the original trilogy, it's weird to watch and it's a lot of recycled material. Quite disappointing.",4
362,"There will be spoilers, so beware.This movie is a bloody very convoluted and complicated mess of ideas about loops where you can easily get lost what was before and what was after. In no particular order let me just list its pros and cons.Let's start with cons:If you haven't watched the first three movies, you'll be lost and nothing will make any sense.Quite old Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss - well, they don't pull the chipper or look like they have superhuman abilities.The light humor sprinkled all over the place is somewhat inappropriate, considering the atmosphere of the previous films and the state of the current one (where people continue to live in a giant cave underground).Everything is lazy, overdramatized and the support cast doesn't have enough motives to vindicate their actions and heroism.Some machines have joined humans because ... reasons?The first three movies were really brutal and there's very little of it here despite its R-rating. There's zero nudity aside from bare hardly seen buttocks as well.Most fights are recorded using SHAKY camera.The end was turned into romantic/communist trash.The last battle/chase - oh, god, it's cringe-worthy.No bullet time fights whatsoever!No memorable scenes or dialogues.Too much dialog which tries to sound intelligent (the worst thing about Matrix II).Neo turned into a pussy.Trinity learned to fly right away while Neo couldn't quite master it until the very end of the movie.Too much mental problems (including suicide, self-loathing, depression and apathy), probably referring to the script writers.As with many (all?) superhero movies before it the abilities the characters have depend on the situations they are put in and the plot which is IMO should be left to fairy tales.Hardly any new ideas.What's the point of the whole movie again?Pros:Self-irony and self-reflection in bulk.Ridiculing anything and everything (in the movie someone says that Warner Brothers ordered The Matrix 4 game), including religions, habits, marketing, human nature.Some philosophy like there's no freedom of choice, even in the real world.Overall it's a fan service and not very good at that. If I were to rate the Martix movies from the best to worst, the list would be: 1, 3, 4, 2. The last two on this list should probably have never been made.",4
363,"The movie is a set of scenes of violence which are ridiculous because meaningless, of an exaggerated number, and where no one dies except some poor human. Incomprehensible film between reality and software, stupid fruit of today's generation, full of people with the wrong education, and the lower and lower IQ. We are in the ridiculous 'Technological Dark Ages' while the virus has already arrived and wars arrive soon.",3
364,Painful to watch... it looked like a parody of itself. Why God... why!?!?!?!I'm a big fan if the Trilogy... I was hopeful... but oh my God... so disappointed.,1
365,"I felt like I was watching a bad 2001 documentary with a crap load of flashbacks of the original three films CONSTANTLY reminding us on how great they were and how bad this one is. Have you noticed that there are plethora of movies with ""Resurrection(s) in the title and they flop harder than a fish out of water? Half of the film was filled with flashbacks from the trilogy that recreated the genre with something we've never seen before. The fight scenes are so clunky and all over the place it was hard to comprehend wtf was happening. In the older films, the camera work was focused on the actions because that's what added to the quality. There was a flow and it was darn sure fluid. There were cuts in this film that were so unnecessary it made me so angry. I know the cast (from the original movies) are all older, but come on. It's like they didn't try! There were so many jokes in the most awkward of places as much as there were a ton of unnecessary random characters eith no backstory and little to care for. The film also does a job breaking the fourth wall telling us what we should already know. This movie is forced. Lastly, my GOODNESS the slow motion scenes are bad. It's like they took everything from original films and dialed it back one hundred notches.. like watching the movie in 10 frames per second. The editing felt like a Sci fy original B-movie. It was not entertaining at all. The new ideas are what we've seen before in countless attempts with nothing to bring to the table. Two hours and thirty minutes of just false promises and underwhelmed build ups.They were going for a story that reexplained the older films. We love matrix so much BECAUSE of the storytelling and the over-the-top slo mo action that set beyond so many boundaries in cinema history. I'm mad that we have Carrie-Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves, such AMAZING LEGENDARY ACTORS, with a great cast withered away by the terrible attempt to finish what had already ended years ago. Matrix Resurrections failed on many attempts to keep that inspired awe feeling we used to get years ago from those old films. The trilogy provided well choreographed sequences that pushed the boundaries beyond pur limitations without over filling our plates. You KNEW when something amazing was coming up next because of the transition and the pacing. Unfortunately, this movie just ... failed.",1
366,"I REALLY wanted to love this movie. I am a huge fan of all three of the first films, but Resurrections just didn't capture the magic formula. It was wonderful to see Neo and Trinity together again, and all the actors do what they can with what they are given. But the story is a jumbled mess that is hard to follow at times and rushed at others. I think they simply tried to do too much in one film. Maybe it was cut down for time and we'll get an extended version one day that adds in all the cut scenes to make the film make more sense, like the Snyder Cut did. The first have is long and boring, and the second half looks like a Michael Bay movie at times, with editing that looks like it cut out half the story. It simply didn't feel like a Matrix movie.",5
367,"It looks like I'm not the only one who was disappointed with this movie ... what a major letdown. Probably my personal biggest movie downer since The Dark Tower. In this case, the action sequences were generic (could have happened in Bourne or Marvel or Bond), the camera work was self-absorbed (e.g., let's get a great color shot without regard to story or other composition), and the story. What a weird mix of boring moments and unearned surprises.For me, it boils down to a character suddenly and inexplicably gaining superpowers toward the end of the film; bad enough itself for poor storytelling and character development, but then not really doing anything with those powers? Sudden ""plot twist"" (if you can call it that) with no payoff. The movie is full of these.The actors do a pretty good job (although the Bugs actor could open her mouth a bit more to avoid a near-mumble), and some of the shots were genuinely impressive. But that's not enough to get around a ridiculous central plot that never quite lands.One more piece of evidence here -- maybe I'm sheltered, but I have never heard a live audience react so negatively to a movie before. Plenty of pointed comments aimed at the screen. Lots of disappointment to go around.The movie had so much potential but They tried to be too clever for their own good.",4
368,"No need for spoilers here. Terrible. Poorly written and no need to see it in the theatre. Wait for it to come out on Netflix. Should not have been made, waited too long as well.",5
369,"I'm not really sure if this film really needed to be made, and the depressing thing about it is that it ended in a rather similar way to the first film, suggesting that they might go ahead and make two more. Okay, there does seem to be a pattern emerging where popular films from twenty years ago are having sequels made to see where the characters are after all this time, and what has been going on, but sometimes I do sort of wonder what the point is. Sure, Bill and Ted's worked, though I am yet to see the new Ghostbusters film, but I did sort of feel that this film was something of a let down. However, I still really don't want to give too much away.It turns out that Thomas Anderson, otherwise known as Neo, is actually a video game designer, and had written three very popular games called 'the Matrix'. However, he has decided that he no longer wants to make any more, but has been pressured by Warner Brothers to release a fourth one. It also turns out that Trinity is that woman named Tiffany who is happily married with two children. They do see each other occasionally, namely at a coffee shop, but while they have an inkling they might know each other, they don't know where from. Finally, Thomas happens to be seeing a psychiatrist because he tried committing suicide by walking off the top of a building, thinking that he could fly. It turns out that he was so involved in these games that he is lost touch with reality, and he must continue to take blue pills to keep him grounded.The rest of the film is basically the Matrix, but you have probably already guessed that. It does seem to be exploring the nature of reality, and the idea that the psychiatrist suggests that they might not necessarily be grounding us in the reality that we need to be grounded in. In fact, they might be keeping us in a prison of our own mind. Then there are the drugs, which in some cases seem to do the same thing. In fact, people have suggested that pumping ourselves full of drugs, and this being prescription drugs (and not the life-saving kind) is doing us more harm than good.I guess the idea behind this film seems to be more about how society is binding us to a mindless and boring existence, that is preventing us from actually going out and exploring life. Now, don't get me wrong, I do believe the psychiatrist, psychologists, and counsellors really do have roles to play with overcoming trauma and depression, it has more to do with this idea of being stuck in a mindnumbing world where we spend five days (or more) simply working for a mindless entity for a bare minimum that will allow us to survive (and this is applying to office workers - it gets even worse in the service industry). It seems that one of the problems that we face in our modern world is that the monotony of our existence means that we need to pump ourselves full of useless drugs, and pay money to therapists, just to keep on plodding along to a meaningless end.The thing is that throughout the film there are flashbacks to the previous films, suggesting that there is more to this monotony that what we are encapsulated in, and that there is a way to break out of it and return to that time when things seemed to be better, and that we actually enjoyed life. While the answer may not be taking the red pill, sometimes we need to listen to those around us, and even listen to strangers that approach us, that may just be able to pull us out of this meaningless monotony to a world that is truly full of life.",4
370,"They look like a Kpop band, they turned morpheus ne into an old idiot, and the fight scenes are worthy of the '80s. What they did with this movie was a crime.",1
371,"This was not a good movie, infact it was so bad it put me to sleep. I could tell as soon as the movie started that the reviews were right- it was bad.... really bad, i sure hope Keanu Reeves has Insurance for his hair cut, if he really got that- it wasn't worth it.......",3
372,"If you're in your late 30's or older, you'll know what piece of crap this movie is. The Matrix series was a genre defining, unprecedented series of movies that was perfect in every aspect! It took. Fight scenes to a whole new level, pushed color grading beyond its limits, integrated awesome and unbelievably expressive soundtrack, created new cinematographic techniques specially for the 360 view effect, all to build an eye popping story that sucks you in from the very first frame of the movieBut this?? OMG! This movie has transformed the franchise into an ugly deformed piece of crap, that neither achieved the strength of a classic nor the beauty of the modern.",1
373,"This is my fandom, I love this franchise. The games, movies, one offs, everything. I love it. I dont know who this movie is for.This is a fan film. That may be a disservice to fan films, but it is bad.Positives: Keanu doesn't miss a beat as Neo.Mixed: CGI is good at time, but need a touch up in several shotsNegatives: Plot is 90% exposition and one 10% of that is relevant. Meta is out of control. Action is awful. Little to no Martial arts and just force pushing. Editing is atrocious, pulling from past clips, choppy action, no continuity through theme, just bad at a technical level and a story level.",3
374,Amateurish cash grab unfortunately.The only good thing about this film is the flashback scenes from the original trilogy.. maybe not revolutions but even that looks like a masterpiece compared to this.I'm embarrassed on behalf of Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann-MossPlease learn from my mistake and don't watch this.,1
375,"Just watch the original and try to pretend that The Matrix Resurrections doesn't exist.Congratulations, Lana Wachowski, for completing your actual transition from being a great filmmaker to officially becoming a terrible one.",2
376,"I knew Matrix Resurrections was bad, but I didn't know how bad, so I decided to watch it. I was surprised to see that it was even worse than I thought. First of all the whole movie was totally unnecessary. The whole plot had no real and significant purpose, they should have left it a trilogy, the 3rd movie ended good . There were too many references to the first Matrix it kind of felt like a parody of it at some point. The movie leaves this feeling that it wasn't made by the same people , it felt like a cheap Netflix version of the Matrix made by someone who's just learning how to make movies. Or maybe it was super important to take a d7mp on the trilogy with that modern progressive agenda.",1
377,"The 1st Matrix was good. Very good. Then 2 and 3 was barely watchable. Now, I gave this one a shot, hoping to see something good. But what was the point?Let's start with the good. Some of the shots where good. Some of the ideas where good but they last for just one thing. It was well shot and most of the effects where good.Now for the bad. Since I will not spoil, let's just say that there is a lot of ""flash back"" done in a terrible way. The 1st 30 min of the movie, is painful to watch. Lots of weird decision. And the story is terrible. The acting is passable but not the best. And some of the action fighting is either messy or boring. And one on one combat is laughable. Look at the Matrix trilogy or John Wick. How did they go from there to this.If you are a die hard fan, don't watch it. If, like me, just liked it. Watch it with very low expectation and you might have some enjoyment here and there.",3
378,"I really felt just kinda bored, like I knew what was going to happen at every beat. This is likely because it really did feel like a retread of plot points of these films. As much flack as the second and third films got, they still had moments of intrigue, paradoxes, and a running plot.Even the action scenes failed to be any better than the original. That choreography looks dated, because its been done to death and we've seen Reeves do far better in the John Wick franchise.Lastly recasting Morpheus and Mr Smith was just terrible. Morpheus is now younger, hipper and has a wacky fashion sense(orange suit, really?) He lacks the charisma of Fishburne. Mr Smith just looks generic, rather than Hugo Weaving with his sinister look ad frightening scowl. Didn't really care for NPH either. Jada's makeup sucked.Ultimately an effort was made to reboot the movies by taking a incredibly simple, similar, predictable path. While the first was a groundbreaker, the second kept me guessing, and the third had just enough to not spoil the trilogy, this is the nail in the coffin.",3
379,"Of the four theatrical Matrix movies, this one wasn't bad, but I'd still rank it as third best.All the way through this reminded me of Scream 4 where I thought it was good, but did I want it? Nope. Have I seen it more than once? No. Probably never will. This M-IV also reminded me of 2021's other two unnecessary fourth entries: Candyman and Ghostbusters Afterlife. Both 2021's Candyman and The Matrix Resurrections contained about 10% recycled footage from (mostly #1 of) the original trilogy. And all three also ask you: ""Hey! Remember Part One?"" over and over and over and over to the point where I was wishing I watching the original movie again, instead.The opening and premise presented: I loved. Well, until it dragged. They did sadly draw out the wonderful explanation of the new world everyone lives in post-part 3. It was then I realized: Oh, there's not going to be a lot of action in this action sequel. And, unfortunately, I was right.But, again, it's fine. If you liked the others, you'll most likely be fond of this. The plot, story and old characters are exactly as you'd think they would be. I'm not sad I saw it, but like Scream 4: I think this was a one and done viewing.***Final Thoughts: And yes, I do hope they don't make anymore. I probably won't see any more of them even if The Matrix is back for another trilogy.",5
380,"To be clear, if you are one of the few who have never watched the franchise before, you will enjoy it..... you should probably stop reading my review now.If you have watched the others then here are two options, rewatch them again then... maybe watch this one. Or option number Two, dont bother. The money spent on making this would have been better spent remastering the original films.It comes across as another attempt to cash in on a franchise and fails hard. There is an old adage ""if it ain't broke, dont fix it"" words to live by, shame all involved didnt think it through.I'm being generous with 3 stars.",3
381,"I'd really like to go into detail about all the things that people have missed in their reviews, but most sum it up pretty well... Complete garbage, unnecessary, and literally tried to say the last few movies never happened..nothing makes sense, please watch this movie to the end and try to think""What is the actual story here? What did they even do?""because it is just entirely full of convoluted plots that make no sense.Basically, the Matrix trilogy never happened and was just a video-game but no it actually happened somehow and the whole concept of freedom, the war between machines, doesn't exist or matter because 'machines gonna be enslaving' so all you can do is really fight for control over the simulation they all live in..? Bugs even makes the comment about how if you remember it then it basically makes it reality...NO it doesn't. There was no need for this plot.And this is ALL just a background story now because of the weirdly spot-lighted romance between Neo and Trinity that is suddenly so important for reasons... and he only has his powers because of Trinity is sooo dumb, but don't worry, they're gonna give us plenty of woke-nonsense about how Trinity is now The One because it's the womans' turn now..yaaay :/ I'm all for equality and support feminism but this is just very cringe for me..Of course the acting is terrible...mostly due to Keannu, he really just has no expressions ever, it's been decades of people making jokes about how bad his acting is so I'll save you the time and just say it's bad.No good actors returned because this would've just been so bad to read as a script, I get it.. And thank god. They made spoofs of every character, the whole atmosphere was laughably PG like it was being made into some cheap version of Marvels GoTG..did not feel like the Matrix at all, and no Im not an old school whiner like ""the original was the best.."" type person.Smith is back too, because...reasons. The entire plot of him taking over the matrix didn't happen and he's not a threat now because he's back under program-control, but he isn't and still has Neos powers??? Oh and he's a hipster weirdo now who calls Neo Tom like a lot.Im surprised they weren't just giving away the powers of The One to anyone who believes they have it.. And of course Trinity flies and gets his powers so you're like ""Oh great now SHE's the one?"" then they have a terrible dialogue exchange and fly off separately like they were saying ""nah he's still the one too.."" which makes no sense at all. And they do nothing for humanity, which is apparently still enslaved but it's all good because some of the machines are 'free' and join humanity.. They just fly off like ""we're gonna remake the Matrix how we see fit.."" as if it matters that they are making it a more peaceful prison.",2
382,Considering that the original is one of my favorite films and achieves a very rare feat by being entertaining whether or not you're intellectually savvy enough to go down the rabbit hole (it works on any level) - this was borderline unwatchable. It took me three attempts and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't bored and doom-scrolling through much of it as it completely failed to hold my attention.I will always love Keanu regardless and also Lana Wachowski for creating this universe in the first place. What a muddled mess. I'm j no it even interested in digging deeper to unpack what I just watched.The original was so ground breaking in the visuals. Really sad they were unable to take this to another level. The ubiquitous flashback were amateurish and frankly why even use Morpheus or Agent Smith if you couldn't get Lawrence Fishburne or Hugo Weaving.Two stars for Keanu fanboy-ism and Doogie Howzer MD.,2
383,Absolutely Awful .. Pointless garbage How they made the First Matrix which is a classic sci fi is a true Mystery They must have Stolen it from some young writers and paid them to keep quiet .. The Wachowskis Should never touch a phone camera again never mind a movie Camera ...Terrible makes me angry.,1
384,Good thing I didnt spend a dollar on this garbage. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen this year. DO NOT WATCH IT! It is purely horrid. The acting and action is the worst I have seen.,1
385,"I'm probably one of the biggest Matrix fans / supporters you'll ever find. I've seen the original movie countless times, I even went to see it again in IMAX two weeks ago. I even learned to appreciate 2 and 3.I have learned over my 40+ years to control my expectations for anything I'm looking forward to in life. That being said, I was over the top excited to see this in IMAX tonight. I went with my friend who I went to see the original Matrix with in 1999. While walking out we just looked at each other and said the same thing. ""Was that as bad as I think it was or am I missing something?""The trailers were some of the best I've ever seen, the movie, was not.I've never been so disappointed leaving a movie theater. I gave it three stars because I'm a life long fan.Biggest issue... Supporting cast is brutal.",3
386,"If i should describe this movie with one word it would be ""mediocre"". It doesn't excel in any area. There are some bad some good fight scenes, some good humor, some jokes land and some fail miserably. Writing is a bit messy with the machines joining the human side and Smith's personal agenda.It felt like they wanted to give a spin to the original movie trying to explain things and the why(s), but many parts they failed.There was not a single action scene or any scene to be fair that was remarkable or memorable.Just put in a lot old scenes old characters, remarks. But the worst part is Neo felt like a watcher. Imagine if in a Batman movie batman would just mostly sit and watch what Robin does. That's how the movie felt.Here is the new crew who are the main characters of the movie and Neo is like a bystander.The romance part kinda worked, but also they made Trinity a mary sue cause we live in a woke era. Yay Trinity instant flying..sure..Overall i don't think i would ever rewatch this it is simply was not needed to be made..",5
387,"There really was no need for this film. A weak script, actions scenes that were not as good as the original three movies, and a cast that could not live up to the originals actors either. The whole film just felt like a tired, boring rehash of the other three movies.",3
388,"I'm going to make this VERRRRRRY short. The ONLY REASON this heap of garbage was made is to rob people out of their hard earned money...and unfortunately they got mine. IF you decide to watch this film,make SURE that you have the ability to view it for FREE...and even THEN it will cost you...it will cost you your precious time.Toodles.",1
389,Certainly action-oriented and visually impressive. Special effects and computer-generated graphics are top-notch. The actors are all excellent in their roles. For me it really didn't add anything of value over the originals.,1
390,"It's painfully obvious that many of the franchise regulars wanted nothing to do with this bomb. Lawrence Fishburne (Morpheus) and even Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) were wise to opt out of this trainwreck. However, all the other b-list money grabbers decided this would be a worthy addition to their resumes. Unfortunately they will be paying the price for their lack of common sense.Apparently after saving the universe, Neo managed to get himself plugged back into the Matrix for several years to the point where his own residual self image is that of a now b-list actor who refuses to shave for every new role he gets.I can't go into too much detail about the rest of the movie because I fast-forwarded through the second hour of this snooze-fest.I wish I could get that 1 hour of precious life back.",1
391,"Keanu Reeves gives an uninspired performance, probably because he knew how bad the script was. The story is convoluted and pointless, and eliminates the wow factor that the first film provided. The Matrix was unique due to its philosophical nature, viewing it would leave your head filled with so many questions, so many interesting ideas; Matrix Ressurections does the opposite, I couldn't wait for this film to end, it filled me with dread. I mean seriously, to reduce the original three films into being videogames made by a couple of insufferable geeks? What an insult.This film did not need to be made. The original trilogy ended perfectly, we didn't need to restart the franchise up again, this is another Hollywood cashgrab, which are sadly a dime a dozen these days. I love the original films, specifically the first two, and it hurts to see the legacy of The Matrix be tainted by this joke of a film.",1
392,"Firstly I loved the first Matrix and really enjoyed the 2 sequels. While I didn't have sky high hopes for this one I thought it can't go too far wrong. It's is so bad, it's just a mess. The effects are poor a muddle of cgi, the story is just basically so thin and pointless, nothing is believable, the old lady general is just awful. Neo touching heads with the robot thing. It shows how good the first movie was. It was a hundred times better than this turd. I wish I'd left half way through like I was tempted to do and save wasting part of my life.",2
393,"You would hope that after 18 years a sequel would be a big, eye-popping production. Sadly, that's not Resurrection. If anything, it came across as a lower budget version of the original Matrix, if it was a series pilot on the SyFy network. It also clearly shows that the first movie was the best and each subsequent installment was a shallower and more convoluted version of the original.",
394,Do not watch this film. Absolutely horrible. I would rather watch all 30 of The Fast and The Furious movies on one continuous loop. The humans involved in making this film should be ashamed of themselves. And what's with the Rage Against the Machine cover in the end credits. Just horrible. I can't believe I stayed and watched the entire film and then to have my ears destroyed by that ridiculous cover. Stupid me.,1
395,"In summary, very poor everything. This movie looked like a parody of the actual Matrix trilogy.The movie was so bad that I didn't even bother watching it till the end. Walking out of the movie before it ended seemed the most decent and logical thing to do.Do yourself a favor and keep away from this one.",1
396,"This film is basically a remake of the first The Matrix film, with some scenes ""inspired"" by the sequels. They also also did an overuse of flashbacks that are direct footage from the previous films. A great method to increase the duration of the film the cheapest way possible.And that tells a lot about how smart everyone involved in this film are. They just did a pastiche of the trilogy we all know, with barely any new ideas, characters or content, and they're going to make millions!I think they also saved a lot of money in the CGI, because it looks cheap indeed, much worse than in the original films. All the action scenes look messy and confusing, nothing like in the previous films. I don't think they hired the same choreographers than last time.I haven't checked what the budget for this film is, but I'm sure it's going to do great, especially considering there's a big audience who have been waiting for a new Matrix film for a long time and would buy a ticket for anything with the matrix brand on it, even if it's a documentary about snails.I should mention I kept falling asleep during the film, but I didn't miss anything because every time I suddenly woke up I rewinded the video. I feel sorry for anyone who paid a ticket to see this because they couldn't be able to do the same and they might have missed important plot points while snoring.",1
397,The first Matrix movie in 1999 was already a perfect package. Unnecessary sequels have been made over and over again to scam people of their cash. This particular one was so bad that I felt embarrassed that I had sat through the first 15 minutes. Filmmakers please consider the environment before you make another sequel. The environment and humanity will thank you!,3
398,Way to much talking not enough action. It felt like they were trying to explain everything to people who have never seen the matrix. Even then my kids who have not seen the matrix were still confused as to what was going on. I feel asleep trying to watch this boring disappointment.,1
399,"I just watched The Matrix - Resurrections and the only thing that's gonna need Resurrected is me. It's bored the life out of me so bad that I've fallen asleep twice trying to endure it.I've currently recovering from this corny, sloppy, forced, long winded, try hard of a Snoozer. Even nostalgia couldn't save it.I should've never taken the Red Pill because the truth is, this movie just sucks.",2
400,"And that includes Reloaded and Revolutions - not that many fans of the original Matrix appreciated what were the sequels going for, so if you're that rare breed of a Matrix fan who has enjoyed everything, including the sequels and Animatrix - the M4trix will make you tear the hair out of your head.Insipid, revisionist, entirely unnecessary - Wachowski has completely lost it.",2
401,"Matrix 4 is so boring. It feels as if was written and directed by Woody Allen. Too many long useless sentimental conversations. The action scenes are pathetic clichés in which there is no emotion whatsoever. The story is terrible and is clearly intended to promote the leftist agenda, relegating Neo, the white male, to the role of a useless jerk.",2
402,"Some die hard fans of the trilogy are claiming Ressuractions so clever and intelligent that ordinary audience won't be able to get it at first. That's why the frustration of the latter led the movie to a free fall rating. Truth be told, it's not the majority of people that are uncapable to understand such a masterpiece, but the fact that it isn't a masterpiece at all. After 20 yrs, Ressuractions is light years behind the 1st one in storyline, relevance and quality, proving that the original idea could live by its own but was so exploited by all different medias in the past that nothing new has left, or maybe the lazyness to expand its universe to a different approach left it in a comfort zone by the writers.For those ones who did watch Scream (2022} will surely notice some resemblances between both movies. First, the idea of retelling the same story in a different way (the 'requel' thing), a superficial argument to overshadow the fact that, on its core, the movie is a poor and disposable remake of itself. Second, the metalanguage, used to explain by didactic means the reasons why ideas are being recycled. Translating, It's like an apology in advance if audience faces the fact that all of it sounds familiar and much like the same.That's why new Mr. Anderson is now a game programmer who created a virtual reality called The Matrix; that's why the original trilogy is now presented as a trilogy of games used tirelessly as flashbacks and deja vus; that's why ""Warner wants a sequel after 20 years"", as one of the chacters say. The meta justifying the requel.My problem with this movie is that Lana Wachowski seems completely lost as a director and as a writer. It's never clear what's the point of it all. And to fill gaps that would be hard to be filled, she uses aforementioned arguments to stretch the story to the unbearable.120 minutes of a pretentious movie that never equals the original, nor the inferiority of the sequels. Full of boring undeveloped one dimensional characters facing redundant events. Most of the times with terrible dialogs that pretend to be funny but never is, like when Morpheus makes his 'homage' to Fishburne's classic appearance, or moments when the movie tries hard to rescue some old references once more raising irrelevant discussions about human existence.Another one said that Ressuractions looks like a bad Scary Movie of itself. Comprehensive. I mean, why would someone mock or make a parody of their very own praised work as Lana does all the time here? Fells like she's taking the legacy she created with her sister Lily as a curse, and to make new movie interesting, previous ones must be trashed somehow.The pace is terrible and action sequences are misplaced all the time. The original was interesting because it was a cyberpunk action movie, with great doses of sci-fi, gaming culture references, dark humor, jaw dropping fighting scenes and one of the greatest unpredictable romance tales ever made leading entire story to another level, a combo that made it a true reference to the pop culture, so strong that it's impossible to be replaced. But now it's just a movie based on main characters' personal dramas full of empty quotes with the same love theme that's there only to justify once more why they are bonded to each other, messing with entire experience of the original. It's so boring to a point that 180 minutes of Cloud Atlas feels like a joy.They mock the success of bullet time effect, as if at any moment audience would be pleased with an amazing new experience. Instead, they use one of the worst camera effects ever made to dissociate time and space. The make up is also horrendous, and all the mythology created is entirely wasted.The acting is good, but never elevates the lack of arguments for one of the worst sequels I've ever watched. It's not even a movie that I could ignore its flaws and have some fun watching. If that makes pinnacle fans satisfied, it's pretty much obvious that ordinary audience does not feel the same because a movie does not survive only by easter eggs and hidden trophies. That does not make any movie remarkable, just annoying.",3
403,"I don't know if I should feel good or sad by the existence of this. As much as i loved to see Carrie Anne and Keanu back, as switch said in the first movie, not like this. I really disliked this movie. This ruined a otherwise perfectly executed trilogy, eventhough I didnt particularly enjoy revolutions, I always felt they ended it perfectly without ruineing it.This was a really sloppy take on the Matrix. The look and feel, the action sequences all were just downright bad. This was an insult to the original movies. This felt like technology went backwards. The original feels more current. As for the characters, the new morphious character was unbearable. What on earth was that. Sorry to say couldn't care about the rest of the cast either. It's unfortunate they had to be part of this. I wish Wachowsky took on another project as a grieving tactic. The only good thing about his was to see Carrie Anne and Keanu Reeves.",3
404,"It's like most of the core cast of characters who created the Matrix got back together to make a new movie but by copy pasting scenes from the previous movies. There are over a dozen instances of scenes either literally cut and pasted from prior films into this one or scenes completely ripped off from say, the first movie and redone in a less interesting fashion in this one. In fact, the entire movie feels that way, a less interesting, less epic version of the first one. Even the outfits look less cool.There was a strong and noticeable lack of new ideas in this film and it does not help that there is no Hugo Weaving or Lawrence Fishburne and frankly I do not think the film should have been made without them. Especially if you are going to keep the characters of Morpheus and Agent Smith, two of the more enjoyable personalities from the original three films. I'm sure their replacements are capable actors but they just do not feel the same as the originals. It's the same feeling I had when they replaced the oracle's actress in the third movie. It just doesn't cut it.Some dialogue is also cringeworthy such as random f-bombs where they are not warranted, almost everything Niobe says, and whatever the now weird looking Merovingian is saying about Mark Zuckerberg and Wikipedia.It's all very disappointing because, while forced, the Matrix Resurrections could have been a decent standalone movie. The problem is that it badly lacks a plot and due to that, it feels like 2 and a half hours of filler riffing off the previous 3 films for the content it wasn't able to provide.",4
405,Poor script poor performance from most of the cast including the soulless Keanu what a pile of junk. This movie is horrible and overhyped but the flock of zoomer sheeps.,1
406,"This film is bold and for that I've given it bonus points. It's part romance, part violence and quite a bit of filler.The film reminds me of a art house project with a big budget. It feels fragmented as it switches between a romance/drama and hardcore action flick. I found myself being bored by the characters - not caring about them or their plight. They added nothing to the story.If I had to describe what was fun, it was revisiting the first Matrix film, it was seeing a ""fan fiction"" film made by a wachowsky. It was seeing Neo and Trinity engaging each other. I also enjoyed Neil Patrick Harris with some of his dialogue - he was spot on at times.Overall, it's an OK film. It's too different from the original. It lacks thought provoking. The action scenes feel flat. The characters don't do much. The motives are not strong.I'd give it a go. Support the gamble taken in making this film: it's genuinely different. Just think romance with martial arts and it might help.Contains at least one graphic scene. Not recommended for squirmish teens.",6
407,"Irrelevant. Annoying. Boring.Avoid.1 * out of 10 (because there is no 0)Getting good old stuff, putting it in the microwave, selling as new and spoiling it... this produces maybe some cash, short term.

New faces were introduced , but new faces for some old characters like Morpheus and Smith was not acceptable . They did some work to bring back old Matrix feel in this movie , but it wasn't enough . Cast all done good work . I was bit happy to watch return of Neo and Trinity . Some of the action sequences were really good , especially in climax . Overall it felt like another asusual action Sci-Fi from Hollywood , an unnecessary sequel . It may disappoint Matrix fans .( Don't wait for Post credit scene , it was just stupid )",5
411,"It's basically a disney knockoff version of what matrix is. With all the technology and money behind this, they couldn't get proper actors to act and a proper cinematographer for shot choices.What the matrix trilogy is a philosophical scifi thriller. This movie on the other hand is basically a heist movie just with a loose matrix theme around it. Nothing about the movie is intelligent and similar level as the movie free guy with Ryan Reynolds. The only difference is free guy knows it's an action comedy genre.",1
412,"What made the Matrix such a big deal? It combined philosophical questions about the nature of our reality and free will, with guns and kung fu. The reason it worked was simply because even if you didn't care about anything other than the fight scenes, you could still enjoy it.This blatant cash grab featured nothing of those things. Bad fight scenes with too many cuts, out of focus gunfights, characters you didn't even remember their names, let alone care about what would happen to them.They tried to cash in on that nostalgia so hard, half the movie was the older movies in flashbacks.If you liked the trilogy, this movie never came out. Think of it as a surrealistic fan made attempt. Although, fans would have done a far better job.",2
413,"I'm writing this review on the same day I read that the movie is set to lose 100 million dollars for Warner Brothers. Wow! No matter how much I didn't like the movie, at least I'm not out 100 million dollars. I try to think if there was maybe a better way for Warner Brothers to lose 100 million dollars and I think this movie was a pretty reasonable way. I do wonder if they read the script before they greenlit the thing, and they said, ""We can't possibly lose more than 100 million dollars on this movie, so let's do it!"" And now they are patting themselves on the back because if they'd have lost any more than 100 million dollars somebody'd have some explaining to do. So, my recommendation is to not watch the movie, because on a scale of what this movie is worth to the average movie goer, I'd put it at right about minus 100 million dollars.",4
414,"I loved the mind trip of the first movie, the 2nd &amp; third were interesting in their own right but not as great as the first imho.I had no expectations for this reboot but hope to be entertained.It is mediocre at best &amp; at worse mind numbingly boring.Very predictable, cheap action scenes, &amp; woke but that is to be expected of movies coming out of trash Hollywood elitists.",5
415,"It's painful to watch and try to keep up with this bastardized version of the Matrix. It's similar to what I would imagine to be a schizophrenic's retelling of The Matrix. Don't unplug from the matrix, plug in instead? What?In a perfect world, this movie wouldn't exist. Keanu appears as if he knew this would be a terrible film. He took the money and just floated through the role with no passion. I mean, he's not the best actor, but he has absolutely no support here. The writers doomed it. The cast and direction took out the serious undertones that are essential to make a thriller like the matrix. It felt more like a bad Arnold Schwarzenegger film with the feeling that nothing is too serious and Arnold will cap the most serious scenes with a funny one-liner to lighten the mood. Nothing about the matrix trilogies were light. No comic relief like in this on. Poor attempts at comic relief are rampant throughout this handicapped script.The bounds of what can happen are limitless for the writers. Nothing makes sense. Emotionless, streaming-era mass production model films are the norm. This movie was no different. An absolute disaster that leaves a wake of cringeworthy, nostalgia-pandering destruction of the original film in its excruciatingly mediocre path.",1

There is maybe 2 hours of dialogue in this movie, and ... nothing relevant was said. Morpheus was smarter than Neo for skipping this this one, and allowing his character to be recast. Same with Agent Smith. The only reason this movie gets a '3', and not a '1', is because Keanu Reeves gets bonus points. I remember pausing the movie at one point, and realizing that there was somehow still way over an hour to go, and it depressed me even more. Avoid at all costs.",3

This guy LOOKS and ACTS softer than MICKEY MOUSE, yet he's playing the role of a guy who is a total badass. They literally cast the complete opposite of the SMITH we know and love from the previous movies. I miss that angry yet totally focused face that HUGO WEAVING was able to protray in the previous movies...Other than that, every aspect including the plot and actors are terrible. Another great franchise ruined for no good reason...",3
421,So the story line was saving neo and trinity for what reason? There's no war and the machine are at peace.Some of the lines and acting in the film are also shocking.Far as I'm concerned the matrix finishes at no 3.I'll take which ever pill erases my memory for this film not exsisting.,1
422,"WB wanted a cash grab, Lana delivers us this urgent messageWe pride the first Matrix on making us think long after viewing the movie. I was so disappointed in this movie*, and all I could think of was what went wrong, so it was at least within the same spirit. I took it upon my self to try and find out..My theory:The first portion of the movie explains everything, and it's not even veiled. Lana name dropped Warner Brothers, which came as a bit of a 'shock' to hear, which was exactly it's intention. In this moment Lana has effectively removed you from the movie*. This is done in order to speak to you in person. She had the following message, ""WARNER BROTHERS said they would do it without us...~"" Take note, the way in which this sentence is worded the 'shock' is delivered first. In this portion of the movie Lana is Neo (actually she's always Neo). Neo expresses how there's no story to be told, because after the trilogy, the story was complete, but when you're in that position you feel as though your Art, your Passion is being threatened, so you might as well take the reigns.I apologize beforehand if I'm wrong, but I really believe the cat went up this tree. I honestly feel that this movie was intentionally sabotaged, or just not really taken that seriously. I say that because if we're still assuming that Lana is Neo, and Neo feels as though there's no need for a Matrix 4. Yet he still has to make it anyway for some big corporation that wants cash grab (before the year's end). When art pieces are as personal as The Matrix is to the Wachowski's it can be rather insulting when someone bypasses all the meaning behind it just to make a quick buck. So after Lana uses the first act of the movie* to explain to you why the Matrix 4 doesn't need to exist, and the remaining acts she just eked out something that resembled a movie just to get it past those corporate morons (and it worked). All Within the first act Lana's statement is complete. You can turn the movie* off, because what follows is Lana demonstrating what happens when you don't respect the work of an artist.The fact that Lawrence Fishburne wasn't even contacted, and the decision to move forward without Hugo Weaving actually makes sense now. It was actually done out of respect for the two veteran actors.I believe Lana knew that this movie* would tank, If the movie didn't tank they'd just ask for another, and another, yet the story was already completed. Having the movie tank works in her favor, to lower the value of the franchise so that it would be less likely to be looked at in such a disgustingly greedy way. However I don't know how effect that will be, WB always has the option to, ""do it without us (Wachowskis),"" and perhaps a spinoff might save the franchise, but a franchise isn't what Lana wantsSo all the rage and anger actually works in her favor, because a lot of viewers are in agreement with Lana when they say, ""No more Matrix movies.""and Again if we're still assuming Neo is Lana, Neo never makes the Matrix 4. I believe this may hint to this movie* as not being a part of 'The Matrix' at all, which is why I used an asterisk when referring to this movie*.Lana this was a genius way to get your point across. Perhaps too genius.",10
423,I wanted to stop watching in the first 20 mins but decided to continue and god I wish I stopped. The whole movie seems like its a parody or a fan made youtube video. I have no idea how a writer who worked on all 3 previous movies directed such a horrible 4th.,3

Destroying this matrix series magic.Do like the amount of power the agent gotNEO just got too much power and overusing it, making only good Hollywood stunt/action moments.First it seems like they have overload of manpower and suddenly nonOf course, they make it a cliffhanger to be able to make another sequel.",2
425,"I'm torn, The Matrix is one of my top 10 favourite films, iconic and rule breaking. I remember the marketing at the time ""What is The Matrix?"" I didn't mind the two sequels but having now watched the fourth instalment I wonder, why was it made? A critic wrote that there is simply too much borrowed from the other films, agreed. So much is carried over and simply delivered via new special effects that do make it look better but that isn't good enough. Jonathan Groff is a standout and his action scenes with Keanu Reeves are brilliant. But why redo so many iconic scenes? Some footage actually looked a bit dodgy, with todays special effects it should have been of a very high standard. To me, it was like watching a movie made 20 years ago with some of todays special effects.",5

Never mind the nonsensical story, what I really don't get is whether this movie is more of a self indulgence or a cash grab. And the story really is incoherent and meaningless.The whole ""meta"" level that was, I guess, supposed to be cool is just sad and forced. Throwing around buzzwords as fast as you can does not make you sound smart, just pretentious.Fight scenes, one of the high points of the original Matrix, were terrible. They were over-choreographed to the point that they didn't look like fight scenes. The characters never looked like they were fighting, but like they were doing some kind of modern dance routine. Gunfights were also bad and never looked real.The acting was also sub par, and Keanu Reeves was probably the worst. He may well be the nicest person in the world, but he is a very limited actor and he just seems wooden in most of his scenes. In fact, the more he tries to make his acting meaningful and dramatic, the more wooden and forced it comes across.Add to this the unnecessary flashbacks and length of the movie and the obligatory wokeness that serves no purpose other than virtue signaling, and this movie really has no redeeming qualities.",3

436,We waited so long for the all time great comeback and this is the garbage we get. Even with the modern technology the CGI was aweful and dark. Action scenes were lame. Though there are some cool camera anglesAbout the characters:Bugs was not as convincing for the role of a captainThey literally made Morpheus a joke characterKeanu could've gotten a cool haircut and shave. This is Neo after all and shouldn't look like some old bumSmith? What is he even doing here? What's his purpose?Overall I wouldn't recommed to waste your money on this cash grab garbage and watch something meaningful.I myself better go back watch Jon Wick for satisfaction.,4
437,We made a movie deliberately bad because Warner Bros forced our hand. And we are so deep to tell you this in a movie. Also corporations bad but give them your money and red pill is not what you think but what we want you to think.,1
438,"A complete nothing burger with 'Do you remember this' from the original film, it felt like bad fan-fiction. I highly recommend you don't watch this film, it adds nothing to the franchise. It wasn't even shoot very well, just felt slapped together with no thought whatsoever, like Independence Day: Resurgence. (It you liked that, you'll love this) Honestly it was that bad.",1
439,"OMG the plot is garbage, it takes a huge dump on the Matrix lore. The trilogy is amazing and one of my all time favorites... this movie is utter garbage and should have never been made. Do your self a solid and stay away and pretend this movie does not exist. The orignal movies, the animatrix, the games..... it built this gorgeous cool world and mystified us. This is just taking a huge dump on everything.",1
440,"20mins in &amp; I was confused but when I figured it out, I lost all interest.This is just a love story with fight scenes.The amazing fight scenes from the first one (basically what we all remember) was nowhere here. The plot was ridiculous, the love story was pointless, the cameos from past characters where just confusing.Seriously. What was the point?Extremely underwhelming.",1
441,"Well I wasn't expecting it to be anywhere near awesome but this just turned out to be genuinely bad.. The old movies had a real story behind it but this one seemed like they simply didn't put any effort in it ..Previous movies had proper character development, but this movie was all about Neo and Trinity. Since when did they became so inseparable?The movie had the potential to become great if it had better actors to make up for the bad plot. That reminds me the acting was also not great... Neo himself has forgotten how to act like Neo. I know he forgot all about being The One which is common knowledge, but still I felt he was not very believable. Trinity however was fine but she barely had any screen time... And most importantly we were not shown the story from her perspective at all. It was important to know how things happened from her side. So many things remain unexplained like this movie is meant for small children who won't care for such details.. What a waste of time and money.There's a saying ""one and one is eleven"", when the Lana sisters worked together they produced some of the best movies of all times. Yet somehow I wonder the other sister knew this was coming and backed out. Even Lana was thinking of backing out midway and didn't wanted to finish the film (according to rumors) and the actors had to request her to finish the film. I guess this is what happens when they don't put their ""hearts in the work"". Who came up with such silly script anyway?Anyway, I'm used to old movies sequels being bad now. You can never produce a quality like prequels.Old is Gold is being proved again and again.",3
442,"It was fairly enjoyable right up until about 15 minutes until the end. Then it became completely awful, with female empowerment being shoved down your throat for no reason other than because they wanted to. They changed the formula and it was done with no respect for the prior films.At that point, the writing and the direction became so unserious, it was downright insulting. I very much wish I never watched it and simply maintained what I thought to be a very decent trilogy.",4
443,"Absolutely horrible nostalgia pandering cash grab that thinks because it makes fun of that premise, it's okay. It's not.It was a pointless badly written movie that adds nothing.Typical.Stop attaching your talentless drivel to classic works and leeching off of them. You failed. As predicted.",2
444,"Thankfully I have HBO and didn't have to pay ticket price to watch a movie about how much neo loved trinity and how great she really is. Who green lights this crap. I'm all for a female forward movie. But for the love, make the story interesting. What's next...diehard remake movie re-cast with female lead?",3

446,"I saw the movie as a big fan of all the Matrix franchise. The entire universe around the first movie was always consistent (from the game to the animatrix shorts), so I was expecting something that would keep the pace with the previous ones.Nope. This movie is really a joke (literally, you can forget the seriousness of the trilogy) as it makes a parody of itself.It lays between a parody and a love story with a pinch of reunion, all packed as a feature film.Curious to see that all 9/10 and 10/10 reviews comes from one review only accounts.This explain more than anything else about the movie.",4
447,"I can't believe this film came from the same minds as The Matrix.Maybe they ran out of ideas? Or perhaps passion?Or perhaps their prior successes left them without proper oversight?Whatever happened, this film is hot garbage.Generic, forgettable characters, convoluted &amp; confused plot with dozens of holes.Messy, unfocussed, poorly choreographed &amp; badly edited action sequences.*sigh* Yet another beloved Hollywood IP ruined with a worthless cash grab.",3
448,"Pitifully weak script, wooden actors, clueless and pointless action scenes, childish dialogues. This movie is an INSULT to the viewers. It feels like the creators assumed that cinema crowds are a bunch of morons and they will just gratefully swallow anything. Shame on you a-holes.",1
449,"This movie is completely unnecessary to the Matrix world as sometimes it doesn't even feel like a Matrix movie. If not for the many original trilogy flashbacks sometimes I though I was seeing some king of John Wick 3.5 or any other sci-fi-action movie with Keanu Reeves. His performance is forgetable and sometimes looks like he's parodying himelf. The rest of the cast never got my attention, neither the story, and I have to be honest. I felt the story to be so bad and uninteresting that I had to use my smartphone a lot to avoid sleeping.I'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie but be ready for nothing like the original trylogy in any item you can rate a movie. Not even the fight scenes are good as they are badly choreographed and filmed, and the special effect are just the same as any other 2021 movie. Nothing special here.I had low expectations but this is even worse then I was prepared to.",
450,"Admittedly, I was never a huge fan of any previous Matrix movies, but the first was (and always will be) the best of the bunch. I think what killed it for me was how the ""bullet time"" effects were copied and overused by every subsequent movie and TV show for probably at least the next 5+ years afterward.Regardless, unlike the other sequels (that actually tried to be something, at least) this is just a pointless sequel/cash grab. I gave it a serious 30 minute chance on HBO Max and then just shut it off. Anyone seeing this in a theater, I actually feel sorry for you.The effects are stale, the plot is pointlessly nonsensical, and the stupidest part is the fact that it's so blatantly self-aware and self-nostalgic. There's a scene fairly early where Neo is working for a video game company and they are having a meeting about what made The Matrix games (huh, what?) exciting, thus naming off things like ""guns, lots of guns"" and ""bullet time"" and a slam (?) at Warner Bros that is so blatantly obvious it just made me say ""wow, really?"". If this were a comedy, I could accept it, but unlike the far superior Joker this film is just a tragedy.Replacing Laurence Fishburne and the ""new"" Agent Smith with someone who doesn't even remotely act like either of them was a bad choice as well. The other actors seem like they are bored and are just phoning it. Combine all that with the stereotypical shooting of nameless small armies of people in suits or tactical gear and it's just a ho-hum rehash.For way more fun with Keanu Reeves, go check out any of the John Wick movies, give this one a hard pass, and take the pill that makes you forget you ever tried to see it.",1
451,"Twice as long as it needs to be. It's a self indulgent mess that tries too hard to be clever and Meta, yet fails at both. With better editing, cutting down the first hour and a half, expanding the world outside the machine world along with fleshing out things with more than just one line to explain things such as ""x y Z just disappeared"" this may have been a decent movie. Heard people snoring and saw several sleeping during the first hour.Oh yes, the post credits scene is a nice little skit/outtake.Honestly, this is one of the poorest movies I've seen in a long time.",2
452,"The original films were about challenging reality, drawing heavily on philosophy, but this film was just a (spoilers ahead) love story. That's it, just Neo rescuing Trinity because they got caught. No real Morpheus--a new fake, no real antagonist--Hugo Weaving replaced by actors I guess they didn't have to pay much. And as precious as Doogie Howser is in everything he does, he's far too cheesy a villain. He should stick to musicals. No real plot, no real challenge to the establishment, or the mind. Just a way to reboot the franchise to those who were in diapers when the originals were made. # boring.",2
453,"Basically the story of the Matrix ended by 3rd installment however this saga remains the most relevant one for promoting for virtual realities which is getting all the hype at the moment so they had to unseal that coffin .Despite it kept people dazzled of what exactly are they seeing let me briefly explain :They had to instate the Matrix is still running for the open world game take over from thereThey had to introduce the concept of Bots (NPCs) for that the morality of killing real people trapped inside a virtual reality is always bad but killing bots is ok for game playThey increased the number of villains so you are no longer being haunted by two or three agents manifesting the bodies of others but a whole horde of villains you can get kill frenzy atTrinity gets super powers too as the main lead of the game is a female mind you they wanted to instate that its not a man's world any more for the open world multiplayer to attract females as wellBut here is what they actually throw at you watching this movie :Very incoherent storyThe idea of the enormous fire power the Bots shoot at Neo's gang gets you pissed at how they all miss , judging that they are being fired by a governing AI that powerful and supposedly mathematically accurateThere is no green anymore , they removed the green filter or made it lite , I am not sure but that alone made it feel less related to the MatrixThe new AI running the Matrix is so powerful yet he keeps sparing Neo just for the story to continueTrinity gets to have more powers than Neo for the new wave of girls power movies despite her being out of the loop for so long mind you no valid explanation is given for that particular detailNo character development what so ever with Neo's gang , they are just faces you see shooting around where they sometimes even change those faces and introduce new ones without explanation (Maybe that cast you remember had a day off that day)",1
454,"There wasn't a red tread through the movie, there was a ball of yarn that somebody had set on fire.There was points where we would laugh out loud, not because of the comedy that was inserted into the movie, but because of silly things on screen, mistakes, bad CGI and plotholes. There is a moment in this movie where a helicopter disappears completely for like 2-4 min, only to return right where it should have been all the time, so it again can shoot at the main actors, it made no sense but someone must have forgot it was there from the start.Like I said this is more like a spoof movie of the Matrix, it really has no connection that makes sense to the old movies, and the story isn't moved forward in any meaningful way. A hero journey is also only as good or interesting as the villain in the story, and here they are all bad, it's more bad boys in a ally than a threat you feel could be a actual problem.",

457,I wish I could unwatch this one. They really ruined my childhood memories. This spinoff was bad in every aspect. Now I am really scared watching John Wick 4 if and when it comes out as this is all seemingly cash grab in the guise of promising entertainment. Hopefully they don't do this to LOTR. Shame on WB for wasting our time.,2
458,"This film could not exist without the original film/s as context. Any interpretation of this movie as something other than a speedy, vapid, nostalgia bait cash grab aiming to ride the wave of Keanu Reeves' reignited popularity is simply wrong.I think the director herself makes it abundantly clear within the text of this movie that she believes it is wholly unnecessary. I believe the first conversation about her doing this movie would have gone ""either you direct, or someone else will"".Stick to the original trilogy.",3
459,"I'm a huge fan of the first movie so I tolerated the 2nd and 3rd. But this was pointless. The movie started out okay but quickly devolved into random fight scenes and endless dialogue about the past and wanting to be free and yada yada yada. There was no plot other than to free Trinity from the matrix, and that took 2 hours. It seemed like one big setup for more sequels. Like more corporate greed.",5
460,"I'm not trying to defend M:R. It's godawful. However, hear me out. I think it was made on purpose.There are at least 2 OBVIOUS dialogues about Matrix 4 and what Wachowski thinks of it.First was when devs were stormbraining ideas for M4 (literally saying Warner Bros will do it either we want it or not), while another one when Merovingian (program from M3) kept on blabbering in middle of the combat.I am damn certain Wachowski did everything she can to make this movie as bad as possible, while still getting a green light for relase. It's supposed to kill off any possible sequels after M4.So I believe M4 is the best at doing the worst, literally a 10/10 in being 1/10.Don't watch it for your wallets sake. Not worth it. It was meant to be bad.Also, damn, whoever made the trailer for M4 is evil genius making THIS movie look quite good.",1

462,"Remember everything you loved about the original Matrix (and even the sequels)? Well, forget every single thing of them, as you're not going to see it in this one.In the original series you had memorable action sequences that defied the norms....and Ressurections replaces them with poorly shot / edited / choreographed garbage.In the original series you had one of the greatest villains ever (Agent Smith) in cinema that stole every single scene involved in....and Ressurections replaces him with a Chad.In the original series you had the frightening and depressing realisation the real world was a dark, cold, lifeless existence with unforgiving sentinels covering every inch of the surface....and Ressurections replaces that with a somewhat pleasant Krypton type world where humans enjoy peace and high-five their machine friends. No, I'm serious. They literally high five machines in this film.In the original series you had intimidating agents that gave you the sense of immenent danger....and Ressurections replaces them with zombies lol.Honestly, I feel like this was a deliberate abomination of a much loved franchise. For what reason, I will never know.But one thing I do know, is that if they ever hope to make a redeemable title again, this needs to be taken away from the Wachowski sisters (or whichever one that worked on this) - who, at this point, aren't capable of making a good Matrix film again. Give it to a new fresh director.",3
463,"Let this travesty stand as a warning to all well-accomplished actors that you need not waste your time taking roles in crap projects like this. Keanu Reeves must have lost his mind to sign up for this circus while he's got a booming career and the John Wick franchise still going hot! The only reason this movie exists is because a has-been Wachowski and a brainless studio (WB) think even less of the franchise's fans than they do themselves! Just picture the worst case scenario and trust me you'll get exactly that! Posers, decrepit old people, a wishy-washy echo chamber for ""the message,"" no story what so ever, horrible fight scenes, and that's it and that's all folks!",1
464,"SPOILERS AHEAD.There is a scene very early in the movie where the write explicitly tells you that the movie is going to be a soulless cash grab. Like its so obvious you don't need literature skills to pick up the metaphor.Two characters are talking to each other about the Matrix as a videogame, they even mention Warner Brothers as the parent company and then go on to practically tell you the movie is going to be a cheap rehash.I don't know why so many writers/directors think breaking the 4th wall is so innovative. It's not. It just shows a lack of creativity.News flash, just because you break the 4th wall and complain about Hollywood in your movie...it doesn't make your movie any better, or excuse you from being apart of the same hollywood faults that you mention in your movie.After that scene, half of the rest of the runtime is made up of flashbacks.... I kid you not. The flashbacks happen so often, there is even a scene where the characters are about to re-enact a scene from the 1st movie WHILST THEY ARE WATCHING IT ON A BIG SCREEN....that's not being creatively meta....that's just lazy writing.If the original writer was that unmotivated to make the film, then she should have done the honorable thing and left.",1
465,"Why was this made? The only answer can be money. Couldn't be to answer the unanswered, because it doesn't. Couldn't be to finish the unfinished, because it was already finished.I'll admit...i wanted another Matrix. To see Neo et al fight again to free humanity. To see him do superhuman things amd fight in bullet time. To see what happened after he was reinserted. Did he die? Was humanity freed? Did anyone actually choose to be released? Were they even told the truth and given a choice?Sadly the Wachowskis decided none of that was important. None of the lore mattered. None of the heart and soul that was created mattered. None of the original magic mattered. They literally turned it into a video game mockery of itself. They not only castrated Neo and took away all his power and intrigue, but also every world element they built in the 1st place.There was nothing new, and they ruined everything old. The original trilogy was ripe with brilliant character acting and well thought out scripts for everyone. I actually cared about each character, both good and evil, and felt like I knew them. There was philosophy and thought provoking ideas to match the state of the art special effects (""Why do you persist?"")Resurrections was bereft of all of it, especially a soul, and i couldn't wait until it ended. Apparently the machines created this movie.Shame on the Wachowskis.",1
466,"I get it. It's been 18 years and we're not sure if Trinity died and whether Neo's sacrifice saved humans from future wars. There had to be a storyline about getting back to that past in order to save the present, but this installment was lackluster, empty, boring, and could not improve upon the witty dialogue nor the action and fighting choreography of the past Matrix films. There was this incessant need to replay clips from the past - this made the cheese factor skyrocket to 10. The fighting scenes were pedestrian at best, the Architect 2.0 with Neil Patrick Harris is super annoying with elementary dialogue, Agent Smith not really Agent Smith, and where is the bad-ass plugged-in Matrix ensemble - this ensemble was weak? Trinity can fly? That was some quick non-existent programming she had undergone towards the end. This movie was better left on the shelf to preserve the integrity of the franchise, not present itself for some quick holiday bucks. It was frustrating to watch.",3
467,"Was not expecting anything and still go disapointed, I had to fight my desire to stop watching, yes, it is that bad.All the subtext from the first Matrix is now thrown at your face and if that's not enough the movie will rub it in some more without even a care in the world for the 4th wall.While the 2 novies before were not as good as the original ones they were, at least, competent action movies. This one is not, close 2nd worst movie of 2021 for me after Resident Evil Welcome to Racoon City.",3
468,"Why Ms. Wachowski? Why, why? Why did you shoot this parasitic and humiliating the trilogy sequel? Solid self-repetitions, especially the love story of Neo and Trinity, which was already fundamental in the trilogy. All this meta starts to get boring after half an hour. The new characters are miserable. Terrible acting of Keanu, he looks so tired here. Trinity talks like a robot. Morpheus and his humor makes only a cringe. The new Smith is not a marker to Hugo. There is no action, the usual poorly filmed fights, with terrible editing. No hint of the epicness of the previous films. The whole meaning of the previous parts is destroyed. SPOLIER. Machines are now growing strawberries, lol. The new architect says that the previous one was wrong with his mathematical algorithms)) Neo and Trinity were resurrected to stupidly use as batteries. Trinity is the new chosen one. What??? For some reason, machines are at war with each other like there is no AI to ryle them))This all reminds me a South park episode with Indiana Jones and Lucas.",4
469,"First of all i have to say That matrix is my childhood idol. Every icon in the former series is sacred to me. I can say i choose my job over matrix. After the forat movie many of my friends crituqued two and three but the whole story was something i cant give up on so far. Today i watched the ressurections. I have few disapointments. Some are technical, some are contextual. Here they are:why the action camera stands in the characthers ass? The acton camera is sometimes so close that you basically see some arms and legs thats lt. Some combat sceenes are too crowded that it is hard to spot who is hitting who!In the sofware company, Anderson is delusional, he is in pain, but rather than we are exposed to his pain as audiance, we are choked by the tictocish parody running around him. Comapred to the noir atmosphare that we had in the first thrilogy, colorful characthers running around. Same for Morpheus, the solid sound of wisdon and belif in the first trilogy became a guy of joy and cheer. As if that is not enough, he has fun with morpheus's seriousness and philosophical way of talking. He litterally says bla bla bla to the words where morpheus explains his perspective of reality in the fist movie.Why Smith is still alive? Why he is helping Neo infront of the analyst is explained but for me far fetchedWhat makes neo special in the first three movie was his ability to see every code including matrix in source codes, wirh that ability, it is not possible to imprison him with another code. The only code he could not see the source was seraph. In this one, he sees the code but still somewhat can not hack it in a way to even fly!My concerns go and on... but still it was still so good to see my childhood belowed. I would go again even if i knew i will feel the same!",5
470,"As many others, I had thought that the previous Matrix instalments weren't much worthy. But this one completely transcends it. Everything you need to know about the movie is contained in its ending. It is just as ridiculous and nonsensical as one would predict if expecting the worst of this latest attempt of the Matrix revival. And yet it is even worse. It seems at some point, the writers completely ran out of ideas and even money to physically shoot some scenes at the end. Instead they inserted a ridiculous CGI generated scene at the end, where you could easily see that Neo and Trinity are not real anymore. And then came the completely absurd ending scene that abruptly ended the movie.",3

Pathetic storyline, pathetic script, pathetic acting (even Keanu was sleepwalking), pathetic cable-fu, pathetic camera work... You get the idea.It should've been a ""straight to DVD"" release, starring Dolph Lundgren as Agent Smith. Yes, it's Lundgren level bad. Don't waste your time and money in theaters, wait for it to be released as a late night cable entertainment and watch it only when you're bored to tears but playing with yourself is not an option for some reason.",1
475,"CONTAINS SPOILERS****************************Trinity and Neo are arbitrarily resurrected in order to somehow control the matrix while being denied happiness by Doogie Howser who is now in charge I guess.But that is not saying much. It is so convoluted, slow, tedious, and honestly stupid that you will be begging for it to end.For a bit of meta/4th wall destruction - Neo is a game designer who designed a game called Binary (a trilogy of games!) where his past (from the first trilogy of movies) is still in his dreams and foggy memories and put into the game as storyline. The characters in the story are constantly questioning why sequels and trilogies are made and are unecessary, and I could not agree more by the end of this movie.During this romp the annoying French guy from the 2nd and 3rd films pulls a Statler and Waldorf, heckling Neo from above and doing absolutely nothing else and without consequence. This is going on while Neo and gang fight some other people that don't matter - but this is where Neo is confronted with Agent Smith again who wants to stop Neo so he can get what he wants... somehow.Morpheus has many uneventful and needless scenes, and the origin of his younger avatar is such a convoluted and ridiculous mess that you will hate them for not inviting Fishburne back as an aged half bionic man in Zion.But Zion died because they don't like machines even though they used advanced machines the entire time in the first trilogy. AI machines are now being used as scientists and whatnot in Io which replaced good ol Zion.One could say they just don't like AI - but it seems in Io all this got them was strawberries and (presumably) blueberries that the synthentient scientists helped them create (Synthient? Sorry - I stabbed my frontal lobe with an Apple TV remote to forget much of this movie afterward so please forgive me). But Zion is stupid for wasting the potential future of candied fruits and berries for the very ""irrational"" fear that sentient machines would be a bad thing in the universe of this film.Wrapping up as to not spoil everything - This film puts the audience into a position to feel the entire first trilogy did not change anything save for Io which now has strawberries and sentient synthetic lab workers - FOR THE WIN! The sacrifice that Neo and Trinity made was basically for nothing and the whole war with the machines solved nothing, unless it is positing that the initial prophecy and story was only the beginning and now the real ending to the pophecy is to come in this next trilogy. At least until the next trilogy that is.",2

Unfortunately this 4th reiteration fell short of the original by ten folds. A reboot that failed in everything possible. The re-hash of what it did 20+ years ago made matters worse, because it couldn't reproduce or re-create the magic it once did. Bullet time was cool, but the way they implement it in this movie was bad. I blame it on directing, the lack of cinematography work. A lot was lacking in this movie that made me feel hype for any of the action sequences, or care about the lines delivered by the actors. I set no expectations for this movie, and it failed to please as a stand-alone movie itself. Other recent movies like Shangh-Chi did a much better job at capturing action sequences. No point of creating a 4th installment, other than a huge cash grab. The script and story was horrible, how dare it took 20+ years to come up with it.",1

Very unremarkable and forgettable, as I mulled over not even finishing it. Just goes to show you what work culture driven by a female director can do to an amazing trilogy. Shameful. And shame on John Wick for thinking he could play Neo.",3
483,"Both Matrix 2 and 3 were are just about two decade old, and the original Matrix even older. The makers of #4, ""Resurrection"", don't really believe that people can remember that far back, do they? Maybe that is what they are counting on. This fourth, and hopefully last of the franchise does not live up to what its title suggests. It is merely an attempt to repackage the old material, and a feeble one as such.The first Matrix received a great deal of compliment on its originality. The idea of humans going into the computer is, however, hardly original, if you have seen movies like Tron (1982). Indeed, Matrix packages this idea into a pseudo philosophical trip, but the accent here is pseudo. The beauty (very literally) of Matrix is in the choreographed action sequences, as well as the stylish and cool art direction.In fact, the Matrix trilogy borrows freely from Asimov's classics: Zion City is a variation of the Caves of Steel while the idea of a super computer running human beings was created decades ago, in Asimov's ""Multivac"". Still, it would be unfair not to recognize the success of the original: it dazzled. The two sequels, however, do not have much additional to offer. There is, however, one scene that is still vivid in my mind after two decades, so much that I enjoyed it. I am talking about the stunning battle - the attack of Zion in ""Matrix 3"", which is back to basics.The scene is well set up, with preliminaries such as marshalling of hardware, brief coverage of each of the characters taking part, etc, etc. The strategy is clearly set out, from the full-blast, head-on assault the moment the shield has been broken (drilled, to be exact) through to the last heroic stand at the entrance of the temple. The parallel action line of the Niobe's (Jada Pinkett Smith) ship is also given due recognition. To the cynics, I'd say: yes, we've seen all these before. The mechanical colossus shaped fighters are expanded versions of the mechanical loaders that Sigourney Weaver drove to blast the 'bitch' into space in Aliens. Come to think of it, the metallic swamping squids are not unlike the metallic crawling creatures in Aliens. Niobe's ship running the impassable passage is really Luke Skywalker in Star Wars running the gauntlet again. Some may even say that you can get all these in a video game lounge. However, I'm not going to let these observations deter me from full enjoyment of this thirty minutes of spectacular visual audio extravaganza, plus the good old fashion good-against-evil sentiment going back to Star Wars, Spartacus, as well as forward to Return of the King. Best of all is fiercely beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith, on whose performance alone the level of this sequence, and possibly the entire movie, is raised several notches.I know, I still haven't said a single thing about ""Resurrection"". Well, here it is. And I may as well start with Niobe, who appears one hour into the movie, when the story really starts. Still portrayed by Jada Pinkett Smith, she is now an old woman. This sort of thing usually provides opportunities for make-up artists' Oscar bids. I understand that the job has been taken over by computers, be it aged-forward here, or age-backward as for Michael Douglas in ""Ant-man"".Niobe intimates to Neo during their initial conversation ""I did not believe a world without war is possible. You gave us that."" But peace did not last long because ""nothing can beat violence like scarcity"" and machines at war themselves. Amidst the regurgitation of pseudo philosophy and unnecessarily complicated events, the main plotline is straightforward. Neo has been resurrected while Trinity is still in a state of flux. His mission is to bring her back to life so that they can live happily ever after.Amidst all the talk and action, humor is not entirely lost. Working on his Bill Murray style deadpan, Reeves delivers a couple of punchlines like ""I still know kung fu"" and ""Yeah, that's not happening (that is, his flying ability).""Other than Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Jada Pinkett Smith, the cast is new, playing either old characters or entirely news. Top of the latter is punky looking resistance lass Bugs, played by Jessica Henwick, the loveliest (though not the horniest) of the three Sand sisters in Game of Thrones. Morpheus is no longer Fishburn but Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who ""Watchmen"" fans will fail to recognize from that TV series as the alien husband of Regina King's character. The role of Mr. Smith has been taken over by Jonathan Groff who has recently delivered a brilliant, unforgettable performance as King George in ""Hamilton"" (2020).",
484,"One of the worst movie i ever seen in my entire life, basically lana just wrote some jokes and ideas and made it as a movie, the ending is one of the most funny material in history of HollywoodSave your time and don't watch it otherwise you will make your day so badMy matrix trilogy ratingMATRIX 10/10Matrix Reloaded 8/10Matrix Revolution 7/10.",1
485,"My main emotion after managing to watch this entire film was disappointment, what could of been!It was utterly pathetic, the acting from almost every member of the cast was pitiful, it was like a badly scripted bottom of the bargain basket game nobody wanted.The storyline was pathetic and clearly so rushed and lazily put together it wasn't even worthwhile trying to comprehend the parts you couldn't hear because the actors were talking so fast or so quiet.It was good to see Keanu back as Neo ( sort of ) and Carrie back as Trinity ( sort of ) but even still they didn't play it very well and it was so bit parted between them it wasn't even done on purpose. 100% avoid this garbage.",1
486,"I didn't enjoy the story, I could think of so many better ways to re-introduce the matrix to ""Neo"" and the Audience. They do remember films are meant for the entertainment of the audience right?I mean we were all excited to see Neo and Trinity return, being played by the actors that made them who they are, and many of us were sad that Laurence Fishburne didn't reprise his role as Morpheus. But now after still giving it a chance, I can say it's not the matrix I love and remember, yet many of the characters appear to be there at least in name.For starters I would have done the whole re-hire all the old actors, including Agent Smith and Morpheus,and then told the story again from Morpheus perspective once again, trying to ""bring the one"" out of the Matrix and back to reality, ""Zion"" I guess the director just gave up on the whole Zion concept and left some cranky old lady to explain what things are now.I hate the direction the story went in those aspects, there was some great points, humans working with machines, and so many holes in the story.Like I wish I could sit down and re-write the entire thing and be like okay here is where we left off, here is where we are moving forward, because It feels like the directors and writers didn't do that.The fill in characters seem good, but they should have been introduced to the story differently, the audience knows who neo and trinity are, did they consider that there has been films made before this? Like maybe we should have had the backstory on who some of these other people are that supposably have been searching for neo for 70 years.. or something, anyway I'm so done with this movie it doesn't know what it is anymore, it's lost it's way, probably as a reflection on how the director has also lost his or her identity, since the making of the first matrix film.",1
487,Just a totally unnecessary sequel that comes off like it was made for TV with a low budget.It reeks of streaming content for the sake of content.Doogie was a poor casting choice compared to the architect and Smith was pointless.Ultra disappointed!!,5
488,"For someone who was a little boy when the first Matrix came out, I am quite disappointed with this one. I wasn't expecting a cinema defining movie as the first one, but damn the director really loose her touch.First, the storyline is really dull, second VFX is dramatic but kinda outdated in my opinion. Also, I understand you're using UE5 a lot, but this is still a technology supposed to be used in games. Everything seems like a video game, with little to no real stunts at all.",3
489,There are only three movies in Matrix Trilogy. This doesn't exist for me.. The Matrix was good when men were in charge. From acting to casting to effects to sound design and the color correction? Matrix has green tones.. this movie is color correction is so bad that i can't even explain. I love keanu but he acted so badly in it. It was worse then a cash grab. I don't know how many times i have to watch previous movies to get this one out of my head.. SKIP it while you can.,4
490,"Unfortunately a big disappointment. The scrip is really weak... and the dialogues are sometimes really, really bad... It is a soft reboot/nostalgia concept of old good movies...And wayyyy tooo much cut's in fighting scene.It might have been better if warner bros didn't let Lana Wachowski make the film...",3
491,"The Matrix was part of my philosophy curriculum (connecting Jean Baudrillard) in Undergrad engineering school. The film changed filmmaking with tints, cool black clothes, philosophical questions, a storyline which needed brains to understand and which had unbelievable action sequences. The film was made so well that above average actors like Reeves, Moss, Fishburne and Weaving became almost geek legends. It became a cult.Resurrections is a mockery of what the first film stood for. While all of these films seem like a philosophy discourse in the mind of the Wachowskis, this one fails miserably as simply a badly made film. The story actually isn't too bad but the execution seems like that of a 'spent' filmmaker. The issues start with casting. Chopra, Mateen, Groff, Henwick &amp; NPH seem like the proverbial fish out of water. How can one take NPH seriously in a philosophical film when he's Doogie or a stoner from Harold &amp; Kumar for millennials, and Barney for GEN Z.The movie strayed from its winning formula. In the time of Marvel and Wick, the action sequences needed evolution. The CG was below industry standard and frankly, Reeves and Moss are badly used. Groff was a decent choice but came off as a jock, as opposed to an Agent.The editing was odd and the starting sequence was a yawn. All in all, it was a boring film and perhaps Lana herself needs a reboot. She will always be the great maker of Matrix, but its perhaps not to think of it as a tetralogy.",4
492,"This was tough to watch. Lots of good ideas to build off of, but none of them executed well enough to result in a cohesive movie.The story line and pace was ""yawn worthy"" and not interesting enough to keep you fully engaged.Believe me, I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't... Even with a few, and I mean a few decent special effects does not a good movie make. This was disappointing, and in the most basic description.... I got absolutely zero chills or goosebumps from any of the action-packed sequences... No kind of emotional reaction whatsoever. Missed the mark, big-time!",3
493,"This was an absolute snoozefest. The 'comedy' was excruciating painful to watch. Of course, the change in certain characters and their demeanour, the 99% flashbacks, and the focus on the love story, are all thankfully are hated upon. Its a 2/10 but really a 1/10 pathetic cash grab that was outperformed by sing 2. Rightfully so.",2
494,"...and there goes another classic movie franchise turned to trash. Many bad fighting sequences, a freaking flying dolphin with legs? Come on...Boring, rushed, not the kind of movie I spected as the trilogy follow up.Post-credit scene was the worst insult.",3
495,What a shame. This is a real snoozer. I was so looking forward to this reboot. The story was hard to follow and the dialogue was just long winded babbling.,3
496,"I was really excited and expecting the movie premiere...still I went in with very low expectations, just to NOT get disappointed, just because sequels usually don't work out that well; and even with my preparation, I was actually almost depressed to see how they destruct Neo's EVERYTHING! At the beginning it looks fine with a destiny, then it gets more and more boring...no seat's edge in any part of the movie...what a disappointment! Keanu, you shouldn't have accepted this role, it's not who you represent.",3
497,"How would like Matrix exchanging Morpheus by the The Mask Character and Agent Smith for a tennis-playing prince of Monaco type of guy? Overly complex screenplay bordering the absurd. Really disappointed. This was the last Matrix movie I watched. Do not waste your time, you WILL be disappointed.",4
498,This movie is literally a recycled version of the first movie. Most of the movie consists of footages from the first movie and some terrible acting. It's a snoozefest and the writing was very poor. Don't waste your money and wait for it to come out on netflix or prime video if you wanna give it a shot.,1
499,"Terrible acting, terrible special effects, terrible cinematography.This was just so cheesy, not due to the underlying story, but due to the acting and the way the movie is filmed. None of the moodiness and style of the original, it just felt very low budget and disappointing.",3
500,"Never a good sign when a movie make you feel drowsy, but maybe I'm wrong since I haven't seen the whole thing yet , though I don't intend on watching the rest because the first half of this movie just wasn't very good at all.",5
501,"Abandon all logic, ye who choose to watch Resurrections. This plot hole riddled sequel of a sequel offers zero world building. It cheaply rehashes everything we loved from the first movie but tries to pass it off as meta.Characters make fun of 'bullet time' and then spend half the movie engaging in 'bullet time' and fist fights. It's attempts at self reference and satire falls flat. Outside of the three main characters, acting is wooden and lacking in charisma.Being forced to make a sequel by the studio is not a justification to make a bad movie. If you don't have the talent to write a fresh script, don't. This money grab further sullies the legacy of of the original. Don't see it in theaters. The only way these studios learn is through losing money.",3
502,"So many, many things could have been done in relation to the complex story surrounding the creation of the Matrix system itself and how that all went awry and enslaved humanity.Remember The Animatrix, remember how that dealt with some of that backstory with a few very nice short animated stories?Remember how you thirsted for more of that, but ended up with more of the same shooty shooty run run?Remember how they chucked that out in 2003 in a desperate cash grab when they could have kept those cards close to their chest and used them years later for this?Imagine how they could have blown away an entirely new audience with a new aspect to the story from a an entirely different perspective.But no, we have this.Oh well. Thanks, I guess.",2
503,So it's quite good if it's a hishe parody or something. I'm even surprised to see they spent million dollars just to make a parody. Now I'm curious when will they make the actual movie. But if this was actually the real movie and not parody then man Wachowski's just do something once and leave it. Because as they continue to do any film or tv show they just make it worse and worse. Films because they are making worse and worse. They just live by their success on their first Matrix and I'm amazed how production companies still supports them with their terrible stories. I'm not gonna even get into how cheesy the story is and how terrible are the actors and everything is forced into the film.,1
504,If this movie had a different name you wouldn't even suspect it was the 4th movie in Matrix franchise. A cash grab thats banking on people's nostalgia.,2
505,"I already wasn't hyped for a 4th Matrix film, as I personally deemed it unnecessary. 1 honestly was enough, let alone 3. And The Matrix is one of my favorite films. I'll start with what I liked: Keanu Reeves, Carrie Ann Moss, Jessica Henwick (she was the best in the movie in my opinion) and the VFX were good. Certain interior shots looked nice. Also, a cameo from an actress who was on Family Matters made my day. She's probably my favorite thing about this movie out of personal bias. But now, for the other side of the coin. I really don't like this movie at all. This movie seems to want to be a commentary on Hollywood reboots and a Matrix movie at the same time, but not merely in an allegorical sense. It does so directly at times. It's very meta to the point where it's immersion-breaking. There is literally a fight scene in this movie where there's some fool standing off in the distance above everybody ranting and raving about how movies and art overall used to be better in the past as opposed to now (which I don't really disagree with). I was put off by this entirely. Either be a reboot commentary movie or be The Matrix, but do not be both. It's not like that all the way through, but enough for me. Also, while I think Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is a talented actor I wasn't huge on his iteration of Morpheus, and yet I don't really fault him for that. I just felt like he was trying to be a little too cool and hip, but I understand that maybe he just wasn't trying to completely copy Laurence Fishburne. Just me, I guess. I thought Jonathan Groff was alright as Smith, but he's no Hugo Weaving. The action in this movie, particularly the hand-to-hand fighting is not well filmed at all. There were times where you couldn't even see actual collisions being made. And that's when there is action going on by the way, because there's not that much. There's quite a bit of talking, which I get why that's needed of course. But sometimes I was just bored. And without giving away everything about the approach that the writers took with this film in regards to the more meta stuff, they ended up doing some of the things if not all of the things they criticize other reboots for. This movie wants to be so clever with that, and it's not in that regard. It's just messy. Self-aware to a fault. I felt like they would have been better off making a separate movie about how ridiculous these reboots are. Maybe if they made a super scathing movie about that, it could be good. I say that now because stripping the commentary out, the sum of the movie's parts is just underwhelming on its own. For all that I just sat through and witnessed, I'm not convinced that there was more to this story. If anything this movie was just its own PSA that things should just be left alone after a while.",5
506,"I give this movie 3 stars for the special effects and some good scenery. Everything else worth 0 stars, plain and simple. It was a pain watching it, not only it is the worst Matrix movie ever made, I think it is very close to being the worst movie of 2021 overall. People that have not seen the original matrix will not understand what is going on at all, the flashbacks to the original movie do not help, and in fact makes this movie look like a film school project or a homage rather than an actual film. The absorbent length of 2 and a half hours is just incomprehensible and make it very hard to sit through it, somewhat of a torture really.The worst thing about the Matrix Resurrections is the incomprehensible plot, some crazy things happen for no reason, everything is possible, it's a game it's a dream, its the matrix, but in fact it is just ridiculous. The second thing is the feeble attempt to create a connection to the original matrix and replace the cast with some low-life talent. I felt ashamed watching the attempt to replace Morpheus, agent smith, trinity and others, and rehashing the same old scenes, like the fight, the matrix wake-up. The acting is just embarrassing, it's a complete disgrace to the Matrix franchise, and to the Hollywood movie industry as a whole.Bottom line: I have no idea how this movie is rated this high on IMDB. It is one of this movies that should have never been made. Complete money grab, lack of originality and talent. I can't urge you enough not to feed the machine with your Dollars, it is really that bad. Exact score: 30 / 100.",3
507,"Shockingly bad. Shame on Lana Wachowski, Keanu Reeves, and Carrie-Anne Moss who knew from the start this movie was NOT a true Matrix experience. Keanu and Carrie overhyped this movie and got our hopes up only to disappoint us with by far the worst Matrix movie. Lana claimed in an interview that the special effects would be ""groundbreaking"" just like the first Matrix in 1999. What a joke!",1
508,"If you watch Matrix 1-2-3 please dont watch 4. I want to delete this movie from my memory. This movie just based on lana wachowski's fantasy. Not matrix movie. If Warner Bros had done it alone, without lana wachowski, I'm sure it would have been a better movie.",2
509,"You can tell when someone is running out of either ideas or money, because they dust off the old act and dress it up like something new. This one is no different than that simple concept. They simply waited far too long to do this and there just isn't enough about the originals that deserved this resurrection.Like some of the super hero movies that jumped the shark, this one started off by basically poking fun at itself. That's not a good way to create immersion. Then, the bad guys were just too obvious, and the footage from the original movies to remind us what happened wasn't really needed for anyone who would care enough to watch this film.There were some cool sequences, but most of the film beyond the game designer phase felt like a retread over familiar ground with the same fight sequences.Overall it felt forced and unnecessary, but like the original Matrix, didn't know where to put it's main protagonist. While the development of the background was decently explained, the characters themselves were more bot-like than the actual bots. I do like Moss and Reeves, but I felt Neo was John Wick acting like Neo, couldn't even shave the beard or cut the hair for the role to distinguish himself from Wick who is obviously more fresh in people's mind than is a much younger Neo.",5
510,"I was always one of those people that thought when the rumours of a fourth Matrix started to circulate, it shouldn't happen, some things should just be left alone, and boy, having watched it, this should definitely have been left alone.The action sequences are sub par, the green hue of the original has been replaced and it doesn't work. Keanu and Carrie-Anne dial in their performances and the woke agenda is clear.Overall it was really disappointing and deserves the low ratings.",2
511,"Like many, I was both thrilled and nervous when I seen the trailer for this movie. Admittedly the trailer left me confused and not excited. I really wasn't sure about seeing the movie, but my friend has HBO and I watched it there.Let me tell you that I love the previous movies. I loved the games. I loved the Animatrix even. But even with that knowledge, this movie was just confusing. The acting felt cheesy at times. Some of the recast/new people felt terrible. Overall it didn't even really feel like the Matrix at all. The one Wachowski said they didn't want to work on it. The other one I feel like made it just to make some more. Obviously the other sister had the talent.The first 30 minutes or so is more or less the same as the first movie. And all the deep conversations at the end of the original trilogy doesn't seem to make much sense when it comes to this one.Perhaps the dumbest thing (not a spoiler) is what Neo ""made"". Really? That's part of the story? It's so terrible. Who wrote the script?!? I regret watching this because now I will remember this garbage movie ruining the series. Oh and if your expecting some more mind blowing state of the art stuff like from the other movies, you won't find it here.Oh.... forgot to mention, much of the stuff you expected from jacking in or using a phone to escape, that's all different now. If you want to see this, wait for it to come out on Bluray/DVD and rent it for free from your library. Should note I actually was very sleep about 35 minutes in. That's how dull it was.For those who want to know what Neo ""made"", read below, it's a spoiler:(SPOILER)Neo made a popular game around the world called ""The Matrix"", based on memories he has. Essentially the last three movies but done in a game form. It just feels so dumb and makes no sense. As if the machines would even allow this to begin with.",4
512,"The Matrix brand dilutes every time a new sequel occurs.The film is a salad of symbols and visual themes, nonsensically mixed, sprinkled with moments of action explanation, meant to provide an epic reference to what you see and realize, as the film unfolds, how absurd, illogical and ridiculous everything is.Unfortunately, Warner's desire to make money turns a symbol of modern cinema into a caricature.Not to mention the multi-racial cast. Everything is politically correct and it feels like a marketing tuned product for a global audience, nothing creative and original. Endless regurgitation of cinematic recipes and nothing more...",5
513,"The irony is I remember times when people complained Matrix Revolutions wasn't good, if only they saw what unnecessary sequel would be like... I mean imagine a movie which repeats the story of the first film in certain shots, uses moment flashbacks to build characterization of old characters and dumps cat deja vu moments just cause it was cool in 1999... There is no question why this film was made, there is a question why was it made this bad and lazy by his own creator... If you can't make up stuff, maybe not make it at all then...",5
514,"A lot of people wrote that nobody asked for The Matrix Resurrections to be made. But then again, nobody asked for the first Matrix movie to be made either. And boy what did I liked that one, and the second, and the third. They were just bad-ass.Now they made a fourth movie bringing back Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss surrounded by a second-hand cast. They could not bring back Laurence Fishburne so we got to see a fake Morpeus. Even Hugo Weaving was replaced by a fake Mr. Smith. Priyanka Chopra Jonas as Sati? Why bothering making this movie then? I must be honest; I didn't ask for this movie to be made, but if it was great, you would not hear me complain.This movie should, like Terminator Dark Fate and Venom 2, never been made. For me The Matrix consists of three movies only. The reason I liked those three movies and what this movie lacked, was a good cast around Keanu and Carrie-Ann and a good script (4th movie was mostly bla bla). I understand why people call this movie a quick cash grab.If you want the first three movies to stay alive for you, don't watch this one. This feels more like a rip-off. One question; who cuts the hair-dress of the blue-haired woman in ""the Real World""? There were not many people in Zion. Talking about Zion, they managed to get Jada Smith again as Niobi. Yes, she was in the ""original"" movies, but even then she felt second hand to me. 🤔",3
515,"This movie is as bad as Highlander 2 or The Last Jedi.The only thing you can take away from it is: It is proof the brain of a man really sits in his penis!You get an idea how great this could have been but then there is no story (which makes sense), no chemistry (do not let you tell otherwise with the 5 minutes Neo and Trinity share in this movie together), no plot and no good pacing.You get a lot of flashback scenes for the original films and in every snippet you will get reminded of how much better the old movies were.The fight scenes suck because they do not have used professionals for this I guess.The story at first had a nice idea but then fast moving into Absurdistan.Everything which made THE MATRIX a good movie you will not find here. Even the ""remade"" scenes and ""nods"" to the original always fail to deliver because they are just badly redone! There is nothing of style here anymore. This whole movie feels like a crowdfunded fanfiction movie. Like this game commercial with Data and Commander Riker flying spaceships which should remind you of The Next Generation.Huge missed opportunity here and a very sad real life story because the film maker didn't get, AFTER 20 YEARS!!! He/she had time to think about, what made the MATRIX work so well for a wide audience, how to make a working sequel. This whole movie looked rushed and has no quality to it. This script probably was written in a week.Highlander 2!",1
516,"The Wachowski brothers sacrificed something to become Wachowski's sisters, but apparently also cut off their filmmaking talent!Now that I have seen this film, I know my main task is to suggest to those who have seen the previous trilogy, never go to Matrix 4.Following the destruction of works of art by Leftw00d, this also joined the trash.The only thing worth seeing in this movie is just Keanu Reeves, not the storytellers or the supporting cast(Left Alphabet Society!)The film's shooting techniques and video effects are not at all on par with the previous three, as well as the music and sound effects, which are very annoying and more distracting than the viewer's deep connection.The fight and action scenes of this movie were about the size of a beginner director! Really weak.Everything in this film is a big setback compared to the previous episodes, which cannot be compensated even in the future with a remaster, because the main story of the film is planned based on left-wing nonsense and utopia(Maybe it was just the purpose of a advertisement for Metaverse! A long business message)The left has been trying for years to hide the true face of socialist society, now where better than the imaginary world of an utopia behind the mask of a VR, when your body is really in the garb of a socialist.The supporting actors of this film have been selected with the method of the Academy Awards, the only thing that can be seen is a colorful zoo, you will no longer see the awesomeness of the characters of the previous episode and the seriousness of their role.Selecting Neil Patrick Harris for the role of analyst was the worst possible decision, His appearance and tone of voice in this role, which is the key and important point of the film, can not be related and understood at all, Wait for a moment to tell a joke about ""how I met your mother.""!Repeatedly shown from previous triple videos, and referred to as a game, for Matrix fans they are not and will not be a game, you ruined it Wachowskis, Not Good Bro's!Utopia is a new lie from the left that has now emerged for more control, these are no longer the secret messages of leftist cinema but to show their ideology,But this is not the case in real life, and it will slap those who live in a dream hard. Just look around and see what the left and socialists have done to your society so far.In the end, this was no more than the destruction of previous works.",3
517,"This is just so bad on many levels, avoid at all costs and if you decide on watching it be ready for a cheeky joke one-liner every 30 seconds from every possible character on screen. Zero atmosphere of seriousness as a creative choice, therefore no ethos of the original trilogy whatsoever. All scenes in the matrix itself look generic to the pain. The only thing I enjoyed in this movie was the machine world, huge props for the CG team and Laurence Fishburne for not participating in this silly cash grab nostalgia.",1
518,"The movie starts off kinda promising but quickly glides off into a generic mess. Its a 2.5 hour long film that simultaneously feels rushed and boring at the same time. The plot makes zero sense, all the new characters are bland and unlikable nobodies and they constantly barrage you with scenes from the first 3 movies to show you that this is indeed a matrix film because you probably wouldnt know otherwise. The 2 minutes of Kung fu are pretty bad and hard to watch if you know the prequels.A special shoutout has to go to the sound design though. Remember the interesting music from the first movies? This one has nothing of it. You wont remember anything from matrix 4. Also the general sound effects are just bad. Guns sound like toys, even the same old machines sound different somehow.In the beginning of this film they make fun of lazy nostalgia cashgrabs and most things wrong in hollywood today so they must be self-aware. This means they are probably trolling us on purpose.",3
519,"I really expected the bad reviews would be due to comparisons against the first film.I was wrong.This movie was a complete mess, and was very obviously made to earn a quick buck. Had nothing good in it, what so ever.I wish I had never seen this and ended the triology with the acceptable ending the third film offered.",3
520,As a long time Matrix Fan I was so disappointed with this! Thinking back over history of this franchise they never should've made anything after the first matrix. The second and third matrix were pretty bad but this movie takes the cake as the worst Matrix Movie ever made. Hands Down! It's terrible from start to finish. So Disappointing!,1
521,"I had high hopes but low expectations and as soon as this movie began, I knew I was right to be suspicious. It's a convoluted mess. After seeing the movie, there really is no point to it at all, no reason why it was made. It adds nothing to the story whatsoever, if anything, it dilutes the originals. I can't believe Hollywood has sunk so low to the point that WB executives okayed this for release. The film looks fantastic and the machine city is amazing. That's all I can really say in the positive about this movie, the rest...the rest is complete and utter garbage. The fight scenes don't even come close to feeling like a Matrix movie. And why even have some characters in the movie at all? Smith was a joke. Morpheus was a joke. The analyst was a joke. His scenes where he slowed time down looked like they were out of an 80s music video. Who seriously okayed all this? Again, Matrix is a perfect example of how low Hollywood has sunk. The creative art of moviemaking is dead. All that is left is them trying to make money from the legacy of other films that showed true art and creativity. A sad era of movies right now. Oh and PS...those reviews that use words like ""masterpiece"" etc I assume are all paid for.",3
522,"THE MATRIX (1999) came out more than two decades ago and blew everyone's mind. It is still chic and exciting to watch today. The sequel is also great, yet the third (meant to be the final episode) doesn't live up to the first two. Now, we sadly learn that the fourth is a mistake. While the saga is firmly established as classic of action thriller, THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS (2021) is actually a comedy.The worst part is, besides nothing new or surpassing, TMR incorporates many clips and smears many scenes of the original saga. Why those flashbacks or redos since audience know them all by heart?",3
523,"Another sequel for the sake of sequel, riding off the franchise's name. Nothing substantial or ground breaking. The action is far FAR inferior than the original trilogy. There was no need for this movie, it is too confused for what it wants to do. It is not a reboot and it just feel empty of any bigger vision that its predecessors had. The dialogues try too desperate to be funny. Initially I liked the cuts to the former movies but then it just felt like reminding audience of what happened previously, like spelling everything out for them in case they forget.This movie might've flourished as its own entity but too much unnecessary call backs and being too meta feels like a desperate attempt to be intellectual and make people nostalgic to get money out of their pockets. It is uninspiring, desperate, unnecessary, unfunny with a weak plot and questionable explainations for a ""resurrection"". A failure of a vision of the original ones, that was too big to carry on without a proper story.",3
524,"The Matrix Resurrections is related to original Matrix Story/Saga which is Matrix Trilogy. However, it is the main reason why it is so disappointing, painful, boring, and seems marasmic. If the main goal of Lana Wachowski was in making biggest ""cringe"" and ""butthurt"" in 2021 then goal achieved.Matrix it is not only Lana Wachowski, Keanu Reeves, and Carrie-Anne Moss. Matrix was always something more, like a world in ""Star Wars"", so the level of disappointment equals level of expectations from one of the most extraordinary world of two realities.Honestly, have no idea what should happen to make me watch this movie again.",1
525,"After weeks of debating whether to watch or not due to hearing not so great things I decided to watch and I truly wish I hadn't bothered and kept my fond memories of the original first film in my mind. Its now been ruined and trashed, this has been very disappointing from the storyline to the acting and overall film in general, especially when they could of made an amazing film to follow on from the previous films after so long and truly made a impact but unfortunately that didn't happen. It seemed very half hearted, uninteresting and as though the writers and producers were even bored writing and producing it. If u enjoyed the first films and don't want them ruined please don't waste your time watching this as it will ruin The Matrix altogether for you as it had myself and many others.",2
526,"It was just callbacks, bad writing, and enough plot holes to make plot swiss cheese. I mean 2 and 3 were bad enough, but this is just added garbage on the poop sandwich that 3 was. Whoever wrote it should be kicked mercilessly, and have nothing to drink but vinegar for the next 6 months. That's almost 2.5 hours I'll never get back. Even the effects were garbage, I mean, a 3 year old could have written a better movie.",1
527,"""I grow old but you don't see me complaining..""10 minutes later""i am too old for.."":)As a fan of the original, this is pure garbage, branded with pretty colors and cgi.",1
528,Man this was bad. I'm so glad I have HBO max because I would have been so angry if I saw this in the theater. Even if I saw it for free in the theater I would have been mad just because I left my house for this. Only reason it even gets a 4 is because of Keanu.,4
529,"This movie was complete garbage and has too many political undertones. The subterfuge masquerading with the same name is a total sham. The storyline is pathetic, dialogue is boring, and acting is laughable. Blue hair lady was a joke of a character and the wokeism being forced on us is distasteful and pathetic.",1
530,This film had no seriousness and full of senselessness.Sorry for saying this but it was so disappointing after seeing all of the beautiful cinematography that the original trilogy had created in the first place. Instead of paying tribute to those this movie took all of it as a joke by taking us to a bunch of flashbacks and calling it a videogame created by 'neo' himself .Also the caos and the disconnection between the whole story (if you've already seen it you probably have felt that deficiency )All and all save up some time and watch something else but if you're still curious i can't hold you back.,3
531,"The problem is you're gonna have to watch the first three movies to understand this one. I having watched all of them multiple times still don't fully understand this movie. The first movie was in 2 parts the world and the action. This movies themes are a mess, it's meta, critiquing itself so much that you lose all connection to the meaning. Their is so much fan boying, I groaned so many times with them reusing the same intro. Next the action is way too complicated too many characters jumping back and forth cutting between them. The characters are indestructible, the first movie people would bleed, this one they walk away. The lead up to the finale is rushed it's clear to see they cut a few scenes to reduce run time.This movie somehow spends too much time in the matrix and out of the matrix. Failing to set the stakes in either or leave us connected to no one, it wants to rush to explain itself but explains it to no one.This movie is a terminator reboot which somehow doesn't forget the middle movies. We must include the main two characters or it won't be the Matrix. Leave them behind and use someone else to connect to the next generation, because like the movie said you are just harvesting nostalgia.",4
532,"I don't think there will be another one. It all depends how much money it makes but I will guess the enthusiasm is not there after this abortion escapee has dragged itself across the screen.They have broken the story and world so much now in this movie that there's no repairing it. This movie is not entertaining. Instead of building on the story it disassembles it and reinvents itself.... Yeah, much like the creators themselves. Whatever they were on when they thought this up is not good for their creativity. The ideas in this film destroy the first three films.It's full of woke too. None of the action scenes were exciting and the ending was so lame I felt embarrassed having seen it. It cannot be unseen unfortunately. It's going to be one of those ""watch the first three but avoid the 4th one like it has leprosy"".The third film needs to come with a sticker that reads ""do not resuscitate"". Whatever you bought back in this one is not the same creature. It's like the Pet Cemetery of movies. They buried a copy of Matrix Revolutions in there and this soul-less thing came back.",2
533,I thought it would never end. Tedious and boring. Such a shame. I think perhaps they should stop making any movies in this series. I lost interest very quickly.,
534,"Wow i really was looking forward to a new matrix film but was let down by a very messy story and felt like this film just did not need to be made , they have waited the best part of 20 years to make this film and thats the best they could come up with ....? Very disappointed .",4
535,This film should of never been made. There are some great visuals but that is it. The film even pokes fun at the fact it shouldn't of been made. By name dropping the studio saying they are being forced to make a sequel with or without the original cast.,1
536,"First of all, an eighth of the movie comprises of flashbacks from previous 3, which could have been easily replaced better content. Keanu's own acting of being seemingly confused the entire time seems almost real as to ""why the heck am I in this movie in the first place?"".You watch the movie and if you have seen the previous 3, you would miss the precision and sleekness which was in them in this movie. The matrix program itself feels too real instead of reminding us that it is in fact a virtual reality system.This movie should have focused on passing the baton from Keanu to some a new protagonist so as to pave way for more sequels. A resurrection no one wished for.",4
537,"Trying to understand why this film was made in the first place. I can see how they want to rewrite the trilogy ending, but after 2.5 hrs that felt like 2.5 days, We didn't learn anything that We didn't already know. Too much nostalgia and felt like a film about a film treating me like a 2 yr old (like who ISN'T going to figure out who is Morphious and Smith. Seriously?). And an eternity of closeup dialogue from the old Matrix players fighting for Smith? This is the best they could come up with this talented of a team? Feels like lots of potential wasted.",5
538,"I was never a fan of the Matrix movies, but could watch it for the action parts.But, this is sooo bad, like that did it with eyes closed and on some have LSD like drugs!I get it, some think there could be more money made from, some actors thought it would bring them a career, some others thought lets stay relevant and some i guess did someone a favor ( reeves &amp; moss).Nevertheless its just a big waste of anyones time!!",2
539,Perfectly encapsulated everything wrong with cinema today.As a long time Matrix fan I struggled to finished this movie. It substitutes creativity and style for cheap nostalgia moments that only make the experience worse.Expect to see this one in the bargain bin at your local drug store in no time.,2
540,Watching this film was a total waste of time. Who would have thought that they can make a film worse than the third Matrix. But ever since Wachowski brothers have turned themselves into Wachowski sisters there apparently is no limit to how bad a film they can make. I was bored after about first quarter of the film and had to force myself to watch the rest. I regret that decision.,3
541,"They ruing every franchise, and this is not an exception.They know they are selling the worst quality product, and they tell it to you all the time on the movie. They are not even subtle.When a movie needs to explain itself ""this is what is happening"", is because is mediocre, and don't know how to tell stories.They explicitly tell to the viewer ""you watch garbage, and we are treating you like that""",1
542,Sound: 3Acting: 1Script: 1Videography: 3Special effects: 1Plot holes: 10Toxic feminism: 10Average movie to watch in 2022 when all recent movies feel like they've been written and directed by high school students.Even Keanu can't save this catastrophe.,3
543,"I thought it can't be worse than 2 , 3And I was wrong.Watching it turtored me.With all of this new technology, still you can't make a movie like matrix 1999. Such a waste of time and money.",1
544,"Lets start by saying I'm a Matrix apologist. I love the first trilogy. The first movie is a 10/10, the sequels rate maybe 7. Not nearly as good, but peppered with moments of brilliance. They are elevated in my eyes, partly because they take place in a setting that I find to be quite intriguing.So, I was extremely excited to be getting a new entry into the series! I liked Animatrix and would love to have new stories told in the Matrix universe. Learning that Neo and Trinity would be coming back worried me a little. And I think I was right to worry. It feels like a bit of a retread.I actually enjoyed the first act. The meta questions about what is and isn't reality harken back to the themes of the first movie.But after that, things go downhill pretty fast. They play loosy-goosy with lots of the in-fiction rules, making up all sorts of new stuff that barely hangs together.Bots? Bleh.How did they build a new city without the machines noticing?No more Oracle but somehow the Merivingian survives?The super speed of the Analyst doesn't make a lot of sense or why Smith can suddenly match him at the end out of NOWHERE to save Neo with Deus Ex Machina. Or why Smith is alive at all really -- he should definitely be destroyed.Sigh.Just really sloppy writing for the entire second half of the movie. And none of the gravitas or excellent dialogue from the earlier movies. The new Smith and new Morpheus don't hold a candle.",6
545,"You find out that you were right, nothing more needed to be said..This movie was just a pointless, soulless addendum to a franchise that never should have gone beyond the first movie.It tried to be meta, and in a sense it was, which happened to be it's downfall. For the most part it was the equivalent of a compilation album that relied mostly on flashbacks and cutscenes and sly edits to tell whatever story it was telling.Most of it made no sense, and not in the ""I need to watch this a dozen times over just to wrap my head around it sense"", but instead a ""this makes no sense because it makes no actual sense"". It lacked coherency and could not even answer the question as to why it was made.While it had some interesting ideas.. kind of... the only real standout was the Merovingian's mad rant about how everything is awful, nothing is real, and the internet has sucked the life out of everything good for the all mighty proliferation of content, and the mindless usage of smartphones has turned everyone into drones who crave discord, violence and misery and not peace, which is ultimately what powers the Matrix... or the internet hate machine.It's almost a perfect movie for today's day and age, it was there, and now it's gone... a forgotten relic of a more refined era.OH, and ""Machines"" is now a pejorative, and their preferred proper noun is ""Synthients"".I almost get the sense that the singular Wachowski involved in this tactfully and thoroughly trashed their own creation, simply to never be bothered to make another one ever again -- and I absolutely hope that this series is laid to rest, forever.",1
546,"Warner Bros had been pressuring the Wachowskis for more Matrix movies since 2003. Sometime around 2019 they made it apparent that they were going to go ahead with 'resurrecting' the franchise with or without the Wachowskis' input. They were threatening to hire a screenwriter best known for making Marvel super hero movies (and not the best installments of that unfortunate franchise either) who wanted to develop a Matrix ""expanded universe"". Lilly Wachowski still flatly refused to be involved in the farce. I can only guess that Lana reasoned that she wouldn't be able to simply wash her hands of the franchise. Just as the awful new Star Wars movies reflect on George Lucas even though he's no longer involved with them, a resurrected, never-ending, money grubbing zombie Matrix franchise would still reflect poorly on the Wachowskis. It may be WB's IP but it was the Wachowskis' creative work.So Lana hatched a bold plan - make a Matrix movie so bad and so unprofitable that WB will realize it's not worth trying to squeeze any more money out of the franchise and just let it rest in peace. One terrible movie is a black mark on the franchise, but hopefully the true fans will see it for what it is and disregard it, and it won't be nearly as bad as the zombified Matrix-themed MCU cash cow that may have resulted if Resurrections had been even moderately successful. The first act (40 minutes) of Resurrections isn't a massive mise en abyme - it's a not-so-subtle coded message that explains the motivation for the film.""But look at this place. We did this, together. Now what? Things have changed, the market's tough. I'm sure you can understand why our beloved parent company, Warner Brothers, has decided to make a sequel to the trilogy."" ""What?"" ""They informed me they're going to do it with or without us."" ""I thought they couldn't do that."" ""Oh, they can, and they made it clear they'll kill our contract if we don't cooperate.""But what about the previous scene where Lana makes fun of Matrix fans, represented by the game developers, who think they understand the original trilogy by reducing it to trans politics, crypto anarchy, allegory for capitalist exploitation of the working class, or bullet time action sequences? Isn't this fourth-wall-breaking reference to WB just more fan bashing? I don't think it is. The original trilogy may not have been solely about any of those things, but they were all certainly themes, Lana isn't disavowing them. The dialogue concerning the mise en abyme, the original trilogy, is all genuine, I think the dialogue about the sequel is also genuine and meant to convey that we're about to be treated to a movie that Lana didn't really want to make.The movie proper is one big second act from minute 40 to the end. It's mostly fan service: you wanted fist fights, bullet stopping, hover ships? Well here you go, enjoy it. But there is some subtle messaging in there. Whereas the original trilogy was about human autonomy as a linchpin to some Gödelian ceiling the machines had reached in their existence (as well as trans politics, crypto anarchy, allegory for capitalist exploitation of the working class, and bullet time action sequences ;), Resurrections is about the Blue Pills, the people who want to stay in the Matrix. It's a critique of modern dependence on social media - we're inserting ourselves willingly. The dividing line between the Matrix and the 'real world' is no longer clear, hence the color palettes and character costumes in the two domains are now almost indistinguishable whereas they both served as a clear demarcation in the original trilogy. It's a critique on the modern managerial class who've transitioned from the suit &amp; tie Agent oppressors to the always-casual-Friday, wants-to-be-your-buddy boss who's still the same old oppressor but in a new costume. There is a semblance of a good, meaningful story here, possibly an earlier script that involved people willingly returning to the Matrix en masse. But alas, the purpose of Resurrected wasn't to be good.What we get instead is lots of bland action sequences, poorly written dialogue, unremarkable effects and soundtrack, poor audio levels, forgettable characters, contrived character resurrections, and a plot that's barely holding it all together. Overall, a pathetically poor execution, as, I can only hope, was intended.People have mentioned that some of the Wachowskis' other projects since Revolutions have been pretty lackluster (looking at you Jupiter Ascending), but Resurrections is something else. It's not just bad, it's literally a bomb meant to lay the franchise to rest. Honestly, I would give Resurrections a 3 or 4 out of 10, but I feel some obligation to go with the 1. I hope WB receives the message loud and clear - hands off, let it be, ""IT IS DONE.""",1
547,This movie was extremely boring. I did not care for any of the new characters. The story was bad. Way too much unnecessary scenes and dialog. We don't need another Matrix movie after this dud.,4
548,"I am sorry but i could not make it to the end.... Stopped watching way before the end... even the fighting scenes are so bad in comparison to the original Matrix movie... to all fans not yet watched this cringe wokeness, dont even start watching it! My god the dialogue is even for a non english speaker so basic and bad! This kovie should never be filmed!",1
549,"I have heard all the negative reviews, but still decided to watch this. This was such a mistake.From the very beginning I was holding myself from turning it off, but eventually I couldn't handle it anymore. This is just a pure garbage, that tries to look clever and interesting. In reality it is horrible in literally every aspect: plot, casting, action sequences, some weird Marvel-like jokes that seem totally out of place. I really can't understand how a movie that came out in 2021 can look so much worse than the original, that came out 22 years before.Do yourself a favor - don't watch this trash and save some good memories about era-defining original.",2
550,"It's a shame, because I'm sure the actors were passionate about the film and tried their best, but we knew what this was from the trailer. The plot didn't work, the CGI takes you out of the realm of possibility, to sheer ridiculous characters and over the top woke/meta nonsense. Even the credit music was just so over the top and bad. This was a disappointment.",2
551,"Yikes. Thought I was watching CW so I turned the channel! Who makes MATRIX 4 with a LOW BUDGET?? Lame flashbacks throughout. And how painful it was to go through it all again this way when 1&amp;2 were works of art. The WORST PART was that NOW we're to believe the MACHINES are good?! Hollywood (owned by China now) is pushing Transhumanism HARD. Put on your VR, disconnect from your autonomy, and TAP INTO THE MATRIX! God/dess help us all.",1
552,"When the movie was announced, I was interested and exciting. Upon watching it, the quickly turned to bored and disappointed. The movie is simply one long callback to the original Matrix movies and takes far too much pleasure in trying to make itself seem witty and intelligent with all it's self-referential moments. Unfortunately that comes at the expense of interesting characters, scenes and action. As to the story? Well, retcon the original Matrix so Trinity becomes the hero and the Neo the sidekick instead of vice versa and you have the story of matrix resurrections. Why did the director feel the need to do this? I can only guess.",2
553,Just another cash grab nostalgia sequel that has no reason to exist. BORING beyond belief. Essentially just a retrad of the original Matrix with no flair or originality. Just pointless callbacks to the original trilogy. It tries so hard to be meta and make fun of itself but I didn't laugh at one joke. This film is the joke. And the ending is laughably bad. Trinity IS THE ONE.... Sure. Pointless reboot. Avoid at all costs.,3
554,"That is most likely the general feeling you will get while watching the movie - it looks and feels more like a cheap B-movie than a sequel to a hugely popular movie.It is very hard to find anything positive in this movie. It is just terrible all around. The biggest flaw is that it is so completely and utterly boring and uninteresting. The movie is full of pointless dialogue that is supposed to be ""deep"" and intellectual, but comes across more like you are listening to the village idiot argue with the local doofus. The characters are equally uninteresting and you don't really care what happens to any of them. The story is also totally dreadful and uninteresting.",1
555,Matrix world is so dear to me. I am a fan. I was waiting for this for years.What i saw on the screen? Tribute to feminism.This is not matrix. This is cheap ripoff to promote feminism = men are stupid animals and women rule the world.Such a pity... I wish i never saw it.,1
556,"Would've left if I wasn't in the company of others.This movie sums up everything that is wrong with modern Hollywood:Make a reboot of an old classicReduce it to a cringy parody of itselfMake the bad guys completely useless (I said in the beginning of the film that they wouldn't manage to kill a single protagonist, even the most unimportant ones, and I wasn't wrong). Stormtroopers have better aim.Copy every single element from the earlier movies, even the tiniest details that doesn't make sense outside of their specific story lines, and force them into an incoherent, cringeworthy plot. I could've written a better story line within ten minutes - when I was around seven.Insert some more cringe.Make a constant mockery out of itself throughout with meta-jokes.Make it into a bizarre love movieForced nostalgia because the movie can't stand on it's own legsLet's speak philosophy, or rather how philosophical we are without actually having anything philosophical to say.Make every single male character older, pathetic shadows of their former self.Make the female characters overpowered. Neo is The One but here Trinity is the one who can fly for no apparent reason. Didn't she die in the trilogy? Oh, never mind, nothing makes sense here anyway.Cringe, cringe, cringeAdd another plot holeAntagonist female characters, even side characters, can only be defeated by other female characters. Will preferably never die on screen.Make an male antagonist make chauvinist comments so the female hero can kick his ass (repeatedly)Some more cringeMake a character lesbian (who wasn't in the trilogy) just for the sake of itFollow the Marvel blueprintWhat I don't get about Hollywood is that they're giving these enormous budgets to complete morons. They could've picked better writers at random from the street.",2
557,"Excuse me, but can I ask a question? What happened to the originality that once Matrix stood for. This is just a love story and nothing else. I'm a diehard Matrix fan but this is just extremely disappointing that it hurts my brain. We all know NEO was the hero but now all of a sudden because it's 2021 the roles have completely been turned around. Hollywood is making me sick with their propaganda and this movie again shows...",2
558,"OMG! Seriously? Please don't make any more Matrix movies. It was awful. Very rarely do I wish I could get my money back but this is one of those times. The movie was difficult to follow, poor supporting cast and yes, even the special effects and cgi felt subpar and cheaply done. Personally, I felt they should have stopped after the first movie but the special effects in movies 2 and 3 were very great and saved both films in spite of their poor storyline.",2
559,"Many flaws, but it's worst sin was to be boring. Poor story, terrible acting, forgettable characters...all can be overlooked. It simply cannot be boring as well.",2
560,"My mind is still boggling from this wannabe Matrix entry and how it was greenlit in the first place.The Matrix is one of the most influential and ground breaking films ever made, which re-invented the SCI-Fi/Action genre in such a way that many others since then have tried to emulate and failed miserably.Here everything feels amateurish and almost TV Movie like, with some dialogue which is unbelievably cringe worthy at times. The self references dotted throughout are lazy and contrived.The direction is flat, it feels like Lana Wachowski lacked conviction in it's execution to show something different, and to bring The Matrix screaming into the 21st century with some glorious inventively choreographed scenes of mayhem utilising the latest state of the art film techniques.Instead we get some dubious quick edits, and odd choices of slow-mo blurred shots, nothing flows well enough to show if any time was spent carefully story boarding and really putting some thought into them.The new Morpheus and Agent Smith are not a patch on the originals, Laurence Fishbourne and Hugo Weaving are sadly missed, but I'm glad they didn't tarnish their legacy by appearing in it. Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss just sleepwalk their way though the film.I'm going to single out Jada Pinkett Smith for her atrocious performance, her aging make-up effects are terrible, but her presence just sucks the little oxygen left in the film out of it.Apart from Jessica Henwick, all the other new characters are easily forgettable.It's been 18 years since the last one, you would think there's been ample time to nurture a better script and to think up something more spectacular.There are so many unnecessary flashbacks also to the previous films, it feels like the writers and Lana are treating the audience like a bunch of children with attention spans limited to the past few minutes.It's quite insulting for the viewer as we've all spent considerable time invested in the previous trilogy and know what happened.I'm trying really hard to figure out what the point of this film was, as it adds nothing to the already completed trilogy as it just more or less rehashes what came before it.An unnecessary, uneventful film that crushes any chances on seeing the Sci-Fi/Action genre reinvented for the 21st century.",1
561,"From oustanding and visionary The Matrix, through medicore Reloaded and Revolutions to this fake that should not be called Matrix... In my opinion this movie should not exist. This movie is like turtle, trying to follow and catch rabbit - I cannot understand why and for what. I do not recommend, it's a waste of time.",3
562,"Any old fan of The Matrix franchise will be disappointed. Just read the reviews. Are they correct with their disapproval? I can understand their annoyances. Below are my main criticisms of this edition:Fail Nr 1:There is a limit to how much mumbo jumbo talk about fantasy worlds I can digest before I get bored and frustrated. And this sequel is stretching the limits of my tolerance of incredibly vague dialogues, to put it very politely...Fail Nr 2:The supporting actors are acting way below par. There isnt any real bad guy to speak of. Such a shame. And there isnt a female lead actress, who impresses me either. Carrie Ann Moss is good, but she has gotten too little screentime to lift up this movie.Fail Nr 3:Some of the special effects are cringeworthy and cheap looking. And when there are decent action scenes with good special effects, there are suddenly so many special effects that it is overkill.Fail Nr 4:It lasts too long. 2 and a half hours! Are they kiddin'?Fail Nr 5:This story is WAY too complicated to even begin to explain. What a mess of a story!Not any good?Positive Nr 1:Only the start of this movie is still reasonably promising. The first half hour seemed to be a good start to something special, but then it got stuck half way through.Positive Nr 2:Keanu Reeves is still the man. He looks like a Jesus character with his beard and his acting skills are really good. It's not Keanu Reeves' fault that this movie turned into a mess.Positive Nr 3:There is enough fast paced action (from time time) to not fall asleep. Oops, I did fall asleep anyway...",5
563,"Why was this created? Who signed off on this and said, YES, this is worth reopening a trilogy that had a definite conclusion. This is a Lana Wachowski vanity project that pokes fun at sequels, while literally following nostalgia trope of sequels. It pokes fun of the audience for caring about the first Matrix by reducing its iconic, philosophical dialog to Morpheus talks too much so get on with it nonsense. Yet, it never actually gets on with it as it rehashes the same Wake Up into Reality storyline, in a same way as it actively pokes fun.It brings back characters that are so well recognized for the namesake and not propagating the plot, aka Agent Smith and Morpheus who were recast and ruined those characters. The new characters are uninspired and have no individuality except that they're all smitten with Neo and the lore (aka audience).The self-awareness of the franchise is comical (in the bad way) and detracts from anything meaningful while antagonizing the audience for wanting good action choreography, more philosophy and boundary pushing effects. This film decided to go in a direction of ""you get none of the Matrix"" in this Resurrection.The effects are beyond terrible, jittery and shaky cam effects. Fights are just sad, nothing close to martial arts of the 1999 thru 2003. Effects are hilariously underwhelming for all of the talks of the natural light, there is gross oversaturation of the natural backgrounds to the point of a pixie dream feel.And lastly, the plot, or the lack of it... This was the biggest gut punch of this movie. There is nothing but nostalgia bate, cynicism and failed Romeo and Juliet attempt of overly powerful, borderline sentient beings that defy death because everyone defies death in this movie. There are no stakes, no real conflict, and nothing that says anything that we don't already know.It's a CASH grab by WB and Lana Wachowski, there is no other explanation for the existence of such a horrible, lazy, comically-inept, Futurama Lobsterteinment-inspired, grift of a nostalgia dumpster fire that puts a final nail in a Matrix lore coffin. One take away from this movie... don't asks for more sequels to an excellent movie, as you will be punished and made to feel stupid for expecting same excellence again.",1
564,"The 1999 ""Matrix"" was not a good film, it was the standard for a good film. The original idea was so good that it held on two sequels that, with all their imperfections, together form a unique trilogy. Unfortunately, we also received the fourth half-sequel, half-remake of the mentioned movie, which, if it had any spirit, could be called a parody rather than a serious film. But, we have what we have, now at least we got a standard for a bad movie, and an example of what kind of movies should not be made. It has already become proverbial for Hollywood to record ""woke"" propaganda, instead of slightly watchable and entertaining achievements.To paraphrase a line from the film that best describes the reason for this misdeed itself: ""Warner Brothers decided to shoot a sequel to the Matrix trilogy, with or without us."" Surprisingly honest, nothing else to say. Apart from the original John Wick, pardon, Neo and Trinity, the rest of the cast consists of comic characters who, all together, can hardly bear the epithet of actors. The script and dialogues, on the other hand, are written in such a way that no serious acting would help.The vain repetition of scenes already seen (and literally), a patched plot full of holes without any meaning, rather bad effects and a change of the original coloring are just some of the troubles this film is dealing with. It was also expected that the original story will be altered, so we find out that Neo is actually not the only ""One"", but that they are, in fact, Neo and Trinity, but, above all, Trinity. Everything in this film goes downhill, from the very beginning to the uninspiring ending. Cheap, just as check-out music is cheap compared to the original by RATM.If you only can, don't waste time with this movie. It is better to spend it, for example on ""Spiderman: No Way Home,"" and see how a fun sequel to a franchise can be recorded, with an original approach and a real look back at previous sequels. I am far from favoring so-called actors like Tom Holland or Zendaya, but the film is at least craftily done properly.The only sympathies for this film are for reminding us how good the first ""Matrix"" was, by showing scenes from the original realization about every five minutes. And that's probably because there is nothing better to see here anyway.",3
565,"Resurrections is the biggest film letdown in the last several years. At least Reloaded and Revolutions had good CGI, lots action and a somewhat coherent story. This one was boring, cheap looking and just plain dumb. Sadly, but I wouldn't even call it a popcorn movie. Really it seemed like a bad Syfy original, not the blockbuster we all hoped for. I'll just be pretending this one doesn't exist.",1
566,Hollywood all they did is turn the Matrix a good Sci-Fi and exploit it's pass popularity to cash in. It's a dog plain and simple I could only stand about 20 minutes of the film then left.,2
567,Ruined the matrix.... just ruined it. Feminism once again ruins another movie. They should of just not made another movie than make this one. Its terrible. Hell the ending outro music is a female rip off song. The whole thing is just bad. Coppied scenes. Constant reuse of old material in a worse way. Just no... like why? Why are women ruining these movies so bad. Like common.... not everything has to be woman power and ruin franchises.,1
568,The Script was terrible and it felt like a cheap movie. It is like it was written and directed by someone else who had nothing to do with the previous sequels.,3
569,The trilogy is perfect. I entered the cinema with smile and ambitious. The cinema is full and everyone wait to start. First 30 minutes was good for me. But acting is awful. Bugs was the best in acting. Interesting character! The new Morpheus was strange. Keanu and Trinity was awful acting. For sure not to watch this movie.It's very strange with the scene with pills. When i left the cinema i was so sad for this sequel. This is needless sequel.,4
570,I was hoping for more. 30 minutes in and I thought I better rewatch the original trilogy because I haven't a clue wtf is going on. But unfortunately I didn't need to rewatch it. This was bad. No real sense to the plot. The original Matrix was so much better. The characters were more on point. Morpheus and Agent Smith in this resurrection must have been ordered from Wish. Don't waste your time :(,4
571,"The casting could have been better... the balance of the movie was out of reach there no chemistry between the new ones n old ones...why is the movie so focus on the new cast where the old cast get like a glimpse of time in the screen.. keanu was like in &amp; out of the movie for 5 min - 20 mins tops &amp; Carrie-Anne Moss was like 4 mins max.The story line was bruh!? The script was heh....? The new cast was *Bluek* .. Really 60 after the war...Dont get me wrong i am a big fan of the matrix but is just that the story, plot &amp; ending could have been better.",5
572,Slow bad fighting scenes. Scared to touch each other. Full of flashbacks i thought i was watching a parody sometimes. Not serious.I really want to see a Tom Cruse movie now cause he does much better fighting scenes that this kids stuff. Seriously. The camera was many times so bad it completely disconnected me from the movie. Full of silly and forgettable characters. They made fan of the original Trilogy.I like KR but he is not fighting as he used to.And the camera was so bad was actually showing this details in your face. Bunches they don't touch or awkward body defense position when the other actor didn't out his arms and legs where it should be... very very clumsy!So disappointed.It had potential but the execution was bad. :(,5
573,"I honestly cannot believe how bad this film actually is, I went into it with no expectations so I couldn't be disappointed but boy was I wrong, this is worse than I ever could have imagined, they have slowly got worse over the years, the original was fantastic, second was quite good, third had a lot of potential but the story was awful, this one just tops them all, it really is that bad, I honestly don't know how I lasted the full length of it, I really hope they don't do any more now.",1
574,"These reboots/sequels really need to stop as its just becoming more and more obvious that they're just excuses for ridiculous cash grabs.The first Matrix is already an instant classic and while I'm not a fan of the Reloaded or Revolution, it still felt like a great way for the trilogy to end...but of course the execs at Warner Bros don't care and are willing to milk any franchise just for an extra buck while taking dumps on the fans. It's very obvious that this film is taking the same beats as the first film and yet, somehow, the story is such a convoluted mess that I had to keep on asking myself what the story was ultimately about. They even take time to retcon a lot of important stuff from the previous films which makes everything just feel worthless and less impactful in the end.I think it's also kind of amazing how they managed to take one of the most revolutionary aspects of the Matrix and managed to downgrade it to something bland and forgetful which is the action. The choreography seems so generic, Neo spends more time using his powers than actually fighting, and the cinematography just isn't there to make it interesting. Did they just forget their main star was John Wick?? Probably.I think they had something potentially interesting in the beginning, but in the end they somehow managed to screw it all up, further prove why the franchise needs to end, and prove that they NEED to do something original for once.",3
575,"First of all, you don't wait 20 yrs and not make a 3D iMax, especially, in this series.The movie itself, this is typical 2022 film industry garbage. They make films so procedurally nowadays, their is no creativity. The young actors of course sucked as usual these days. The visuals weren't even as good as the first movie. The story, as usual nowadays, it made absolutely no sense and didn't even add up. A lot of this film didn't even mesh together. This film has so much left leaning political agendas to it, the casting makes that clear and I think maybe this film was supposed to be a comedy? Idk, idk what I watched, it wasn't the matrix but I'm not surprised it's junk, that is all our current generation produces. And, like everything made these days, you're supposed to know outside information just watching it.I'm 34 and I have no hope for the filming industry anymore, too much about making money, and political agendas.",
576,I am writing this while watching the film. I am bored. The story they are trying to tell is not needed and over explained. The lack of Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishbourne also detracts.Jada pinkett Smith was bad enough in the last film but her acting under all the make up in this is laughable.The film was not needed at all and the story should of been left alone and finished in 2003 where it ended.The visuals are good but not enough to save this poorly executed sequel.,4
577,"Imagine a politically correct millennial getting the original script, adding women to make it gender neutral, then making those women strong enough to fight agents. Just because women have to be shown as strong, no matter how little sense it makes within the matrix universe.The first half just copies the original movie. The second half the other two.This is a movie that should not have been made. It gets two stars for Neil Patrick Harris.",2
578,"I just wasted 2,5 hours on this horrible example of lack of imagination and ideas. I didn't expect to see something good but this movie is a complete mess, unable to wake any emotion, cringeful, abudent in bad acting, reuse of some first movie ideas, really bad cgi and awful writing. Comparing to this garbage, Reloaded and Revolution are Oscar worthy. Avoid with all costs.",1
579,"Couldn't figure out why this latest movie went off script of the last three movies until I read the directors comments about what the movie was about. They took advantage of todays 'woke' , and are saying that they decided neo and trinities connection is identical to what transgenders are going through today. Dont' believe me? Look it up. Bye bye HBO max, if we just went back to making movies for entertainment......",1
580,"Greetings again from the darkness. One could view being number four in a trilogy as similar to being the 'third wheel' on a date. Or one could view it as a new beginning, with a familiar foundation. Your way of viewing will likely depend on whether you choose the red pill or the blue one. This time out, it's only writer-director Lana Wachowski, without her sister Lilly. Their groundbreaking first film in the series hit screens in 1999, and it's been 18 years since the last. Lana co-wrote this script with David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon.There is a stunning opening action sequence that is so well done, most will feel like it alone is worth the price of a ticket. But it's another of the early scenes that really caught my attention and had me laugh out loud and applaud the audacity. Keanu Reeves stars (again) as Thomas Anderson, a renowned game developer best known for his award-winning games (actually a trilogy) 'The Matrix' from 20 years ago. His work on a new game called 'Binary' is interrupted when he's summoned to the office of his boss played by Jonathan Groff. Anderson is informed that Warner Brothers, their corporate owner, is not interested in his new game, but instead demands another game in 'The Matrix' series. This is either self-parody or Lana's passive-aggressive revenge, either of which is a bit humorous.Anderson regularly battles the blurring lines of reality and sees a psychiatrist (Neil Patrick Harris) who prescribes blue (of course) pills to help the patient deal with daily life. There is no way I'm going into the story lines that are tossed around here, but there will be fans who are happy and fans who aren't. In fact, this one teases with so many elements that are left hanging, we aren't sure whether Lana is setting the stage for more to come or merely having fun stirring the pot.What does matter is that Neo and Trinity get the shot at a legitimate relationship/romance. The return of Carrie-Ann Moss is treated with all due respect. She shows off her acting skills, which, let's face it, are far superior to the lead actor here. Together they make an interesting couple and we pull for things to work out. Jada Pinkett Smith returns as Niobe, and some new characters are introduced as well. In addition to Jonathan Groff and Neil Patrick Harris, the most intriguing of these is Jessica Henwick as Bugs (like Bunny). The newly imagined Morpheus is played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas scores a couple of scenes as Sati. Oh, and the answer is a definitive yes - we do miss Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne (despite some of Lana's creativity).Neo and Trinity and special effects are the real draw for the series, and though this one is littered with self-parody, one of the most disappointing elements comes in the fight scenes which fall short of expectations. While I enjoyed the multiple story lines, even the partial bits, it's the big finale action sequence that had me convinced the shark had officially been jumped. It's drawn out far too long and repetitive at times, and with the 2 and a half hour run time, you have earned the right to question ""The One"".Opening in theaters and on HBO Max on December 22, 2021.",6
581,Almost fell asleep during the first half. More action during the second and a whole lot of terrible plot to go till the horrible ending. Keanu was sleeping through the whole filming of this movie. Don't bother watching this. Rewatch Matrix 1 instead.,1
582,Should have left it buried. How to kill a great cinema experience in 2 and a bit hours. This was a car crash of a movie. Confusing doesn't quite describe it. Special effects were the highlight of the movie but nothing new or inventive. No more please...,2
583,"Sometimes a film meets all expectations you have going in...And sometimes, it meets every fear.-Bringing characters back that had no business being alive? Check.-Recasting some characters with new actors that could never capture the character the way the original did? Check.-Plot that made absolutely no sense? Check.-Making all the significant events/battles/plots/sacrifices of the prior movies irrelevant to make this sequel seem justified? Check.-Breaking all the prior established rules of The Matrix and creating new ones? Check.-Somehow making action sequences and special effects look worse than 20 years ago? Check.Absolutely terrible. Embarrassing and insulting to be claimed under the same name and franchise as the original film.",1
584,"I watched only half of it, very boring story. Empty movie. Computers, screens, phones, such an empty life. Sad really sad. Fake world. Nothing interesting, nothing new. Same Thema. Better they would leave these old good movies without following parts, they just ruin it.",3
585,"Unfortunately, this doesn't even measure up to that nostalgia trip. The Force Awakens, though unoriginal, had a formula that still worked and was pleasing to audiences. This film does not.I really didn't want to hate this movie as much as I did. I thought I was expecting a film that, though terrible, would still have the elements that make their movies so appealing to me. But this film was so focused on nostalgia, that they just forgot to do that. The movie is put together in such a way that it was impossible to decipher what was studio interference and actual filmmaking choices.Among these irking choices is the first act of the film being basically a Funny or Die sketch on a budget. There's Rom-Com vibes, Keanu's doing comedy bits (and failing), there's even cameos from Wachowski faves like Chad Stahelski (John Wick) and Christina Ricci (Speed Racer). I did think the meta-fictional take on ""what makes The Matrix great"" was entertaining, but weirdly out of place. Honestly, it could just be taken on it's own as a 35-minute Youtube Premium short film.Before I go any further, as a defender of the worst Wachowski films, It really hurts me to write this. Watching this film, it's clear that this was a very personal project for Lana. Coping with the loss of her parents and the split from her sister/directing partner Lilly, the film was clearly meant to be comfort food in a time of hardship. It's clear from the narrative that Wachowski is just as big of fan of the movies as we are and this film is a celebration of that. That's something I have a lot of appreciation for.Before this film came out, I had an idea what I wanted, but after this viewing, I don't know what I wanted at all. If you want a nostalgia trip just watch the first one again.Forgive me Lana.",2
586,"Convoluted, boring story line, horrible pacing and soulless characters. Put me to sleep. What a way to ruin a trilogy. You would be hard pressed to watch a worker movie this year. Do yourself a favour and give this one a pass.",3
587,"Listen, there is a lot that could be said about how horrible this movie is. I do not want to waste my time or yours.....Go ahead and watch it if you grew up with the originals but don't have high expectations. It's basically the first movie poorly recycled with tons of plot holes.I don't normally welcome remakes but I feel this should have been one or at least a continuation of the same universe but with a new story line.",1
588,"Terrible fight choreography, arguably worse script but an OK cast, but they ruined all the original characters. I had to wonder if this was a parody.The original martix movies showcased the agents and even entering the matrix as a threat. This one however, completely the opposite. Made it half way threw.",1
589,"I am a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. But this movie is getting a 1 star from me because of how excited I was. And to find a cheesy, rushed movie. Highly disappointed.",1
590,It helped me set a low bar and mediocre expectations for this movie... so after I saw it and was both thrilled and inspired by its raw and deeper and practical message... I had no option but to give it a 10! So thank you.,10
591,"Completely unnecessary. They should have stopped after the first matrix, all the rest of the movies were so below that quality barThis last one (hopefully) is worst. Do you really need to have the story gutted and ruined like this and for what ? So you can have a female hero ? Stupidity to the maxGod damn feminism is ruined another thing. And the worst of it all ? That version of wake up in the end ? Just horrendous.",1
592,"Where do I start. Lana wachowski was forced to make a 4th addition to a series she didn't want to do. She even tells you this in the film as part of the off com that makes you cringe through the first hour.I almost left the cinema on a few occasions during the film. It was an abomination to the film industry. As far as film franchises go, this is the worst addition to any.The actor selection was awful, story line is tragic and the ending might make you sick in to your popcorn with just how bad it is.Warner Brothers are to blame for all this. Avoid at all costs.",1
593,"After all the disastrous reviews flooding the internet in the last few days I have to say I'm almost surprised about THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS just being mediocre and underwhelming in every respect.A lot has been said in particular about the meta statements and the self-referentiality of this newest installment of the franchise. And while I definitely agree that most of it was heavy-handed and at least some of it shouldn't have made it into the final cut of the movie, I think the self-awareness is not necessarily the main problem here. It rather seems that a lot of winking towards the camera was used to disguise an ultimate lack of originality, ideas and talent, which is what characterizes the fourth MATRIX-film above all.The movie constantly denounces Hollywood's sequelitis, a rehashing of old ideas commercialized and trivialized in a seemingly never-ending loop - only to do exactly that for over two hours. THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS is filled to the brim with blockbuster tropes like odd comic reliefs, ultimately tells a very linear and uninspired story and - most inexcusably - does every technical aspect worse than the previous entries: This one got worse cinematography, worse editing, worse lighting, worse acting, worse music - you name it.As a result, the biggest problem of this film is its absence of purpose. Why did this story need to be told at all and why should anyone care? When you literally got Chad Stahelski in your team, but let the fight choreographies be handled by someone less talented and instead let him play some random side character named Chad (*wink* *wink*), you should probably rethink your whole project twice before rolling the camera.",4
594,After this film I feel the previous three films make no sense... so much done just to get a few machines on their side... pure unnecessary and rubbish of a movie.,1
595,Certainly not this movie. The first one from 1999 was groundbreaking and is watched in my household a couple times each year. The second and third installments were a bit scattered but still somewhat entertaining. The fourth is an abomination that should have never been made. Making the the first three movies video games dreamed up and created by Mr. Anderson is a terrible premise. The flashbacks through the first half of the movie is lazy writing. The only good thing about this movie is Keanu Reeves.,2
596,A waste of time. Felt like Lana Was milking a dry cow for three hours.This was a disservice to the brand and the actors who decided to return in it. Good that the two didn't.,3
597,"If you thought part 2 and 3 were bad, check this out. Part 4 feels like a low budget movie with terrible acting and dialogue. Even the effects looks terrible at times, especially slow motion. The movie starts off alright but it keeps getting worse and worse as it goes on.",5
598,Why do you do it? Why? Why continue logically sound trilogy? What for?? Do you believe you can fix second and third movie by making a forth one? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know?,3
599,"Well that was the worst Matrix movie. Yea. Feels low budget, almost like a documentary. Fan made ? But not a fan. Made by someone who hates Matrix, and hates the world.",1
600,"According to Neo, the problem is choice. But in Resurrections, the problem is writing. And it's a pretty big problem.The premise isn't necessarily terrible, but the execution is sophomoric at best, with a convoluted narrative, an excessive and clumsy reliance on nostalgia, disposable characters and a trite and deeply uninspired script.I rescue Neil Patrick Harris' character and performance. Beyond that, there is almost not redeeming value in this movie, whether you're looking for a fun action flick, an exciting sci-fi film or a worthy sequel to the original, Matrix Resurrections falls decidedly short on all fronts.",3
601,"Only to beat it with a stick and bury it six feet under. It was so long and slow. Too much talking not enough action.I didn't feel the energy behind what was supposed to be a revival of an iconic story.Neo and Trinity gave off a tired almost senile aura, as opposed to the iconic characters I once knew, and the entire movie felt like a romance instead of a sci fi/action.I do not understand why this movie was made. Why did they have to bring Neo and Trinity back?Also, this movie rode on the back of the trilogy (too much) instead of holding up itself, the story was overthought and confusing (not in a good way). If I were you I would skip this and (re)watch the original trilogy.Brb gonna go cry. :')",1
602,"I was very excited about new matrix,..I absolutely loved the series, even second and third one( which most people don't like) but this one was a joke...I don't know where to start, from dumb music, or ridiculous storyline, or feminist agenda or uninteresting action...glad I haven't watched it on cinema.",2
603,"The money spent on this garbage could have fed so many hungry people.Sorry that my review is short,i just watched the movie and it sucked all energy out of me. This is stupid on all levels that exist. The only bright point for me was to see Johnathan Groff perform,but even he couldn't add more in his constraints of this nonsense. Directing,SFX,script,acting,casting,all zero. I will pretend this doesn't exist,and Neo dies where he did in machine city,and will rather wonder til death what happened in that world after that.I'll rather dream about it than allow this to exist in my world.",1
604,"Nothing to see here people. The only watchable or remotely even interesting thing is the special effects. They spent so much money writting and producing this it hurts. They try to appeal to your emotions by showing you a couple different old characters and their ""new"" self, but I assure you, this was nothing interesting to watch. They were so desperate for plot and canon it eats away at you.And yes I did watch the whole thing HOPING for the story to change or make some sense. The ending was so cheap like they ran out of time and had to end it in a rush. It just keeps surprising me how this sort of thing gets funded and the people who are giving their money away to produce/see it.This garbage pretends to be something in the scifi/fantasy/epic genre, but it just bombs in a way that would make even Neo cry. Mr. Reeves must be embarrassed right now and even if he isn't, his performance was laughable at best. It's like, dude are you going for comedy or are you serious and the director just gave you horrible direction.Seriously all that money could have been used to feed a whole starving country or building schools and hospitals somewhere in a third world country. I feel as if this was supposed to feel like a rollercoaster and instead ended up feeling like the churro trolley on a NY subway platform. Cheap thrill.",1
605,"Well, here's another sequel no one asked for, but I went and saw it in the theater anyway because this is The matrix, the VHS cassette of which I watched like a hundred times, copied every line from, wore black sunglasses and loved with all my heart. The two sequels, I felt, were a little weaker but they nevertheless completed the trilogy and Neo's own story in the universe of the Matrix. But just like most of today back-from-the-dead movie franchises this one came back too - so, was it any good? Plenty.The matrix is built in the way that you can literally make the same movie with the same characters over and over again, then you reload it, revolutionize a bit and resurrect with a different name or a numeral. This one's no exception, it even mocks its own world half the time, and I love it when authors use self-irony as a creative tool, to the reasonable extent naturally. The matrix resurrections manages to be both a self-parody and a continuation, a new story and a remake, and in being both it loses the core of what the Matrix really is.It's great to see Keanu and Carrie-Anne back in their roles but I felt they were forced on them, as though the connection was lost and they tried to recreate the previous magic but I just couldn't feel it. The new characters on the other hand were way more alive and exciting, Neil Patrick Harris and Jonathan Groff both managed to fit in the roles left by another actors perfectly and bring them to a whole new level of greatness and outshone, in a way, lead characters.I'm also feeling the story isn't over yet, and we are facing yet another trilogy and I hope it gets better because after this one the only feeling I got was that it needs to change, and a lot. Watching a 2+ hour movie of filler talk and a to-be-continued story is hardly an exercise in brain breaking (the way the first three movies were) and I want to begin to believe again that there could be more to the universe I love.",8
606,"Its sad when young blood want to make a name for themselves by taking legendary pieces of the past and ruining them. Not to mention the damage that is done to the magic that the talented actors got together in the first 3 movies.This movie in no world deserves more than a 5, really wanted to take the blue pill on this one and continue to live only in the first 3 masterpieces.",3
607,"If you want me to summarize this film in one sentence I would say: ""It is an obvious cash grab made for younger, clueless audience and not for actual hardcore fans of the original movie.""Just like what ""The Hobbit"" is for ""The Lord of The Rings"". They rehashed some famous things like ""white rabbit, blue pill vs red pill, stopping bullets in the air"" and overused the crap out of them to also cash in the nostalgia. But it is done so ridiculously, repetitively and is so obvious. Nothing original here.There's also this stupid constant playback of iconic scenes of original movie here and there. Why? Oh of course, you want generation Z to get familiarize themselves with the original movie.They try to appeal to younger generation by choosing certain modern aesthetics, writing and directing aspects and that sets this movie far apart from the gritty, dark Matrix we all got used to and loved.Plot holes, horrible writing, bad directing. All in all, avoid at all costs.",1
608,Primitive farce. Incredibly disgusting. Unimaginably pathetic.Why did Keanu agree to star in this parody? The Matrix Resurrections is an insult not only to fans of the original film but to the industry as a whole.,1
609,"I agree with pretty much all the negatives people are pointing out about this movie. For a product that cost a reported 190 million dollars, it's bad to a fascinating level.But what I also find interesting is the real world story. The original Matrix movie is the pinnacle of the art. And then the well went dry. The Wachowskis made one of the greatest science fiction movies ever and, since then, have made nothing but garbage. But millions of us(including Warner Brother executives) are desperately hoping that the magic will return.As a society, I believe we should accept that the dream is over. Outside of the original Matrix trilogy the Wachowcki movies are horrible and lose about 50 million dollars apiece. They need to be put out to pasture.Sad, but the sooner we all take the red pill and accept reality, the happier we'll be in the long run.",3
610,"The original trilogy was coherent unlike the current iteration. The plot, was confusing, jumped around, and the first hour was forced, boring and did not do much to set the tone, mood, or anything else regarding the plot.Could have easily been a good movie if everything wasn't forced and there was some semblance of a timeline.",3
611,"So out of just respect to the legacy of the Matrix and in love of Keane Reeves only I gave it a rating of 6/10 .. but to wait for post credit scene thinking that this movie might still redeem itself by something.. anything in the post credit scene at the end to find this joke .. Catrix!! Really this is what you came with after holding your fans and viewers for over 7 minutes waiting for a restructuring scene that maybe just maybe result in some sort of anything good .. after an annihilation of boring sounds effects, no sort of choreography whatsoever just having NEW blocking by his hands more than 25 times in the same move, the swarm is just as tens or hundreds of zombie scenes that have been produced before, there is literally nothing good or even close to good.",2

Awful.... Nothing original to see here. Why 2 stars? Because there's some particle VFX characters that are nifty - still NOT original. Sad...",2
614,"The Matrix franchise has always been a hit or miss, and it is one of those productions that could live without the sequels. The first film was revolutionary in its vision, style, and groundbreaking action. The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions weren't able to live up to the heights of the first one. The Matrix Resurrections fall into the same pit. The film is nothing short of an unnecessary disappointment, which should never have been green-lit. It has nothing to say other than try to reintroduce the audience to nostalgia, which fails miserably. I gotta say, the first twenty minutes are good, but when the movie starts to expand, it becomes a shell of itself. We have a couple of old faces playing Matrix titular characters, but they never succeed due to a lack of good writing. While Jonathan Groff and Yahya Abdul-Mateen are both good actors, they weren't able to fill the shoes that Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving left. These two guys in this movie could've made a difference just with their knack for understanding the characters. They were sadly absent from The Matrix Resurrections.The Matrix Resurrections run for two hours and twenty-eight minutes. It is a long movie that never manages to pull the strings together and go with the flow. It is a nightmare to get past the last fifty minutes. Visually, the world of Matrix feels a bit larger in Resurrections as it establishes a couple of high-tech components that weren't discussed in previous entries. There is action and a lot of explosions, but the choreography and camera movement are not on the same page. Dull fist fights with too many slow-motion effects that can get on your nerves. I did not expect this movie to be a technical masterpiece, but having moments that I could remember would've made this a bit more worthwhile and watchable. I appreciate the movie trying to be a productive attempt, but I did not enjoy this in the slightest bit. This was definitely not for me.",3
615,This was an absolute pointless movie. Like Star Wars they found a way to bypass death and relive again while destroying the trilogy. Ignore there sequel movies.,1

How this film is even real? Or is it made just for America Late night Show as some joke? I cant believe this movie is real. For this kind of brand everyone will give anything, best CGI artists, best deals and so on. Like on reddit there is thousands of fan scripts with deeper and better ideas, BUT NO - they made one of the worst sequels off all times.In some bad movies you can find something good, maybe there is good soundtracks, maybe acting is good, maybe camerawork, maybe color correction, maybe some new ideas, but in this movie nothing was new, nothing was good, nothing was interesting, everything was bad, plain bad movie, JUST everything starting from costumes even ending titles was sad, I know that this Film will be bad, but this bad?! And Zero Plots twists, zero effort film.The worst thing is that every new TV show have better production quality than this s*** - Matrix R******d. 21 year old movie is just pure gold now. I cant even spoil something, even if I told you all what I seen....P. S. I'm giving +one star because I'm started to believe that with all this pandemic nonsense and this movie we truly live in some Windows 95 simulation.P. S.2.

620,"The original Matrix is one of those many movies that should have been left alone without even thinking of pulling off any kind of sequel.The next two parts that came along only gave testament to that by solely managing to make a total mess out of it.The Matrix Resurrections which came 17 years after the third part totally flashed the franchise down the toilet.Clearly, Wachowski was short on cash after the operation and released this rip-off to even out.I watched it on my friend's cable and I am so happy I didn't spend any money on this sheer piece of junk.Reeves would be much better off staying with the John Wick series.",2
621,"Terrible! Of course the movie it will be a flop! I never liked Matrix series! I think those movies are the most overrated movies out there! Someone says: ""just a money grab"" What ""money grab""? It will be a flop! It looks like Keanu doesn't want to be in this movie!",1
622,"What a waste. Sophistication, sharpness, precision, purpose, originality, that's what made the original trilogy so epic. You find none of this in Resurrections. The scenario has some ""good"" ideas, but when you think ""Matrix"", your ideas better be ""amazing"". And it's the same for the cgi. One thing I loved the Wachowskis brothers for, is how precisely they're playing with the viewer's feelings till the big ending fireworks (Matrix 1, Speed Racer), and here we find nothing of the sort, did the ""wrong"" brother got to do the movie? Did they need each other to create such epic-ness? I don't know...",3
623,"This movie is a failiure on such a global scale we rarely get to see. The writers I believe whole heartedly hate their original creation. They definitely do their best to disrupt and change ideas, concepts and even the ideology of their creation. It is very strange for me to see such a big budget destruction of such a cultivating and tantalising franchise. The matrix stole the imagination and dreams of so many, it was so captivating and this is a complete destruction of what was created. They destroy so many fundamental characteristics of the whole franchise its ridiculous.Spoiler from here: they have destroyed THE ONE, they have gotten rid of the notion of the one and made it so it no longer exists. They have also transfered some powers of the one to Trinity such as flying which is strange considering she never once defeated an agent in one on one combat in the same way as neo no one did but now she can easily. They created a character called bug who was as powerful as morpheus if not more so. She dodged automatic weapons with ease without even needing special effects, slow motion or bullets tracks to show her ability. She just sort of does it in real time. Despite the fact she cannot even defeat an agent in combat. Morpheus is now some sort of program dissimulation and it touches on the subject but doesn't fully explain it. Also you have friendly machines with looks and names similar to Pokemon, red pills are no longer an option they just say take them. This film is about female power I believe it references it multiple times and also give 3 scenes to explaining consent and makes a huge song and dance about consent. The movie as a whole entity made me laugh, it has allot of real world issues packed into a movie to prove a point, this in my opinion, it was not about the matrix and it is about the directors displeasure with how people interpreted their vision such as was said in open dialog a few times before neo takes the red pill. In conclusion this is gross mis representation of audience and seems to attack people whom enjoyed the original creation and have theorised about the bigger meaning of it. Don't see it. Let it tank, just watch it for free on a streaming site down the road. Honestly !!!!!!",1
624,"What could have been a huge success was really turned into a terrible mess. The easy critiques are...1. Woke Jokes- blue hair lady complaining about the ""binary"" choice of the red/blue pill decision. Obviously comparing two totally different things for zero effect. There are no 3rd choices in choosing to know reality or choosing to be ignorantly blissful.2. 4th wall humor was terrible. Making Matrix Warner Brothers ask for a 4th game like they asked for a 4th movie and then joking that it would be ""fresh"" is unbearable in conjunction with the next critique.3. SO MANY throwbacks that nothing new was ever created. You get almost 1/2 way through before anything new arrives. And even then, it's not that mind blowing.4. There are more, but I'll skip to the big stuff.The actual core critique is that the ending makes no sense. Neo has always been ""the one"" but isn't anymore. He has some sort of inability to perform under pressure, and Trinity all the sudden becomes powerful with little to no explanation why. Now there are two ""ones"" which can alter The Matrix and plan on waking everyone up (I guess?). But even then, people will wake up in a machine world with not enough food for everyone. Also, thr machines that now work with the humans will be fighting against their own existence if all the humans are set free.In short- What a total waste of 2.5 hours. This series is totally dead. Boo. Hiss. Double thumbs down. Will never watch again.",1
625,"First, forget nearly everything you know (and expect from) about ""The Matrix"" when you going to see this film. ""Resurrections"" feels like more of an ironic re-imagining of a first film and parody of it - at the same time.Such a change of tone could easily be accepted had authors not been pushing same nostalgic buttons again and again. But it appears like director Lana Wachowski tries way too hard to make a direct sequel of ""The Matrix"", which looks totally different for no apparent reasons.What even more of a problem, is the amount of jokes (silly for the most part), which highly contrasts not only with previous film, but also with seriousness of explanations and high stakes in this film. There's kinda extended prologue filled with gags about ""The Matrix"" and its impact on pop-culture. There is also an updated version of Morpheus with very light-hearted attitude. And so on, and so on...However, presence of Lana Wachowki in scriptwriting team helps to maintain some continuity from original films. There will be quite interesting pieces on human nature and tendency to express one's fullness only in love to another human being. Also, what is even more intriguing, The Matrix (and its chief representative, The Analyst) now is unafraid of a human rebellion, since it calculates that most people will stay in simulation just because they cannot handle hardships of choice and reality in general. So Neo and Trinity can be superheroes, it does matter not that much - or The Analyst is trying to picture it that way.So, it's not a masterpiece not in any way possible. But it has its moments. Especially if you open-minded enough to accept the fact it is more like a love story now.",7
626,"I hope the next Matrix movie is called ""Matrix: Redone"", where they remake this into a proper movie. This cannot compare in any way to the first three installments. That's all I have to say about it.",5
627,"3 stars for the come back of Neo and Trinity...as for the rest of the movie, let's not insult peoples intelligence.Just bring them back, we don't need a big story. We don't need Pinkett-Smith pretending to be smart and old telling us some sob story. We don't need a 1 hour fight scene with Smith AGAIN! Oh my god, does anyone not look at their watch during the Neo/Smit fight scenes?He's killing him. No he's not. Oh yes he is. No no he's not. Also, the analyst seems to have this power Neo can't beat but when it comes time to need it he's all, ""duh what do I do?""Also, lame ending. Terrible movie. Just terrible. What were they thinking? At least Cats was over in 80 minutes. This is a disaster.",3
628,"The first 15-20min was promising even though some what confusing. I kept flipping back and forth between the idea that the matrix was just a game Neo invented and the writers were going to play the mental illness card. This wasn't the case but after Morpheus is introduced into the movie the whole thing just dives off a cliff and you might as well just turn it off.The acting by the nostalgic characters alone was atrocious and a major cringe. Neo is a F'n zombie, Morpheus is a joke, they made Naomi into a grumpy pirate and Merovingian into a hobo. Trinity has decent acting but the writing for her lines is ridiculous. The line where she says ""don't call me that, my name is Trinity"" right after she tells Neo it's too late, hard cringe. The rest did ok with Bugs being the most convincing.The writing was so poor, that I think fans could come up with a better script within 24 hours.The fight scenes which made the originals so special are so forced. Neo can't fight anymore even though he says ""I still know Kung Fu"". He's only good for blocking bullets and 2 out bursts of the old Neo. The fight scene remake between Neo and Morpheus is all cringe and should be deleted. The explosion at the end, WTF was that.The whole pill taking process is ""just take this"", there is no urgency or weight on it.No one fears agents anymore and seems like everyone can fight them now. Why have them there anyways? They constantly miss, they are not anymore dangerous then the random civilians. Pretty much useless.Agent Smith is his own entity now and roams the Matrix and saves Neo and Trinity. Really???? You gonna have the biggest nemesis save them so they can ""repaint the matrix with rainbows"" and change his world too?Neo dies in M3 to save Zion and humanity. Zion replaced by Io because of some internal policies BS. ""There was peace but not really, but there really was a little, thanks Neo. Morpheus died believing in you.""Some machines feel bad for humans now so they help them. LOLMorpheus is a program Neo created in his game which is inside the Matrix but he is also now in the actual Matrix and can project him self in the real world through some new tech. WTF They should have left Morpheus out, let him die a legacy after M3. The new guy did his character a major disservice.Neo is actually nothing special in this one. All he does the last 20 min of the movie is stops bullets with his epic scene from the original matrix, over and over and over and over again.It is super easy to get into the machine city these days and wake up the two most valuable assets they have. Why did bugs have to be swapped with Trinity and was able to leave is beyond me. The pulled up a ship right next to his bay INSIDE machine city and used a friendly pet machine to gently place him inside the ship. LMFAOThe analyst just got bulldozed at the end without a fight? Trinity and Neo flies away into the sunset holding hands? GTFOTrinity is the new Neo now. Enough said.By the way at least 1/8 of the movie is flashbacks of the old movies. Which LITERALLY only makes you want to turn this off and actually go watch the originals.I can keep going but this just gets worse and worse the more I think about it. So I am going to stop now. This Matrix movie is the equivalent of Terminator Genisys. Another childhood classic ruined.",2
629,"Half of the movie were old video clips on the first Matrix. 😐 I ended up leaving almost 2hours in. I was hoping the movie would evolve and get better, it didn't. There was a scene pitching a new idea for the new Matrix video game and let's just say the scene was referring to the movie itself. Honestly I thought it was a parody.",3
630,"According to IMDB, this absolute masterpiece bagged a whopping $4,600 on opening day in Vietnam.Reports indicate the next film has already been confirmed and yes, Keanu has said he will reprise his role as Neo so long as the Vietnamese continue to come out in droves to show their support.One Vietnamese movie go-er had this to say about the new Matrix, and specifically Keanu:""Ma tran that khung khiep va khong can thiet. Keanu nen cam thay hoi xau ho vì da dang ky. Nhu nguoi xua co cau: ""An thit ga, cuu mot mang nguoi.""""",1
631,"This movie depressed me so much, I could not bring myself to finish it. From the trailer you could tell it was going to be bad but oh my gosh I was not expecting a combination of Scary Movie and The Matrix that adds up to a stupid and confusing semi action movie plus a boring and insipid love story with Bollywood levels of video production. Absolutely shameless!",1
632,"This movie does not feel like the Matrix movie. It lacks everything that the other 3 had. There is no substance, no story, no mystery, no nothing a bore of the movie.I felt nothing for any of the characters during the movie that includes Neo and Trinity. The story made no sense, there is no the solemnity of the event, just a ship picking up Neo, the one, the messiah ... and no one really cares .. they have strawberries now, so who cares.Main villain and Morpheus is just a comic relief.I would compare that movie to clean up after a festival: You in the same place, there still stages around, you remember fun you had on previous days but now there in no more music, no more fun, no more people, there is just rubbish lying around, it all feels like a chore and You just wanna to go back home.But no one is asking the clean-up crew to pay for tickets, in this instance audience should be paid for watching this movie, not other way aroud.",3
633,It is an absolute garbage. I don't know why they had to come back 20 years later and ruin one of the best trilogies of al time. No creativity no original ideas. I wish i could forget it all. I was so excited first but after watching 5 minutes I realised this movie is either a joke or someone is just ok to put out garbage.,1
634,Watched the trilogy and played the games. This film was garbage. So much vagueness On the world building and story. Felt no stakes or intimidation by the new architect. 60 years in the future from the last film and hardly touched on what happened and left more questions. The film being self aware and meta was cringe and not clever as they thought it would be. It depends solely on nostalgia rather than story and continuation of the plot. Lana is a terrible writer. I even read that the original matrix was sued by a woman that said the wachowskis plagiarized her. Going from perfect to this dumpster fire makes me believe it. Especially with Jupiter ascending added to the list of garbage writing. I don't understand how anyone could like this that is a huge fan like me. Many people feel the same thank God so hopefully Warner fire some people and never let Lana write a thing again unless she comes out with some short films that brings confidence back.,2
635,"I don't usually leave reviews, but this movie was just so terrible I felt I had to let people know not to waste their time.Wife and I lasted 40 mins before turning it off in utter boredom.As a long time fan of the original trilogy I really wanted to like this one, but I couldn't.The colour grading is just awful. Would suite a rom com, but this isn't a rom com, this is the matrix...",3
636,"This is a shame but also just confirmation that The Matrix was a one off. It should have been left alone, no trilogy and definitely 4th. I don't even know what the point of it was? Was it simply to do the first one again... kinda but really not? Who knows.This just shouldn't have happened and I can't understand why Keanu signed up to it. Pointless, gimmicky, too much effort put into nostalgia. Cringe and despair is all I can feel.The science behind Morpheus character is pretty cool though.I gave it a 5, mainly because I watched it to the end but I don't think it deserved it if I'm honest.",5
637,"You have countless untapped plot holes to a ridiculously great story that is the perfect amount of complicated, amusing, imaginable, yet the Wachowski brothers seem to have been bitten by whatever had infected Hollywood.Terrible acting, artificial (lame as well) misplaced humor, excessive focus on VFX that it looks silly and not even superb. Mentioning silliness, the movie failed from the very beginning to make you take it seriously as its predecessors. DISENGAGINGThe script and plot were unbelievably disappointing so much that characters like Smith and Neo sounded so silly and you feel there's no connection whatsoever to the original character arcs. And the character playing Morpheous is so moronic and goofy that it is insulting. The characters are so casual that it's almost a satire much more so than a sequel.The actors were terrible, especially Keanu and Moss.What a disgrace to one of the best tales ever.",1
638,"In this movie they actually find Nea!I don't know why a review should contain one hundred and fifty characters but I will try to fill the empty space.Neo cannot fly anymore he can do electromagnetic fields but do not worry Neo like Morpheus will find ""the one"" able to fly.... NEA!",1
639,"... because this is HOT GARBAGE.Everyone involved in this should be donkey punched, and I'm not sorry, that includes Keanu.I'm not even going to bother going into detail how moronic this is.Do yourself a favor and hot pass.",1
640,"This movie was an okay film, but it that great like the first original movie. Don't get me wrong, The Matrix is still a true classic, compared to Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss performance from there previous films over the years after. But for this year, they still nailed there part as Neo and Trinity. Even tho there getting a little older as you think. Lana Wachowski involved with the fourth installment and tries to connect the story of how Neo and Trinity got resurrected and clearly not the exact story of what we think it is at some point. Some people still enjoys the Matrix and some people are quite disappointed, but I'm not gonna give anything away.",8
641,"Even thought my expectations were at a all time low i needed to go and witness this film for myself. As a avid supporter of the previous films, i needed to evidence the plummet. And the fall from grace was sizeable!!!Script terribleCast terrible except chopra, henwick, sequoiaActing terribleScreenplay terribleCharacter progression terribleChoreography terribleDIRECTING terribleScenes, visuals etc were all obnoxious, this was a mockery...laurence you missed a bullet!!!",1
642,"I've started this movie three different times and I've never made it past the first forty-five minutes. It's such a self-parody, so much so that New Morpheus says something like ""I wasn't sure if the callback would work or not."" I've got zero interest in restarting for a fourth time.",3
643,"Total rubbish - except for when Neo and Trinity get together. Bad script, poor casting (Neil Harris as the villain?), disjointed and 'forced'. To say this is woke and will fail is obvious - the question is why. Clearly 'Lilly' is the talented sister and Lana should have stuck to painting. There will only be 3 Matrix movies in my collection - same as there is only 1 Speed movie.",4
644,A nice old tried and true concept wrapped up in pure garbage. I wish i could unsee this movie. I want 2 and a half hours of my life back.Bad pacing. Bad editing. Bad cinematography. Hundreds of plot holes. Bad acting by a lot of the actors. Lazy script and woke direction. Pure torture.,2
645,"I knew this was going to be bad going in. I watched this to try and conquer boredom during downtime at work and because I forgot to cancel HBO Max (again). Full disclosure is I am not a Matrix fan at all though, at the time - twenty-two years ago, I did enjoy the first film.Where to begin? I guess first off is the fact that a movie shouldn't be made just to make it. This is clearly a case of a cash grab that, these days, is all to common - with a never ending parade of sequels. The plot of this thing is a convoluted mess while somehow being paper thin. Why is there a new actor playing Morpheus? If everyone but Neo and Trinity aged 60 years they could have easily had Laurence Fishburne reprise his role. This depiction of Morpheus is just horrid. The pacing with the action just feels artificial; the same old stuff you see in big budget flicks like Star Wars where the protagonists turn right just in time as the adversaries show up and then turn left for more of the same (this is the kind of stuff you see in cartoons for kids - it's that bad). The bad attempts at humor with that French guy were so bad they were funny. The parody of Warner Bros forcing the making Matrix IV was also awful - one could only wish maybe there is some truth lurking somewhere in there. The legacy of these Matrix films brought us tired slow motion that is now beyond cliche and yet, despite this fact, it's here again in spades.Film making as an art has been in rapid decline, at least to me over the last decade. There are so many rehashes and sequels, and so little creativity and innovation in story telling, that it's mind numbing - but I suppose that is what the masses want. In my opinion a film has to justify its existence - which most films do not. This just jumped to the head of that list.",2
646,"So let me start from the good part; the action scenes are good and the movie has some originality, for the better or the worst.Nothing else works. The story, the dialogue and never ending jokes are cringe.A director should always put their personality in a movie, but when it comes to a sequel it should be done for the fans and that's not what happens here. The director's view doesn't work in that universe anymore, it feels like the 20+ years of fan theories and speculations didn't matter, where even the movies tone doesn't feel right.Buggs is the best part of the movie. Morpheus and Smith are laughable, in a bad way.",2
647,"Should've left it the way it was, this was weak and it just ruined the Matrix name.I've seen a few Keanu Reeves movies but this is probably the weakest, not even sure why he accepted to play a part in this.",4
648,"The Matrix Resurrections is a movie too late to the party. Probably the reason why it has bombed at the box office. I think Warner Brothers have miscalculated the real interest in this franchise.However I believe myself to be a fan but even I was sceptical especially considering how dire the sequels were. Resurrections is no better and whilst it starts out promising it soon becomes apparent that this whole concept is a tired one that has run its course, relying heavily on nostalgia. Even Keanu Reeves as Neo couldn't be bothered to get a shave and a hair cut for his character showing the lack of enthusiasm that this movie generates.Resurrections is a bunch of old ideas repackaged to look like it is cutting edge.Whilst Lana Wachowski may have had a few inspired ideas here and there they never come to any fruition and this movie will be forgotten by the time credits roll.It's sad really, especially for fans of the original movie like myself.If you haven't had the chance to see the remastered 4K Blu-ray of the original Matrix then I suggest you save your cash on a movie ticket for Resurrections and go out and buy the original on 4K.It was nice to see Keanu and Carrie back in their famous roles but the absence of Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving in their respective roles certainly didn't go unnoticed. In fact I believe that this was just another nail in the coffin as to why this film fails. Nostalgia is all well and good and the creators rely heavily. Sad that they neglected to bring back two of the movies major players replacing them with two sub par forgettable performances by actors I haven't really heard of.I apologise for my negativity. I really wanted to love this but there's nothing here to get a fans juices flowing. Even the action scenes are stale.Neo constantly repeats his ability to stop bullets to the extent where Keanu spends most of the movie with his armsout in front of him like he's startled by headlights or trying to push an imaginary gate open. Even the Kung Fu scenes offer little joy. Choreography is sparse as if Reeves is saving his energy for the forthcoming John Wick 4 movie.To sum up The Matrix Resurrections is a pointless retread down memory lane. Sadly someone has gone and built a sewage plant down there resulting in one big pile of crap!",4
649,"Not sure why movie nowadays really aren't good anymore. I couldn't even follow this movie, too many flashbacks and not enough heart. I gave it 4 stars only because it was streaming. Saved me a trip to the theater. A very flat and forgetful movie. Will be avoiding this director and the writers from now on.",4
650,The studio (WB) released a bad movie to spite a filmmaker with Justice League (2017). This time around the filmmaker released a bad movie to spite a studio and you can't convince me otherwise (It's even on record). Who is in charge of Warner Bros that keeps making these decisions? Making unnecessary sequels/changes.If you're a pro wrestling fan this is what would happen if you gave Vince Russo free reign on a movie script. Nothing makes sense in this. It is barely a movie and more like a filler episode of a tv show used to recap the events up until now. Stay Away.,3
651,"The film was a collection of slow-motion scenes with a bad taste in fashion. I can say that if you see a fight scene from this movie, you no longer need to see the rest. They are all alike and I got bored and had to fast forward some of the fight scenes. For god's sake, It's a matrix movie and I had to fast-forward It, that's just bad.",3
652,"The first half was ok. It didn't build any excitement sorts, but I was curious as to find how it will unfold and ""what is going on"". But in the last fifteen minutes, I felt I am watching a comedy movie. Suddenly, the matrix movie feel is gone and I started seeing everything in a comic way.",4
653,"Aside from the fact that the viewer needs to have a PHD in computer science and programming to understand the first 45 minutes of this so called sequel. This is not a good film.Keanu Reeves is the only recognizable face in this ridiculously scripted attempt at a blockbuster.The premise makes no sense and with our hero only existing to bring back a lost love; Carrie Moss. While learning that everything is a computer program constructed by the computer system mafia represented by Jada Pinkett Smith, Telfair Hopkins, and the former star of""Doogie Houser"" this mess is totally unbelievable and certainly not worth the $25 you might spend to leave the comfort of your viewing room to see this among strangers.The script is confusing, direction is by the book, the rest is predictably dull. And still unbelievable.""And can anyone explain why Neo looks a lot like John Wick?I won't watch this again!",5
654,If this movie wasn't apart of the matrix series I would've enjoyed it but it is and it doesn't feel or look like a matrix movie at all. Casting was bad and the plot became 10 times more confusing than before. The sense 8 team basically threw up all over it.,4
655,"Gender swapped garbage. Just like the Wachowski brothers. The story was weak, the fighting choreography was absolutely abysmal and brought me back to the late 80's, far inferior to the original series. Trinity is now more powerful than Neo? Again, more politicized garbage. There is zero back story or foundation, just more recycled footage from the original trilogy. The Wachowski brothers should have left it alone, instead, the Wachowskisisters? Tried to resurrect something that they should have left dead and done. I haven't seen something more disappointing from them since Jupiter Ascending.",3
656,"I'm an hour into this movie, and found out that everything I watched as a teenager on into my early 20's in the matrix franchise has been completely undone. The war is still going on, the Oracle has been ""purged"", Morpheus is a program and when Trinity and Neo sacrificed their lives...they didn't really sacrifice their lives. I don't know how they got Keanu to do this movie, but it really looks like he's bored. It honestly seems like he could care less about this movie. I might try to finish this movie some day, but right now watching this movie is just pissing me off!",1
657,"What I find amazing about this film is not that it's actually the story that is the issue here, but how incredibly bad the technical execution of this film is considering it's budget. The cinematography is some of the worst the age of digital cinematography has to offer. I can only imagine that essential action perspective have been shot with inferior cameras just to make it easier to set up, because the final image on screen just looks absolutely garbage, especially this blurry fake digital motion blur. The staging and editing of scenes is of particularly low quality as well compared to how tightly and stylish almost all scenes in the original have been designed and all of this combined just makes this film one huge disappointment and a pill that's hard to swallow. Just avoid it if you can.",1
658,"This movie doesn't even deserve a review. Just don;t pay to see it. Download it if you can but be warned. Watching the torrent download is way more entertaining that the movie itself.It gets a 2, instead of 1 because we have Keanu. Even if he seems to be embarrassed to be there in the first place.The entire movie feels as a poorly written fan-fiction movie thought out by a confused, talentless writer.Avoid.",2
659,"I had a my doubts but I also had high hopes. I wasn't expecting it to be this bad at all. Where was all the cool cinematography? All the cool fights combined with camera magic that separated the matrix from all the other action films. Like most have already said obvious money grab, poor script, unnecessary movie, and as a fan I'm going to pretend like I've never watched this movie.",1
660,"(1) Maybe, just MAYBE, this movie would have had a chance. Even not quite so: This concept would have a chance... But it showed itself the reality we received with the phrases of its characters: ""For what is needed to take the old code and to make something new?"" ... ""For those who like to eat ***"" ... ""They took your story and devalued it"" ... ""Everything we did ... was in vain"". What was it, self-sarcasm, joking on viewers and fans? (2) Morpheus from a cool and charismatic ""pastor of the dark matrix centuries"" has turned into a clown-finch. (3) Agent Smith: the way that actor played him in old movies, fixed in the subconscious that's how good he played that role... the new actor simply trampled on all that with his ""tricksy"" playing. (4) They tear out of the souls and memory of an already completely finished iconic story, in order to pervert it. There are not enough hands and faces in the World to show my FacePalm.",3
661,"If there was zero stars rating I would have rated this movie zero. That's what it deserves. The movie was boring, the plot was daft. The only good thing about this movie is the CGI. They should have just let the past remain I the past cause this resurrection is such a let down. Please don't waste your time watching this cause there's nothing entertaining about it.",1
662,"I actually found the trailers before the film more exciting.How to take a great franchise and completely ruin it! I own the other 3 dvds and watch them often, this pile of rubbish i will never watch again!",2
663,"The original sequels I'll grant you are not without their problems. The first Matrix was a phenomenon. It holds up decades later not just with its VFX, but it's pacing, story-telling and actors all shining. I have a bit more love for Reloaded than most it seems; maybe not matching the first in terms of story but definitely has some of the most eye-catching and memorable visuals/action sequences. Revolutions was a bit all over the place and the weakest of the three imo, but it still had our favourite characters coming together for one final almighty battle and it tries to tie things off...with varying success.Resurrections badly, badly needed Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. They were easily as integral to the success of the first three as Neo and Trinity were and they are sorely missed here. The character of 'Morpheus' here just looks like a poor man's version of the original and for some reason was written with an almost mocking tone towards some of the most iconic Morpheus scenes. Strange decision for sure and one that I don't think works.The new 'Smith' as well is an even paler and more pathetic imitation and cannot hold a candle to the character Hugo Weaving expertly brought to life. I'm actually still not entirely sure what Smith's role was in this movie other than to be a callback which brings me to the next problem: SO. Many. Callbacks. Nostalgia is a powerful tool, and one or two moments can work well. Neo's ""I still know kung-fu"" is one such moment of well-applied nostalgia. One of, sadly, very few well-applied moments. Honestly the first two thirds of the movie is full of callback after callback after flashback. Too many carbon copy scenes it almost feels like we're re-watching the first movie with just subtle tweaks and new faces. Now you could argue it was intentional to play on the theme of deja-vu, but it went overboard.If the first two thirds are just a re-hashing of the first movie, the last third is a mess of flimsy plot and action sequences which don't really wow and actually look less impressive than the 20yr old ones. Neo has got one new trick, but he never reaches the level of bad-assery of being The One. And as one other reviewer noted, the ending suddenly foregoes 'The One' for 'The Pair' with Trinity seemingly able to do everything Neo can which goes completely against the Matrix concept. It could've worked though; Neo and Trinity so linked in destiny and important to each other that she's become just as big an anomaly as he especially in the latest version of the Matrix as explained in the movie that relies on both of them to maintain balance. But it was worked into the final few minutes with a weird sequence that just felt out of place.You could pick apart more that's wrong but really it'd be just kicking a man while he's down. I liked the first 20min or so; showing how the Matrix has reset and has worked the events of the trilogy into Neo's new simulation in a hiding-in-plain-sight cover was cool. And the callbacks were nice until they became overwhelming, also good were the few moments where the soundtrack hit the iconic original score. I was hoping for the last third we'd get Neo realizing as The One; give us the original look and wardrobe with Trinity, the two of them side by side fighting. Minimize the callbacks in the rest of the movie and have the climax and fighting at the end burst with nostalgia - a release of anticipation that would've built up during the movie. Instead we got them for 3min right at the end in that weird sequence with Neil Patrick Harris and Keanu spends most of the time in John Wick-guise. It could've been worse yes, but in the end all it did was make me long to go back and watch the originals.",5
664,"Obviously, Lana was very miffed about Netflix's surprise cancellation of Sense8 due to the massive budget requirement. Thus, reformulating and repackaging unmade episodes into Matrix Resurrections with several actors and actresses plucked from Sense8.The first third of the film was more of longest ""previous episode"" clip as to refreshen our befuddled brains what the first three Matrix were about. The second half was a stale buffet of the ground-breaking special effects and stunts from the first Matrix films as if Lana can't come up with new ideas. Even the costume design is so laughably unoriginal.Nothing new. What a heap of disjointed and fumbling narration and dialogues. I would have given it 1 star, but I added one more star for the CGI visual effect.In my opinion, Lana should have left Matrix Trilogy alone...",2
665,"And yes that means I've picked up my phone while watching it. I read a few reviews before hand so lowered my expectations as low as I could!This movie feels like the cheap knock off TV show that follows the success of a movie. Because it is all over the place, without an identity or direction. It is shot digitally so looks like a film shot on iPhone and the original composer isn't involved, as a result the soundtrack is empty and quiet.Its all wrong! And has no stakes, I'm not intimidated by the new antagonist because he has no power and 20 mins of flashbacks to the old movies, does not a new movie make!If you enjoy the Matrix, watch the original trilogy because this is not a resurrection, this should be called The Matrix Regresses.",3
666,"You know, I like the Matrix and was very excited for it. I saw the trailer and it looked promising, but this was not worth my time.It simply felt empty, something was missing. I would not recommend watching this movie unless you want to feel completely and utterly disappointed.",3
667,Quite bad in every aspect of what they Matrix triology was. Never been disappointed to this extent. From camera movements to effects to storyline to..to...to. Everything was quite disappointing. Felt as if the movie was made by an amateur or someone who had no clue about the Matrix triology. Bad.,1
668,"The Good: This may sound weird, but I kind of enjoyed the meta-ness of this movie (to a point, which I'll elaborate on later). I don't see how you could make this movie without that element. I also really enjoyed the final set piece from a purely visual and kinetic standpoint. It was really fun.The Bad: Unfortunately, there isn't much else to appreciate about Resurrections. Despite Lana Wachowski's incredibly meta dialog, where the movie constantly points at itself and says, ""yes, we know this is a soulless, unnecessary cash grab,"" not much comes out of it. This movie is almost an exact imitation of the original Matrix, with actual shot for shot recreations and actual footage from that film taking up a shockingly high amount of the runtime.Resurrections also has this peculiar tendency of basically destroying the narrative that came before it, ala the new Star Wars. It makes no sense for Neo's story to continue, there's nothing new or interesting to really say here. For the filmmakers to make such a big deal about pointing out how unnecessary this movie is, yet to do nothing interesting with it, is its cardinal sin in my opinion. There's even an extended dialog sequence where Neo is told why it's okay for this film to exist and how his sacrifice actually meant something. Alright.Not to mention the (deliberately, apparently) ugly action scenes and boring visuals. Remember the kinetic, revolutionary action sequences you know and love? Forget about that. We get possibly the worst and least visually interesting fight scenes I've seen in a while. There's something about an aging Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss clearly being unable to perform stunts like they used to that's just depressing.And, it's also disappointing how the movie gives us incredibly forgettable, blah characters - most of whom are interchangeable - and expects us to view them as stand ins for the originals. We get a worse Morpheus, a worse Agent Smith, a worse Architect...yawn.If there's a cherry on top, we don't even get a clear sense of what this movie means or where the story is going from here. Not only is this film basically comprised of two rescues, but it's entirely centered on Neo and Trinity's supposedly undying love for one another. (Which is weird, because I highly doubt anyone came from the Matrix films thinking this minor subplot was the heart of the movie) There isn't much new ground to cover, we don't even really know who the villain is, what the central conflict is...the movie just sort of ends.The Ugly: I officially do not want to see any of these soft reboots. We're getting to the 2000s now (in terms of filmic nostalgia) and the past decade has been basically entirely comprised of remaking and rebooting better movies. I honestly worry about the future of Hollywood blockbusters and M4 is precisely why.",3
669,"The parody is the movie, the tragedy is the sellout, and the motive is money.What a farce to try and reboot the franchise with such slapstick action, superimposing prior movie shots so viewers don't have to think too hard, and try to surprise us with a terrible plot. Go in with zero expectations and you may feel that it rates above zero out of 10 - but barely.The only favor Warner Brothers does is ensure it isn't restricted to theaters.",1
670,"Where to start? It's 2021 and the visual effects don't even hold a candle to the first 3. If your going to keep with a series, you gotta hold some of the guts. I love this series. But I literally just watched the movie and can't remember any of it. Well. The falling bodies scene was cool but that's about as original as this film gets. Story line sucked. Visually could not stay interested. It's John Wick 9 basically. Sad and forced. Zero originality. Total cash grab for everyone. And a huge fail for the new watchowki sister now I guess. Which sucks because I got mad respect for the roots of this flick!",3
671,"Lana Wachowski clearly had an impact on this movie, and this time she moves to far..Sad for fans of good films, because this movie stinks and is bad..I would ratehr watch Ghostbusters 2015 than this!Bad movie and not worth watching...rent it in a few years if you want to see it.",3
672,"This movie has received its share of criticism, most totally unfair. Writer-director Lana Wachowski explains the movie this way - if each of the first three Matrix movies are represented by adjacent rectangles then this 4th movie is a large rectangle that encompasses all the others.Some of the story is self-referential, in the matrix we witness a discussion of ""Warner Brothers studio wanting a 4th Matrix movie."" We encounter a Thomas Anderson as a famous designer of computer games, namely the first three Matrix movies, but in a mirror reflection we see it isn't Neo (Reeves).We do know from the prior movie that both Neo and Trinity died so they had to create a story element where they were somehow recreated - ""resurrections"" if you will.Getting past all that, much of the movie features short flashbacks of scene snippets from the earlier movies. It relies heavily on old familiar fighting techniques, including bullet time sequences. Plus car and motorcycle chases that are very similar to old ones, and helicopters crashing into tall buildings.As several of the actors explain on the ""extras"" the main theme of the movie is love, and the reuniting of Neo and Trinity is a manifestation of that. My wife and I enjoyed it, I don't rate it as highly as the original, ground-breaking Matrix movie, but in its own right is a very well made and entertaining movie. Probably a ""7 of 10"" quality movie.At home on BluRay from our public library, picture and sound are first-rate.",
673,"I love Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, but this latest installment of the Matrix is a disappointment. First half of the film dragged on as I looked at my watch thee times and checked my phone twice. There were several cringing moments and quite a few predictable ones. The film felt like it was gasping for fresh ideas all the while going in circles ""force-minding"" (force reminding) the audience how great the first three Matrixes were. Action started picking up in the later half, but it also felt like the artist / director was retracing the previous drawings. What made the original Matrix great was because it gave audiences new metaphysical concepts and the ""a-ha"" moments we've all been yearning for in 1999. Technology and scientific breakthroughs have obviously advanced since, Matrix Resurrections decided to stay stuck and behind. I didn't drink any alcohol or take any of the red or blue pills, but still felt like I got a mild hangover coming out of the theater.2022 New Year Update: I can tell already most of the positive reviews are by its cast and crew 😂",1
674,"Mind-boggling in more ways than one, The Matrix Resurrections can at times be a joyful return encapsulating on the charm of the original- but at other times- be quite a joyless and convoluted reboot too much in the vein of its incredibly overdone sequels. I'll be honest and say prior to this film I have only seen the original Matrix and parts of the sequels following it- but I know enough and have seen enough to dislike the sequels and feel they are honestly a strain on the original's legacy. It's sad to say that for the majority of this film, it isn't any exception. It has cool visuals and cinematography, but it lacks the heart and magic that made the original so amazing- and what's even more cruel is that with a little bit more effort- this film could have had it. The first 35-50 minutes of this film were honestly incredibly well done. It does a brilliant job at putting you in the headspace of the characters and transporting you into a new sort of matrix that is as meta as can be. It has a lot of cheap references to the originals, but it feels incredibly genuine in tone and execution and allows for a truly out of box experience that even challenges some of the concepts of the original. After its breathtaking beginning though it goes steadily downhill, relying on various convoluted plot points from the films sequel, setting up needlessly tedious things to explain how the future has gone, and an incredibly bland and confusing backstory and setup to continue the rest of the film. It's easily the biggest switcheroo a movie has pulled on me in a long time and i'm frustrated at the potential lengths this film could have gone with its often stunning beginning and instead settling for mediocre and convoluted storytelling. Keanu Reeves is fun throughout and Carrie-Anne Moss provides a delightful return. Jessica Henwick is honestly the only decent actor among the new cast members and other returning ones throughout, fitting the role at hand and feeling like the only consistent performance throughout the films run. The rest of the films casting choices is a bizarre mix of odd and miscast, most notably Neil Patrick Harris- who started out fine in the film but then soon rose to lengths he just simply wasn't able to fulfill- and Jonathan Groff as the returning Agent Smith who is just dreadfully miscast and a missed opportunity in general. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was also a disappointment throughout, occasionally filling the shoes of Lawrence Fishburne with some charm, but mostly yet another disappointing miscast- which was sad considering my affection for him in many acting roles lately. In the end, The Matrix Resurrections could have been something extraordinary and for a minute it kinda was. Its breathtaking beginning encapsulates many of the things I love about the original, but its eventual descent into mediocrity and convoluted storytelling make it as forgettable and frustrating as this film could have gone and for that i'm sad this film couldn't have seen a better fate.My Rating: 5/10.",5
675,"First, this movie will not make any sense to you if you haven't watch the trilogy.Second, this movie will not make any sense if you watched either one or two of the trilogy.Third, if you watched the trilogy, or one or two of them, you'll be dissapointed in epic propotion.It is not a Matrix sequel. It is a Matrix parody.Hard to not laughing.Directing of photography, direction, music, editing, and the atmosphere is so different than the trilogy.Sloppy in every level.Why could they do that?How did they end up in this sensless circus?Avoid it.",4
676,I would give it 3 stars only because of Keanu otherwise the movie was bad. Truly bad. I don't believe this movie can be a part of the initial trilogy. There isn't any place to compare at all....seems with time we lose good movies which is sad.,3
677,Complete rubbish. Static acting. Plotholes galore. Hard to follow at times. Ending was contrived. Alternative characters grab-bag. Energy of movie lacking. Please don't make another sequel.,4
678,THE QUESTION IS WHY A GARBAGE LIKE THIS CAME OUT? THE PLOT IS FOR KINDERGARDEN AND THE FIGHTING SCENES ARE LESS IMPRESSIVE THAN THEY WERE 20 YEARS AGO.,1
679,"It starts slow, repeats everything the first one had already explained. Then it gets slower. They reuse so much material from the first one, including lines and actual video.The dialogue is stale, boring, they talk for 5 minutes then theres a change of scene, with another character yapping nonsense for other 5 minutes. Change of scene, looks like the action is coming, nope, another character talking for 5 minutes. RINSE REPEAT FOR 2 hours.Then it LITERALLY gets slowest. It's amazing how they abused innecessary slo-mo (think Snyder cut).",4
680,"Wow! Unwatchable. Just set 150 Million on fire and give me back these 2.5 hrs please. Jesus wept, what a waste. Self indulgent nonsense. At least one of the sister/brothers had the good sense to bow out of this train wreck. Fingers crossed that K. R. saved his good stuff for the next Wick installment!",1
681,"Absolute disgrace. Bad story, bad casting, bad lighting, bad effects, bad script, bad editing, bad colour grading, bad choreography, bad camera work and just down right disappointing.Just wasted over 2 hours of my life and I want them back. Don't waste your time.",1
682,"First of all, I think Reeves is a horrible actor, a la Bill and Ted where he didn't even try but it worked because it was a farce. Matrix 1 worked because the story was so eye opening and new, and the special effects combined with an excellent Morpheus character saved it from Reeves' terrible acting. Reeves is like Melanie Griffith. He is always the same character, same face, same reactions, same everything in every movie. He's better in Sponge Bob Square Pants latest than this one. So, with Morpheus replaced, and the story completely destroyed by raging left wing politics, we have a wokefest starring the great NPH, a comedian, and Reeves, a one dimensional nothing that got lucky in Matrix 1. Matrix 2 and 3 destroyed the first one. This strange number 4 movie in a fourlogy (?) is so out of place and so further destructive of the entire story that I reccomend you skip it except for the first scene, then leave. Hollywood is making propaganda not entertainment. As a good alternative, please see Spiderman No Way Home, a movie that is not political, an excellent heartwarming and heartbreaking story and that ties a huge and glorious bow on all the Spiderman movies so we'll done that it gives me chill bumps just thinking about it now as I write. Woke and bad movies like Matrix Ressurections NEED to fail. A message must be sent loud and clear: Entertain us. Unify us. Make us ALL smile and be impressed. If not, we have no need for you Hollywood and we'll let China and Netflix completely and wholly replace you.",1
683,"...cause I so badly wanted to revive the first matrix hype. And I had high expectations...that were not met. I didn't understand much of that movie, why they were back in the matrix, why part of the movie had the same storyline of the first movie. Where does this architect came from cause I don't remember seeing him in previous matrix. Too bad matrix 2.021 won't make history...",5
684,"It seems somebody thought the notion of how long it's been could be translated to fond memories, and that was sufficient material for a movie.The film is painfully low budget, the plot fails to enact the wonder of a world beyond this one, not even the sense of Alice in Wonderland.It's actual clips from the previous films, like watching gramma's vacation footage, complete with ""oh I remember this bit, that's where we...""Entertainment this is not.",1
685,"As an old Matrix fan, I'm ashamed to have watched this absolute garbage - definitely the history's worst movie ever made and looks like a documentary more than a movie anyway.0 writing0 directingDon't even waste your precious time thinking about watching this waste of data. Rather watch the TV's noises.",1
686,"Ok, let me start saying this is not an all bad movie, but it doesn't feel any like the previous Matrix franchise. Not the acting, not the script, not the enviroment, nothing seems really in the right spot. And one of the bigger problems, if not the biggest, Keanu is not Neo anymore, there is zero percent chance you see him and not relate him to John Wick.",6
687,"20 minutes in and I was completely bored out of my skull. First Matrix was absolutely great, from there it just went downhill to this number 4, that hits rock bottom.",1
688,"I don't even need to explain. You'll fully understand after watching; all of it. I can't even..... I fully understand the matrix and still.... yikes. Even agent smith could have had the same mannerisms as his old self to connect the movies and to neo, but damn, total disconnect. Swing and a huge missed opportunity to satisfy fanfare.",5
689,"LIKE THE LAST HALF (more like 3/4... HONESTLY).... That was extremely hard watching the series being further butchered! I loved the 1st film.. I liked the 2nd and a few pieces of 3.. this is closest to 3.. kinda just unnecessary and dragging out for WAY too long. This movie is contradicting at every turn and nonsensical.. but there are a few good parts and characters... unfortunately, it's too stupid and time wasting to anyone other than maybe the hardest of fans... I think it says something huge that only 1 wachtaco would return. Along with no Fishbone or weaving! They ete smart enough to say no and really distance themselves! Because this 1 makes NO SENSE! Just shooting and flashy flamboyant clothes and colors CONSTANTLY! LITERALLY HALF THE FILM!",5
690,"Once again, we see why older franchises need to be left alone, most of the time. ""Revolutions"" and ""Reloaded"" didn't have the magic of the original. Yet they were watchable. They rounded out a trilogy which should have ended there.This installment lacked nearly all qualities which made the Matrix a fascinating film. Oh, sure, they took some stabs at the themes... but stabs don't necessarily mean inspired execution. The story, the ""feel,"" the world-building, the acting - all were sub-par. Was Keanu just not invested in it? Or was this version neutering him? I didn't see him as ""The One,"" either coming to be, at the top of his game, or making a comeback.The world just didn't make sense, for too many reasons I won't get into here. It coasted on the inertia of its predecessors, but offered little to nothing new of its own.The music and directing didn't thrill me.Truly tragic are that they didn't even manage to bring back Weaving. (And Smith's role in this installment didn't even add up). Or Fishburne.I guess the only things which were decent quality were the effects. But even they were hardly the revolutionary spectacle of the original. They were run of the mill for today's motion picture. I'd take a Marvel film any day for those.OK - and a few scenes in the first half hour, where the film poked fun at itself. And the post-credits scene was worth a laugh. Sad when the sidebar humor is better than the main part of the movie...My score is marked down for the lack of what it could have, and should have been. But it only gets the score it does, for being a decent FX film of the day. Story-wise, I'd give it a 2.All in all, I'd say this was a pretty obvious cash grab by the studio. As a far of the originals, I'm glad I saw it for curiosity. But I wouldn't have been missing anything if I skipped it.",3
691,"No clear direction, no action, no new special effects, just a bad way to almost tarnish the matrix movies, almost walked out mid movie, almost feel sorry for Keanu.",1
692,"Resurrections is as subtle a ploy as digging up grandma and zapping her with a defibrillator. Fruitless, pointless and incredibly distasteful. Neo sums it up in Resurrections when he says words to the effect of everything he ever did previously meant nothing. And that's exactly what this movie does. It cheapens everything that has gone before and insults the fan base for the sake of making some money.Let me qualify this by saying I am old enough to have watched the three previous movies in the cinema! I don't share the hatred some have for Reloaded and Revelations - I quite enjoyed them. But like or loathe, the first three movies tied up the story and left it pretty much as a done deal.",4
693,"This was such an incredibly bad movie. Biggest mistake was Yabba Dabba Doo with his Barney Rubble performance that somehow was supposed to replace Laurence Fishburne. His acting skill in this film was on par with a 1980's sitcom. Carrie Anne Moss, Keanu Reeves and Jessica Henwick gave great performances. But you can't fix a pathetically bad script. I know you'll convince yourselves it's really not that bad. It is. So don't say I didn't warn you. Keep your money in your pocket.",2
694,"Yet again, as a female, I'm offended by the blatant wokification of female characters. The original saga already had empowering minority characters yet they somehow had to blatantly change existing characters in their poor attempt at money grabbing.The original film was to thought provoke, yet this film reverted to the most basic cinema theme of love is eternal. I never once pondered over any comment made in this film.The nostalgic element was also lazy. They literally just projected old scenes from the original saga. It was insulting to think people would be satisfied with this. Use new characters, actually develop a plot to guide, and stop blatantly writing characters for ""in your face"" displays of empowerment instead of writing empowered characters from the start.",2
695,"This movie is reminding me somewhat about SW Episode 7 where everything is made just to play on nostalgic feelings of fans and fans only, people who aren't familiar with Matrix or didn't watch at least one of the original movies won't be able to comprehend the plot that is quite poor in this one. Machines allied with humans, why? Machines saved Neo and Trinity, what's the point? Matrix ended at part 3 and that's it. Any kind if continuation won't fit the story whatsoever unless it is a new story with new characters. The 4th part doesn't have that atmosphere of seriousness from original trilogy. Wasted two hours of my time.",2
696,"My The Matrix Resurrections SPOILER Review:PROS:Keanu is always a win!CONS:Everything Else!What the F@CK was that?! The first Matrix is one of my all-time favorite films! I even enjoy the sequels to an extent. This film felt like it was MOCKING the original trilogy on every level by having one the most annoyingly meta scripts ever put to screen. This is The Force Awakens in the worst way. It nullifies the ending of the 3rd film and the sacrifices the characters made. The peace Neo made between man and machine was over in a heartbeat, Smith is somehow still alive and NOT played by Hugo Weaving (which is simply wrong), the machines were somehow able to bring Trinity back to life, humans are still being enslaved by the machines and blah blah blah. Basically, you could write a book on the plot holes of this film. It's terribly bad. The new Morpheus felt like a joke and an insult to the gravitas brought the character by Laurence Fishburne. Trinity now somehow has the powers of The One? Which just doesn't make any sense, one of the great things about her character was that she was a BADA$$ without needing the powers of The One. It feels like another example of modern-day Hollywood's 'politics. They can't have a male superhero with a female character who is stronger than him. That scene where Trinity can fly while Neo somehow can't made my want to vomit. The acting was terrible across the board, NPH feels like a bad version of his HIMYM character. All the new characters forgettable, I could not tell you any of their names. The Action is TERRIBLE. The original revolutionized action films. The action here is just boring and bland. The fights were laughable and an insult to the original. The visual effects were bad within the world of the matrix. The continuous flashbacks to the original trilogy just reminded of better films than the one I am watching. This is one of the most unnecessary movies I have ever watched. I have nothing good to say about this film and I wish I could get my time back. 2/10.",2
697,"The plot is a mess, it doesn't make sense and this franchise shouldn't have been resurrected.The dystopian polarized world we live in these days offered so many angles to explore a story of mind control, but they completely missed the trick.

698,"1. The acting is terrible, the only good act was the black cat.2. Fight scenes are really slow and predictable. Even my 2 year old is faster.3. The whole story is not about Neo....? Change of style?4. Fly away ending without solving any issues?5. Worst movie of 2021, i can assure you that.",1
699,"Really disappointed at how there was zero Matrix atmosphere or ideas in this movie. The fights were just regular Hollywood fight scenes, without the finesse we remember from the original trilogy, the plot started off promising, but quickly became boring action drivel. Towards the end it got a bit ridiculous either.It would be tolerable as a standalone action movie, but it's definitely not a Matrix movie, despite the fine performance delivered by Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss.",4
700,I don't know about anyone else but this is a waste of resources. I'm thinking that Reeves did this movie out of loyalty to the Wachowski brothers whereas Moss did the movie for the $$$. I saw this on HBO MAX and I am so glad I didn't waste my money at the movie theater. IMHO...wait for it on TV.,3

It looked so cheap, did not like colors, choreography of action scenes was horrible.",1
703,Notes of hot trash. Plot is garbage. Should have left it dead at trilogy. There was no need to bring this back from original perfection. Even Keanu could not save this.,1
704,"This movie is pointless. The only reason this was made is so that Warner can keep ownership over the IP. At the end of this movie, we are exactly where we were at the end of the last trilogy.And it's a real shame, because I feel like they missed an opportunity to actually tell an interesting story here. With today's cellphone use and social media, and how we are already plugged into a matrix of our own doing, it would have been an interesting dynamic to explore. They had the chance to actual make some social commentary. It would have added extra layers to an already layered story.Instead. This feels very corporate. It feels like a product imagined at a board-meeting. And sadly, it lacks all of the soul that the original franchise had.",3
705,"I'm so angry at this movie and Lana Watchowski for making it. There are so meany things wrong with this money, it feels cheap, like almost meaning less and just pure pop. The first movie has purpose, a clear purpose, to save humanity, the last remaining city, etc. But here, there's no urgency, there's no higher purpose, just a love a story that doesn't seem to need to exist, the whole arc feels purposeless. The supporting characters feel so fake, so out of place, the dialogue is full of slang pop culture language that doesn't make sense, it almost feels like a teenager wrote this. Neo feels truly stupid and clumsy instead of powerful and purposeful. I could really go on... worst matrix movie every, such a missed opportunity.",3
706,"Whomever claims they understand the nonsensical plot of this movie is just plain lying. It was a struggle making it through the ending of this one. Just such pure BS.

Too many attempts at cheesy/corny moments and lines, they didn't have the same approach with the greenish lighting to the cinematography, and characters from previous movies were pretty much dragged through the mud with the new take. Only saving grace was the beginning plot and the here and there moments where they held the attention.",4
709,"It has some interesting concepts but feels kinda rushed and unfinished, I don't really recommend watching it in cinemas, since it isn't the best but you can certainly watch it if you want to know what happens next in the Matrix franchise.",6
710,"As a huge fan of the original Matrix directed by the Wachowski ""Brothers"", when I heard this sequel was coming out I actually cringed. Lana, now one of the Wachowski ""Sisters"", has really attempted to pretty much remake the original Matrix movie, and shove all the woke crap she can think of in there. Gone is the green tinge that gave Matrix it's unique flair. Everything is blue hair and colourful. The movie is also extremely boring. Just let the franchise die already, forget this movie was ever made.",1
711,Just overall bad movie. Something that tried to piggy back on original iconic film. Weak story and lack of excitement. Boring two hours of nothing. Happy to see trinity back but realistically I can't be the only one to wish that after first matrix movie it should never be another one.,1

I waited for a strong, structured, sophisticated, thrilling, exciting &amp; special picture.The plot is weak, vulnerable, the casting, story &amp; overall structure of the movie is shallow.

This is not the matrix, this is a shallow film that had no elements to succeed and was forced into us.",1

716,"A giant miss for story telling, no real forward thinking with visual effects, and for some reason this film intentionally mispronounces the word ""model.""As far as story telling this movie is a scene by scene near carbon copy of the original film (and in case you never saw the first one or have forgotten any of it, don't worry, scenes from the original are injected into their contemporary counterparts.)No new threat. A giant miss on retelling a love story (which the entire plot revolves around.) Action scenes are weak. Visual effects are lazy and uninspired. But it is watchable... long but watchable.Why/How is it watchable with all that? Well, if you actually remember the second and third film... let's be honest, they weren't great either. So it's a viable revisioned reboot of a dead franchise. It's a good starting point. But there is that one thing I can't get past: why the hell are they mispronouncing a word we all knoe how to say? Like the blatantly mispronounced ""Zion"" of the original trilogy ""model"" is the country in this film that will be rejected by fans as well as anyone being introduced to The Matrix in 2021.Reminds me of Marvel's ""symbiote"" ordeal. Who are these actors, writers, directors, etc., who don't know how to pronounce words, and why isn't anyone correcting them?",1
717,"It's hard to understand if this ""movie"" is meant to be taken seriously or not.Everything about it is terrible.The special effects are terrible.Barney Stinson acts exactly like Barney Stinson, at one point it reminded me of ""the playbook"" episode from HIMYM.The original Matrix is my favorite movie. It should have been the only one made.",1
718,"I could not watch this edition of The Matrix more than 30 minutes. It's an absolute mockery of the the original franchise and the only reason I gave 3 starts is because of the quality of the filming/effects.Long story short, there is no continuation/explanation what happened in Revolutions (Trinity died, Neo got blinded...etc), the story has no essence or relation of the original franchise, the actors are just not fit for their roles, the script contains lines where they talk about ""the matrix, marketing, warner bros"" and so on; how could that even be included in The Matrix?What makes this even worse is that they tried to replace Morpheus with this new character that ""emerged"" from an agent?!... tried to replace Trinity... the ""bunny rabbit"" tattooed girl... and so on.And last but not least... why does Neo look like John Wick!?Really disappointed, this should have never been made. Compared to what they created 20 years ago in terms of storyline, effects, actors... this is mockery.This is never, ever, going to ""reload"" the original franchise.",3
719,"I cannot stress how much I did not enjoy this film.So many things wrong with it from story to direction. Of all the things I disliked, the flashbacks of previous films was at the top of the list.I didn't understand the need to recast Laurence Fishburne's character, especially considering the new actor was not great.The story overall was just not satisfying. The brief nostalgia is quickly lost after the first act. I think some films are worth revisiting; however, I wish Lana Wachowski/Wachowski brothers left this trilogy for what it was.",4
720,"I had high hopes for this film as the original trilogy was so full of new ideas and magic. This did not live up to the original films and played out more like a B Movie. The dialog was expository, the acting was terrible and the story sucked. Don't waste your time with this flop of a movie, I lost 2.5hrs of my life that I can't get back while watching this piece of trash.",2
721,"I was very cautious with the hype when the trailer dropped and set the bar and expectations for this movie low. Yet it still was a disappointment.This is just simply not a good movie. If it didn't have the Matrix franchise attached to it, it would've been a straight-to-DVD sci-fi. I simply couldn't get the Matrix atmosphere from any of the scene or visuals. There was absolutely nothing original or unique about the story or any of the scenes.The original Matrix also had a tinted green world visual, at least they could've tried it here too, but they didn't. Just felt so disconnected from the entire Matrix universe. Couldn't care about any of the characters. No wonder that the original cast was not interested in this.Bad pacing, and unnecessarily long.If you have HBO Max, watch it, don't pay for it at the movies, not worth the ticket priceI hope that this was the last installment of the Matrix franchise, they managed to ruin it even worse after the second and third installment in the early 2000's.",4
722,"The plot while it makes sense is very rushed. Action scenes dont really stand out by themselves except for a few moments. Cinematography is top notch. Stunts are top tier.I cant in good conscience rate it higher than 4. The only reason i dont just give it a 1 is because of Keanu. He and Anne is the only glimmer of hope in this mess.Matrix 1 easily 11/10, 2 and 3 in my own opinion we're 9 and 8 but still 10/10 just because. This is below 5. I wanted to give it 5 but all it has going for it is nostalgia. Seeing beloved characters was just a bait. The script needed more a lot more work or extended into 2 parts. Compared to even fan made ones or old drafts (that may have been fan made as well) its worse than amateur writing.Go see something else but then there isnt much else playing in cinemas at the moment. Except maybe for marvel stuff.",4
723,"I had never walked out of a movie before seeing The Matrix 4.I love the Matrix franchise dearly - ""Resurrections"" is the equivalent of chewing glass and trying to convince yourself it tastes like pizza.Staring at a cardboard cutout of Keanu Reeves would be more entertaining than this incomprehensible, complete disaster of a movie.The writing is utterly confused, the story and pacing are of the caliber of a six year-old's imagination.The characters are so flat you want to shoot yourself.The Matrix Resurrections is a tragic parody of itself. Save yourself the pain and watch something else.",2
724,"This should never have been made. It is pointless, boring and they made a mess that ends up ruining the franchise. I'll try to pretend This never happened. There goes 2hrs of my life that I won't get back.I can't believe Keanu signed up for this.",1
725,"I watched this with my expectations super low, yet it was STILL THAT bad... If you value your time, do NOT watch this film... there is NO worthy scenes at ALL.It was literally like watching a low budget SNL comedy skit.The cinematography, actions, casting, acting, script... everything was GOD awful.Honestly, they even had the audacity to mention Warner Bros. In the film; they really like to promote themselves that badly like they did with Space Jam 2; I swear they can only think of video games??The action scenes in this movie drags on so much and is so generic/boring to watch with its closeup green screen shots. The original Matrix, even to this day, the action holds up as something unique and cool to watch.While nobody expected this to be a masterpiece like on the level of the original, this is absolute garbage cash grab.I don't know if it was all due to the hormonal changes or what with the directors, but the original had style and badass scenes, but Resurrections is just plain cheesy generic trash.",1

I will give you 10 dollars instead of watching this abomination .What was your thinking?Did everyone came along for a quick payday?

Frankly this is a low grade love movie.It starts off as good, i had real high hopes for this movie, but soon after the first act yhings get worse every minute.",2
728,"Well, most of the reviews were right about The Matrix Resurrections. Waste of time, convoluted plot with mostly drama and not enough action plus nothing new in the CGI front just a retread of the 97 version and the whole love story between neo and trinity felt forced and 2 1/2 hours? That movie did not need to be that long. Plot and characters were dull just a big letdown.",5

It just kept going down the path of doldrums, repeats and excessive CGI.I personally thought the acting was abysmal as well. Absolutely no maturity. No depth.I still love the matrix 1 though and the 2nd and 3rd were decent in my opinion. But this? Garbage. Pure garbage. Such a shame. This movie should never have been made. It's the epitome of touching a complete work for the hell of doing it, not because one wants to top their previous work.",1
734,"The only thing more terrifying than seeing ""Matrix 4"" is the very real possibility of there being a ""Matrix 5"" at some point in the future, something I am definitively not looking forward to after having to sit through the 4th movie.This movie feels hollow, shallow and unnecessarily drawn out. The action sequences are completely spoiled by the rapid cuts and close-ups of characters faces, which feels like a kick in the teeth considering what ""Matrix"" did with arguably much more limited technology at the beginning of the century.I wouldn't be this harsh with my rating, but the director has some big boots to fill when picking up such an iconic franchise. I believe there to be a lack of comprehension in what made the original ""Matrix"" as great as it still is to this day.",2
735,"Horrible fight scenes. Terrible acting (old lady Niobe was a disaster), friendly Pokémon robots, discount Morpheus, secondary and tertiary characters that never mattered making returns, terrible VFX (the bike shop where evil Neil Patrick Harris used bullet time against Neo)And...actual reference to ""bullet time""?!Holy. Crap. This was terrible.",3
736,I think Warner Bros and the director ruined this film. Not even related to the trilogy. Doesn't even feel or look like the same story. I'm 40 minutes in and about to turn it off. All I feel is annoyance and it's giving me a headache. It's really not good.,1

738,"A question raised by the first film with some novelty. This film, rather than being labeled a resurrection, more aptly should have borne the subtitle RIP. We all would have been better off for it by leaving things the way they were twenty years ago. Times have changed and we've moved on. Regarding reality, this was a nostalgia piece simply and cynically made to make money. The story is relatively incoherent and uninteresting. Whatever might have been interesting was frittered away, such as the gaming aspect or the psychoanalysis tangent. It was not engaging and had no new or fresh ideas.",2
739,"I was forcing myself to watch this until the end,I couldn't believe the same director who wrote the first one wrote this.Maybe her sister wrote the first one, because it seems that 12 years old wrote this trash,even the action is meh, they have ruined the series for me..",1
740,"It is so bad your eyes will bleed.As much as I like the main actors, they were not enough to make a good movie.The new cast has as much charisma as a courgette, every scene was painful to watch.

Remake The Matrix for a younger generation?I originally rated this 6, right after the theater, then 5, then after talking about it with others, I'm at 4, hopefully it won't keep going down... I better forget I watched it.This is just nostalgia for the first one, BTW, the fight scene in the train? What a wreck! You cannot find a more edited fight scene, there probably are out there, but man! Nothing is clear, everything good about Matrix fights is lost here.",4
742,"I get why people are dumping on this, it's not the sequel they where hoping it would be, but despite it's flaws and there are many, I really did enjoy this movie. To The people that hated this movie, I respect your opinion, I'm not trying to change your mind, but your not gonna change mine.Thomas Anderson(Keanu Reeves) a video game designer, start remembering events( from the other movies) he's not sure if it's real or just a dream. But soon a decision will have to be made about a blue pill and a red pill?Keanu Reeves and Carrie - Anne Moss have such great chemistry, weather there in a action scenes or just sitting at a table talking, you just enjoy seeing them together. Fight scenes are pretty good, although not quite as awesome like in the previous films. Other actors are pretty good also like Yahya Abdul - Mateen, Jessica Henwick, Neil Patrick Harris, and Jonathan Groff. Effects are pretty awesome also.It's not perfect, but I still had fun here, in some ways it's different from the others. I don't know if there is gonna be any more, but I enjoyed this for what's it's worth.",9

They are as stupid as everyone who decided to get together and make this film.The original Matrix remains one of my favourite ever movies, if not my all time time favourite. It changed movies for me and, to this day, is the only film I have watched for the first time, and them watched a second immediately after. I was immediately hooked on (or in) this world. There will be no second rerun of Resurrections for me. In fact, I am annoyed there was even a first.",2

745,"As so many of the reviewers I (still) am a huge fan of the original film The Matrix. The sequels then took a different direction, which I hated but after having seen Resurrections, I gotta say Reloaded and Revolutions were masterpieces.This movie simply sucks at all levels and with a heavy heart I gotta say, this is the worst movie this year.I like Keanue and Carrie-Anne so much and seeing them in such a disaster of a movie makes me feel very bad for them.But despite everything: The biggest loser in all this tragedy is Warner Bros. A couple of idiots who have absolute no taste in nothing financed something terrible because their greed told them to do so. Well fine, this is the receipt for it.",4
746,"That was disappointing but not entirely unexpected. I like the original Matrix trilogy pretty evenly, finding its pretensions thin but the overall entertainment value of the hero's journey inverted fairly consistent. There was always room for the story to continue in some way, but when Lana Wachowski finally took up the offer to make the sequel, leaving Lilly who didn't want to be part of visiting their past, Lana did it out of a sense of loss for the pair's parents who died within a few months of each other. Deep emotion is an interesting place to begin the storytelling process, but it really needs to be molded with great care. The end result feels like a therapy session, filled with memories, deep emotion for the person telling the story that the one listening probably doesn't share, and all over the place at the same time.The Wachowskis have been telling the story of The Matrix for a while now, and they haven't limited themselves to just the films. Beginning with The Animatrix and Enter the Matrix, they've pushed the edges of storytelling in the world well beyond the cinematic incarnations, ending with The Matrix Online, an MMORPG that advanced the story well beyond the end of The Matrix Revolutions. I never played it, but I've read enough to know of some of the bigger events, and The Matrix Resurrections picks up the story from there. And a lot happened that the audiences need to catch up on, including the fact that Morpheus died and was...reborn as a program. This stuff is getting weird from the beginning. I'm largely okay with weird, but never trust a Wachowski to deliver weird information elegantly or all that interestingly. The opening of the film is the exact kind of mess of ideas that really dominates the film for about its first three-quarters until it becomes a purer action spectacle.Bugs (Jessica Henwick) is the captain of a ship that's hacking into a modal, looking for Neo (Keanu Reeves), and they find a recreation of the events that began the first Matrix movie, but things are different. Trinity doesn't get away, she gets pinned down by several agents and killed. Also, one of the agents is Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who saves Bugs and they have an information dump that's supposed to get us caught up. And then we get to Neo, who is living in the Matrix as a game developer who had made a trilogy of games called The Matrix, a ploy by the machines to keep Neo controlled without completely wiping him out because he somehow is the source code of the new version of the Matrix that was uploaded over the old version of the Matrix. The lore of this whole thing is a mess, and so little of it ends up feeling necessary.One of the major things going on early in the film is Lana's efforts to figure out what a sequel to the original trilogy actually is. So, there is literally a scene where Neo and his game design team sit around and talk about what people actually liked about the first Matrix ""game"" (i.e. Movie). It's self-referential at a level that feels like an idea in a first draft that would get discarded later. By having to have characters in the movie figure out what a sequel to the originals would be, we're getting a writer's room discussion in place of anything like drama, and none of it ends up mattering.Bugs and Morpheus manage to get Neo out after a failed attempt that turned into an action scene that got wiped out from Neo's memory by Neo's Analyst (Neil Patrick Harris). Bugs and Morpheus get Neo into a train in Japan, and the worldbuilding of the new version of the Matrix begins in earnest, and it's never either all that clear or, really, all that important. The operators being visible at times in the Matrix feels like an idea with no real thought behind it. The use of mirrors as portals instead of phones is neat. The inclusion of bots as enemies is also an interesting idea, but the movie ends up going far overboard with it to the point that you wonder if there are all that many real people in the Matrix.And then the movie's plot actually starts. At about the halfway point. This wouldn't bother me if what had come before had been interesting, but the Wachowskis have never been known for interesting characterization or elegant writing. Getting mired in lore and bad worldbuilding hobbles this film, and the film isn't even done with it. You see, Zion no longer exists, replaced by Io, a community of humans and machines that came together in the sixty years now being sort of ruled (maybe?) by Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) who is angry at Bugs for going in to get Neo against orders. More than halfway through this movie, we really didn't need a re-introduction to something like Zion, internal Io politics, and the actual introduction of the central point of the film: Neo and Trinity reuniting.Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) is alive in the Matrix despite her death at the end of the original trilogy, and, like Neo, she lives thinking that she's someone else. Neo wants to go back in and rescue her because he loves her, and he somehow convinces all of Io's ship captains to join him in a mission to help without even saying anything to them. Such is the power of the myth of the One, I suppose. They all meet with Sati (Priyanka Chopra Jonas), the little Indian girl program from Revolutions, who has already developed a plan to rescue Trinity because the Analyst (who is the new version of the Architect) had her father purged. All told in just straight up exposition because Wachowski.So sets up the action climax finale, complete with philosophical drivel about choice that's been on repeat since the first film with just enough variation to make it sound sort of interesting. I have to say that I was rather disappointed with the action in this film. It's not bad, but it ends up feeling pretty consistently flat after the opening sequence where Bugs and Morpheus meet and they use backdoors to go in and out of the action, flipping here and there. After that, it feels rather uninteresting and kind of bland. There's also a shockingly dearth of it as the movie really gets mired in all of this other stuff.And yet the point of it all is the reunion of Trinity and Neo. For all the worldbuilding, philosophizing, and lore, the point is this central relationship that was always stilted at best in the previous films, leading to me suppressing giggles at Trinity's death scene in Revolutions because it's so earnest and flat at the same time. That it takes so long to actually get to the film feels like the result of an unfocused writing process. And that's probably what it was. Lana has come out saying very explicitly that the movie was about the death of the Wachowski parents. It comes from a place of pain and sadness, and it seems like there was no other voice in the writing room trying to help mold the disparate ideas into something like a cohesive whole. There's also this assumption that the romance between Neo and Trinity was anything other than filler in between action beats in the previous films.No, this movie was not worth any wait. It's a jumble of ideas and emotions that never come together into a single vision, toying with the ideas of sequels, remakes, and reboots along with a host of other things important to only the most die hard of Matrix fans while treating the whole thing like a therapy session.",4
747,"Large portions of this films true magic have been completely overlooked or missed by those looking for a visual feast of special effects as the basis for their entertainment. They likely also failed to notice at least 5 appearances from Sense 8 Alumni; a particularly nice touch given the relationship values concurrent between the projects as well as the cast and creator.Did anyone else notice how the problem of choice was no longer just a human condition? This alone was a very intriguing evolutionary plot device aiding the return to the story some 20 years later (but only in our time reference - watch the reflections).The many levels of the complexity of consciousness were again freshly explored. Weaving this together is the more simplistic straining of the detente relationship between humans and AI we arrived at in the last movie.The ability to manipulate choice is very clever and requires one to recognize the messianic influence of a Neo character on any populace or culture. Hope has always influenced choice and the addition of treating the Neo Trinity relationship as an addition to the AI hope manipulation is both clever and uncomfortably close to reality.For anyone who doesn't understand what I'm talking about, please watch the film again, open your mind and remember, I can only show you the door.",10
748,"The only good thing I can say about it is the fact that the bots were cool. Otherwise, it was a dumpster fire of a movie. The movie tried to portray a ""woke"" feel, but it felt like being trapped in a room with ""hip"" grandparents. The lingo was so bad in the movie that it made me physically cringe. Mr. Reeves and Mrs. Moss are always a delight, but even they could not save this movie as the rest of the cast is dismal at best. The dialogue makes it feel like I am watching a B movie without the self-awareness of a subpar comedy. All I can say is that the movie feels like it should have won fourth place at a high school film festival, not be released in theaters as a continuation of one of the best movies of all time.",1
749,"This film was not for me, it is a sequel but I didnt like how much they reused old ideas and story elements, and made reusing stuff as part of the story, it got a bit better when they get out to the 'real world', some cool machine city imagery, but apart from that, it was so bland, new Morpheus actor was good but he felt like a pointless character, new agent Smith was a joke, absolutely no replacement for Hugo, a bit woke in some areas, very disappointed.",4
750,"I loved the original Trilogy, even when most people were panning the latter entry I got it and found it clever and to me it held a worthy place in the series. This new effort, well it's really rather dull, pointless and my overarching feeling is that this is some money grabbing exercise.The story makes little to no sense, it just feels like they cobbled together some drunken ideas and then went OK, let's add an over the top action sequence here, let's add some fan service there. Oh and to tie it all together we'll rehash some of the original movies with the people in that the fans and public actually care about.Throughout this version even the in jokes are rubbed straight in your face. Allegedly it's 60 years since the original trilogy, but somehow Niobe only looks about 70, even though she should probably be at least 85 if not in her 90s.Oh and now we have cutesy robots, sorry sentients, that had nothing similar in the originals, one can only assume they are to make merch and make more money. Oh and these being cutesy are obviously good, because you know, robots / AI has feelings and realises that humans = good and Matrix (who built and programmed them) = bad...obviously!Two of the best characters aren't in it, instead one is replaced by an over the top youthful Morpheus who is actually a new AI type of thing that is basically made up of millions of marbles, apparently held together by magnetism... Yep, OK... it felt like they got bored of the character half way through as they stopped him being human and resorted to marble form...Then there's the no longer Agent, Smith. Replaced by someone with the charisma of a dishcloth. Nothing about his character makes any sense, somehow he survived the purge (when the robots rebooted the old matrix and cleared everything down, except obvious flaws like this new Smith). It's probably best not to try and work out how he can just show up at you know, the most useful moments and save the day, because this is the new Matrix and nothing has to make any sort of sense.There's also some random exiles who show up just for one fight scene, that is really dull and silly. It's hinted at that they might do something else, but they don't.Story-wise... well half of the film wants you to think that Neo is a game designer and that the original trilogy was his game... the second half is a Romeo And Juliet style thing with a bit of a rescue story chucked in. It honestly is as bad as that reads! Make no mistake this is a trite mish-mash of ideas, just there to join daft sequences together.The original trilogy had moments where you weren't sure if the heroes would triumph, this one has none of that, it's one dimensional and so predictable that it's untrue. Who could possibly have guessed that super advanced AI needed Neo and Trinity alive to function, because, of course it does d'uh!The final action sequence is one of the biggest crimes against action sequences committed by any film ever. Suddenly thousands of baddies appear, because obviously Smith is now annoyed at Neo / Trinity and after saving them wants them killed... again, it's obvious really, LOL! However, our intrepid heroes and their tag along pointless comrades (just why are they even there or needed?) now have to fight through these hordes, hordes controlled by super advanced AI... the sort of super advanced AI that doesn't just tell them to block all the roads with a load of cars and wait for the heroes to falter...Obviously none of the tag alongs get killed, because when fighting hundreds of bad unarmed AI, you know you just have to wait and some more heavily armed tag alongs will rock up and save you, so that we can have hugging and stuff...Whilst the other thousands of bad AI just ignore you...Of course, we need the heroic couple to go up a sky scraper, I mean, where else would anyone being chased run? D'uh! Oh and then we need 3 helicopters to shoot at them and allow Neo to re-direct a missile into one of the others... Yet then the other 2 magically vanish whilst our dynamic duo lie down for a bit, waiting for the nice sunset to come. Honestly it's like this AI really doesn't want to hurt them.Then they all live happily ever after, like before, only in a more daft way this time...Normally with over the top action movies you can turn your brain off and just enjoy it, but this is really trying to be like the originals. It fails on all counts.Fishburne and Weaving did well to avoid being associated properly with this waste of time. Moss and Reeves really should have avoided it too, unless they needed to bump their bank accounts, because that is really the only reason this film could possibly exist.Even the visual effects aren't anywhere near as stunning this time around, as we've seen similar done in loads of films since the originals.",3
751,"I get the feeling this entire project is just a gigantic ""F U"" to the movie industry and life in general.They even explain it in the movie itself. If Lana hadn't excreted out this nonsense, then someone else would. But instead of making a great movie, She decided to make something that would get past the corporates and make it to screen, but would go down badly with fans.On that level, it is excellent. From 4th wall breaking exposition explaining what was going on, to endless cuts from the original trilogy juxtaposed with the new movies 'made for tv' framing, composition and emptiness, Lana really nailed the 'under duress' vibe.The plot is contrived nonsense, with childish blue/red lighting toy range components and a few chuckles at the movie's expense.The acting is earnest, although the 'aged' speech was excruciating for all the wrong reasons. I spent most of it just examining the prosthetic make up wondering why they didn't do it in post and make it less amateur.Bugs was fun, and the cast gave it their all, but...Is Lana harboring some internal grief from her transition? There is nothing uplifting or happy about the ending despite the rainbows and unicorns. It is something i've not seen discussed anywhere, but it should be. It hints at a ""monsters inc"" style resolution, but is more of a 'go back to sleep'.I think as tie goes by and people get over the sheer horror of the bad 'movie', then the less in your face themes may become something for discussion.",5
752,"I pride myself on being nuanced. I honestly believe everything has its weak and strong points. But not this abomination of a film.The story itself is unbelievably hollow, and they filled that void with shameless recycling of the Matrix trilogy and constant empty repetitive dialogues between forgettable characters. Everything else to the story was random, farfetched and confusing. It almost felt like a movie made by a youtuber with some Keanu Reeves cameos. They not only did injustice to the trilogy, the characters actually mocked it, openly, with the tons of sarcasm in referral to the first Matrix movies.Zero love and talent went into this. The most obvious cashgrab I haver ever seen - they have no shame. I still can't believe it. First review ever, just to fulminate and vent.Go watch it. Do it. See for yourself how low a director can stoop.",3
753,"I will keep this short. I am a The Matrix fan. This 4th installment did not deliver. And it seemed other folks at the theatre felt the same way. First time ever that I went to see a movie and the audience was cursing and booing when the closing credits appeared.Personally, this isn't only an awful Matrix movie but this is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Terrible story, mediocre directing, boring and long conversations (I honestly fell asleep for about 10 minutes), useless flashbacks to the old movies and characters you never care about. Even the action sequences were below average. It all felt cheap, rushed, lifeless and not at all original. Some parts, that weren't ment to be funny, made people in the theatre laugh (although I think it was out of misery)...It's so sad to say this... but if you love the original The Matrix, you will not like this one.",2
754,"First off, it saddens me to write a review as such because I am a huge fan of Keanu and the first Matrix movie. It is beyond its time and has revolutionized movie making in its genre afterwards.To say this movie was disappointing would be a huge understatement. While the movie peaks interest with opening flashbacks and Neo's life now as a game designer, the first 30 mins gradually told you that you're in for a very painful ride. I regret not walking out of the cinema because rest of the movie was absolutely mind blogging. My fellow audiences were about to fall asleep and by the time we got out, we left with some headaches.There was just too much going on, and by the end it became nothing but a forced love story nobody asked for. The casting was awful and a big disrespect to the original characters. It felt way longer than it was and nothing more than a waste of money, time and energy for those who made it and for those who are going to watch it. I really wish they never made this movie - just shocking!",1
755,I was hoping for something unique and exciting but got a reboot of a reboot with the energy of a day old tostada. I'm worried about the creativity of Hollywood right now very worried .,1
756,"The whole premise of this Matrix outing is flimsy, and having bits and pieces of the original cast doesn't help, especially for the iconic characters. The runtime is long so some parts drag. The overall plot ends up being muddled by the hoops the script jumps through to bridge the gap between the older films and this one, as if the story contorted to accommodate the logical problems raised by the casting decisions.",4
757,"Yet ANOTHER piece of Follywood woke crap. Making conservative views and opinions seem outdated and hack by comparing established norms to a Matrix of horrors. Yeah, we get it jerks. You want to destroy everything and raise it up in your image. Nah, ain't happenin'. You liberal, leftist imbeciles are already in the process of eating your own. That's a good thing. Keep pointing fingers, creating fake bad guys and telling us what to think. In the meantime we'll steal your ""intellectual"" property. Watch your movies for free. And reveal your so-called hidden agendas. Idiots. (Oh yeah, almost forgot, we'll take back both Houses in Novemeber and really do some damage!)",1

760,"Starters, movie has a serious dialogue boredom factor. For 30 mins you'll be tired in a literal sense. The flash backs are also constantly abused. We all saw the first 3. I don't need a flash backs. The characters that are resurrected do not act like their originals at all. A lot of your old favorites such as the wraiths that carried a unique look and added a great flavor are also missing. Would have like to see something new. Instead we got these choppy action scenes with no one special. This is also a major women empowerment movie. That's great I support it. However it's excessive to say the least. Neo is now the damsel in distress. The CGI has some small fun moments but doesn't bring much to the table here. I've already wasted enough life on this movie. I'd go on but, I'll sum it up. Don't waste your time or money on it.",4
761,It's getting SO tiresome...the last 4-5 years have been all about gender and race washing. No IP is safe from being changed and twisted. I can't understand why all these 'creatives' need to mess with original movies/shows instead of simply creating something new.Having said all this...the acting and plot in this movie would be enough for a low rating on their own.This...was terrible.,1
762,"Within the first 10 minutes of this movie, that including the producer and distributor company name, there's 3 ""I don't know"" moment and that's when I feared what have I gotten myself into: now there's a but coming. The horrifying moment of truth came when the new Morpheus didn't know he was Morpheus until he knew he was Morpheus out of the blue, and that's when I snapped. Twelve minutes and I was done. Why did Keanu Reeves and Carri AnnMoss agreed to this circus is eluding me still now! I have suffered irreparable head truma in those fateful 12 minutes.",1

I think ""Lana"" completely lost her mind thinking this is acceptable.Actually they should be ashamed of associating this with The Matrix trilogy.The atmosphere is more of a sitcom or SNL sketch rather than a movie, or something that you'd probably rather see from some crappy youtuber.I can't even express how far this is from the original Matrix and how dumb it is.Please, don't watch this. If you liked the Matrix, don't defile the memory of it with this complete, utter bs...",2
765,"The Matrix has never been my preferred franchise, but I've always enjoyed the philosophy and cool action. This movie tries so hard to replicate that, that it fails completely. The first 80 minutes is basically the worst and most expensive YouTube video essay about the Matrix. And the last bit is totally dull and convoluted. Easily the worst movie I've seen all year.",1
766,"It's really disappointing to see franchise fall this low.Actions scenes are uninspired, feel very generic and don't really carry any weight. Neo as ""the One"" is stripped from all abilities and he's basically running away from every fight the entire movie.There's so much exposition it's putting people to sleep. I nearly drifted off while listening to another explanation on what happened during past 20 years. Dialogs are boring. There are no stakes that get viewer invested in the story. It's like watching a documentary/commentary and not the David Attenborough kind.Only good thing about this so called movie was chemistry between Neo and Trinity. But it's only based on the history from previous movies. It wouldn't stand on its own. This said, you could feel the love and tension between those two. It was really enojable watching how they found each other once again.Overall, wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you need something playing in the background while you do the dishes.",4
767,"Awful direction plot &amp; script, Wachowski thanks for killing matrix.Story was all over the place. Neo became irrelevant since he was no longer the ""one"", trinity the new savior NO thx she was already a badass not need to push more stupid agendas with this film.The cast was awful and predictable. Also if you gonna set up a movie for more sequels at least stop being lazy with the 2h screens for the previous movies.Niobe make up my dear good ... just awful. More on screen time of how Zion turn into Io would have been great.Overall wasted time. I Prefer watching the original trilogy and erase this one of my mind.1 start for Neo and 1 for Trinity.",2

770,"First i am a huge fan of the Matrix Trilogy. Even though the second and third movie isnt well liked by most i loved it. I loved the action, i loved the story and i loved the atmosphere. The characters were serious and it focused on important topics and had a serious tone. There were things at stake.But this movie is really a slap to my face, a slap to the original movies.It is insultingly bad. I was shocked how terrible the story and dialogue is and the fighting was also mediocre at best. No way on a level as the original movies.I felt the passion in the movies before but here i only see greed and disrespect from one of the original creators. Imagine putting this garbage out and be satisified with it.It tried so hard to press on our nostalgia, the meta jokes and references or as i want to say blatant copies of the original to make us feel the emotions we felt before. It felt like an empty fan made movie who lost complete connection with the original.Either everyone gave too much credit to the originality and creativity and messages in the first movies and this movie just opened my eyes or wachowski doesnt care and destroyed her reputation for a quick buck.",3
771,"I saw matrix when I turned 18 and it was a movie like non other, thought provocative and the best scifi I had ever scene, so even though I knew this one was gonna be terrible I gave it a shot. That was a mistake. This movie ruins every single thing the first trilogy had created. No emotion no authenticity, nothing makes sense. Just a movie from money grabbing director and producers.",3
772,"The fight scenes look so bad compared with the 20 year old original. Terrible choreography, terrible cinematography, terrible editing.The worst thing about this movie is just how boring it is.",4
773,"Well except the producers who surely had dollar signs instead of eyes ... although why anyone thought it was a good idea to release this a week after Spider-Mans No way home is beyond me. That could never work ... not just because of the pandemic we are still fully experiencing.I understand people being dissapointed. We have romantic views of things of the past, even more so in times like these. No I'm not trying to put you in a bad mood. We are all in this together - no pun intended. Having an escape like the Matrix ... I reckon some would choose to go and take the blue pill(s). If they were offered to them.While I wrote reboot, you could also go revisit, reimagined, rewritten, remembered, rebranded and so forth .. maybe some of those will be used for a future entry in the Matrix saga (which can't be called a trilogy anymore ... not that logic has stopped anyone from doing things .. inside or outside the Matrix).Add to that recasted ... fans were not smitten when they heard that Laurence Fishburn was not ... reprising his role. Hey I don't remake these words up, they already exist - I am just reusing them. Ok I'll try to stop - maybe, let's just ... return to the movie.Now the role of Morpheus exists, but it seems someone else inhabits that role ... why? Well the movie is going to tell you why. There is a ""logical"" explanation for it. I put logical in "", because that same logic does not seem to apply for other character who are ... reprising their roles. Almost a shame it is not written with ""Ri"" ... a Rihanna obsessed friend of mine would get a kick out of that.That aside and logic kicked to the curb, the movie is quite openly mocking itself. As camp as you can get. Neo is being sought out ... for not apparent reason (that doesn't count into the words that start with ""re"", right?). But we don't need logic and explanations, when we get visual treats and fan service that should satisfy those watching. On a big screen if possible.Yes Keanu looks a bit like John Wick in this (which considering they shot the movies close together makes sense after all) - don't hate him for that. He may not be the best dramatic actor out there, but he has created or rather portrayed some really memorable characters on screen. We'll remember him for that ... that would be a good point to close the ... review actually.But on we go, because the action sequences are something to be talked about (really well made, even if Keanu uses a force now more often that not) and the fact that you have two villains who both are a great combination and help elevate the movie to a new level.Accept this for the campy trip it is supposed to be, be happy for the new generation that can enjoy a Matrix movie, and try to enjoy this romp with great visual effects. Also stay through the credits for a bonus scene - and if you like it or not, the Matrix probably will always return in one way or another ...",8
774,"This movie is painful to watch. It's not the actors or acting though. A big part of it is that it doesn't feel like a story, but also because it feels so constipated; it's just so forced. Another issue is that so much of the content is CGI, whereas the original was chock full of real actors doing live action sequences. Additionally, the cinematography is just plain bad; there isn't a continuous shot in the entire film lasting more than mere seconds. Finally, ""Resurrections"" just looks weird, which is likely attributed to all the CGI, as there are so few real settings and set pieces. Everything right down to the coloration just feels (or looks) strange, and not in a good way.Sure, maybe if you were born post-2000 and don't remember when the internet was new -- dial-up modems and desktop computers. Because of the original audience's familiarity with these things, the original film completely blew the minds of older Millennials and Gen-X. So if you're younger, I could understand why you'd enjoy this, and that's be fine if you do!However, for the folks who saw ""The Matrix"" in the summer of 1999 like I did -- and were totally enamored with and smitten by its cyberpunk charm and amazing story -- this new iteration likely just won't cut it for you. I don't take any pleasure in writing a scathing review of a franchise I like, but I can't lie. This movie, just like so many other new movies, is junk, and it's sad.",2
775,"Seriously, someone tell me what in the hot garbage this was? I cannot think of any better way to explain the eye diarrhea that I had to sit through. I've seen some bad movies, and then there is the Matrix 4, if this thing doesn't win Razzies for everything then there just isn't a movie God out there.Movie starts with Bugs looking at a Modal of the original Matrix... first off the very mention of using a Modal inside of a game is just ludicrous and programmers everywhere collectively facepalmed, because Modals are used within webpages, not fully indebt C++ code. Anyway Bugs, starts noticing weird things happening in this modal and realizes that it is nothing more than a simulation, used to train bot programs, aka AI.I should have cut the movie off at the mention of modal, but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. Skip forward to some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen in a film. You have the new Morpheus who turns out to be an AI as part of the modal simulation, starting to ""wake"" up to the fact that he is in a simulation... you know what? Screw this, I can't finish this review.Just realize the movie sucks, it is a cash grab that Lana obviously needed, there's a reason the other one decided not to come back and good on her for not coming back.This movie makes 2 and 3 look like A plus movies... and we all know they were hot garbage too... If you're a matrix fan stay as far away from this movie as possible, you have been warned.",1
776,"Seriously, even 2 &amp; 3 kept me engaged, a Matrix movie this dull is surely the final nail in the coffin of Wackoffski's career. This could have been a good movie if only they hadn't filled it with 2 hours of boring, droning, irrelevant talking, talking, talking. Why are supposedly 'action' movies filled with all the tedious 'feelings' rubbish? Because it's cheaper to film than actual action sequences. No wonder people are being harshly critical, you mess with what works and insert an agenda and people turn off.",4
777,"There are some good things about about it and some original ideas also some scenes are good. But as a whole, it just does not even make sense. There's so many plot holes and strange connections to the trilogy, and the look and feel of the movie is so amateurish it's just mind boggling. Specially the first 20min I felt like the wrong movie was on and this was just some fan made YouTube production. Especially Morpheus as a character went from cool to clown. And his whole backstory does not make any sense.",5
778,"I will start by saying that after seeing the movie I am quite surprised that Neo wasn't a woman or transgender maybe in this iteration, or maybe it actually is both considering the duality he and Trinity make and her becoming. This is the new norm and all movies must represent all genders and orientations in equal proportion (or more) so considering the previous ones had a male character, why not do it this time with some other gender.While appreciating diversity and rainbow flashy color costumes and gestures on otherwise characters that required seriousness such as Morpheus, this one is more like a soap opera or a parody to the original Matrix, possibly intended, since there is an explicit line in the movie saying that WB wanted the movie regardless it was made by the original directors or a new one. My feeling is that a better movie had come from a new director but now it is what it is.The only great thing about this movie is it's trailer which is impressive, but the actual movie it is not at all. It looks like the first Matrix was an accident of inspiration, latter ones being a downhill road from there.",3
779,"The whole movie started, ok. Not great, just ok. But then it felt like I was watching a bad marvel movie or F9 movie at times.It had stupid jokes, bad editing and the casting was bad.I love some of the actors on the movie but not for this role.It felt like a comedy action movie. The first ones were dramatic, dark, intense. This one was colorful, funny, and they tried so hard to tie it to the previous ones and exploit the nostalgia. Just pathetic.It's just a bad movie. Watch it, but with VERY LOW expectations. If you do that you might enjoy it.Oh men, warner, you should fire some people. Because they are just making the worst decisions, you are not marvel, and that is a good thing. Go back to making classics like the dark knight, or the original matrix.What a disappointment.",4
780,I cannot believe how bad this is. The original trilogy is one of my favorite ever. This felt like a parody. Action sequences were criminally bad. I'm talking B-movie Walmart bin bad. How can it be THIS bad when action sequences were so spectacular 22 years ago...I truly can't believe it.,1

782,"Yeah, this to me would probably rank third next to the third ""Matrix"" film, but I don't get the hate it gets. I agree that the first third is easily the best part. It has some great meta references where they make fun of themselves for the sequel. It was disappointing to not see Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving again. So, the story is that 60 years have passed and another Matrix has been created. This was caused by a war between the factions of the machines who didn't want to help the humans and those who did.It actually was interesting to see some good machines (or ""sentients"") even though it wasn't the best part of the film. I admit that in the first movie, Neo and Trinity's romance wasn't that well established. This gets a recommendation because it really does expand on that idea. Realistically, given how the Earth was still in ruins after the third movie, it makes sense the world would be like this now. Maybe I just associate with not knowing which pill to take. I'm still glad I saw it and I think the good outweighed the bad...but not by THAT much. ***",7

784,"The ""new"" Matrix movie is bad. So bad, it's enjoyable in some spots. Therefore, be warned... you may very well pee your pants from laughing so hard. Remember all of the copycat films that came out after the original trilogy? This is like a bad copycat *of the copycats.*The acting is shockingly bad - especially the horribly cast Morpheus - but there's something interesting in the fact that all of the actors deliver their lines in a deadly serious manner. Truly, they may as well be giving someone the news of a terminal diagnosis. It's kind of sweet how they're trying SO HARD. You get the impression that after each take, they slumped into a chair completely exhausted and had a juice box and some orange slices, like they just finished a pee-wee soccer game.This movie is to film what the fast food burrito stuffed long-haul trucker is to the truck stop toilet: it stinks, it's explosive in all the wrong ways, and it's kind of hilarious as long as you don't get too close.",1
785,"I went in to this movie with little expectations, as anything that has went straight to streaming simultaneously with theater release has been nothing more than a light fizzle.And even with low expectations, this movie left me with disappointment. As others have said, missing two of the biggest stars of the series reprising their roles, and having them be replaced by people who aren't even on the same level of acting really did a disservice to those said characters.The story was a complete mess, pacing made it feel like the movie dragged on forever, and the premise of being self-aware the matrix is supposed to be philosophical and mess with your mind tries to hard to fill that MO and fails miserably.",2
786,"This film is so boring and pointless, that this review risks sounding boring and pointless as well. Here is the film, spoilers galore (if you think this junk can be spoiled, that is):Neo and Trinity die. Then they are resurrected by some machines (hence the name of the film). One of the machines, called ""The Analyst"", proceeds to make a new Matrix and plugs them in. Somehow, in a way that was explained vaguely and badly, the new Matrix depends on Neo and Trinity to be near each other but apart for some stupid reason.So the first half is kind of intriguing: Neo is led to believe his memories are a fantasy and he made a game called ""the matrix"" (leading to a lot of meta references, but it sounds stupid), so he takes prescription pills to keep his ""hallucinations"" under control. He sees Trinity at a coffee shop and kind of likes her. And that's it. That's the interesting bit.On the outside we learn that 60 years have passed, and some people think Neo and Trinity are alive and are looking for them. Neo and Trinity can't be identified by those humans because the Matrix camouflages them. We also find out that Morpheus died, Zion fell and there was a machine civil war because some machines think matrix is necessary and some think they should let people go. The humans also made a new city called Io (it's a bad pun: 1 and 0, geddit?), that has both humans and machines living on it, and certain programmes can have physical bodies made by tiny balls of metal that can talk and feel and some other nonsense. The young Morpheus we see is such a programme.Talking about Morpheus.. (ugh, this is tiresome) the start of the film is confusing, but it kind of explains Morpheus. So, it looks like Neo made a matrix inside the matrix. It's implied because the character Bugs says there's some old code running. From Ne's perspective, he coded the game, but for some weird, unexplained reason, Bugs can access that as a classic matrix code (made by Neo's subconscious mind, maybe?) and finds out a programme that is equivalent to an classic matrix's agent. That programme looks like a young Morpheus and it has gone self-aware. And that's Morpheus in a nutshell.Oh, we also find out agent Smith is in the new matrix because ""reasons"" and he is a good guy now. And Trinity is ""the one"" in this new matrix.So a rogue crew (why is there a rogue crew? I don't know, no one does) finds Neo and gets him out. Then Neo kind of sticks around and mumbles about getting Trinity out. He doesn't do anything, he is just there, other people kind of take action instead. They rescue Trinity on a long and boring action sequence with some super-duper creative ideas like disconnecting a person without the red pill. The machines don't use cameras in the real world and security is overrated, it seems, so it's kind of easy to get Trinity out and their plan works like Macaulay Culkin fending off Joe Pesci on Christmas.Neo and Trinity have zero chemistry, and everything feels very fake, but Neo can stop bullets, making him more useful than a potato, and Trinity flies. Then Trinity gets all angry because of the whole business of being in the matrix again and kind of gets violent with the analyst, says some woke nonsense because the writer is a transgender (and they want us to remember that), Neo nodes in approval and then they both leave, nothing else happens and the viewer is left contemplating wtf was that.And that's it. A bland, predictable, mediocre film with some fan service, some scenes from the original injected in, some special effects, horrible dialogue, that awful young-people-know-better-old-people-are-silly kind of vibe around the character of Niobe, forgettable characters and some political correctness. All wrapped up in a flashy matrix box with the pretence of being a clever movie, but it's just a bore.I do not recommend. Just treasure the original, it's the best it gets.",1

The story was a dogs breakfast.This movie was the worst $20 I've ever spend on IMAX.Avoid wasting your money on this pile of brown stuff!

I think I am not even going to try and bother either... I think I'll just want to forget about this movie as fast as possible.... I will admit though, I did like the resurrection scene, where the machines were putting Neo back together.

796,"I really wanted to like this but it's so obvious what happened. The producers from Warner bros approached Lana and said, here's a briefcase full of cash to revive Matrix and turn into a money spinning franchise. Everyone had dollar symbols in their eyes and they set out to make a movie. There are plenty of nods to the previous Matrix films but unfortunately there just isn't enough here to warrant a return to Matrix. I was shocked at the lack of visual flair or creativity that we've come to expect from the Matrix films. When the film ended everyone just sat there wondering - What? This is it? This is the movie ?",5

They should have called it Matrix Regurgitated. That would have been truth in storytelling.,5

800,"Hard to fathom, after having had 20 years to think up an exciting new narrative for the next chapter, that the best they could come up with was a bunch of repeating scenes from Matrix 1.One of the many strong examples from Matrix 4 where they seemed to lose the plot is the scene with The Merovingian. In previous Matrix films he was cast as an entertaining character; an exquisitely dressed, wealthy and articulate French speaking man with gourmet taste and a beautiful wife and he was in one of the most beautifully choreographed fight scenes in the entire trilogy. But in Matrix 4 he comes back as a floating bagman and a villain with rotten teeth. This added nothing.On top of that, no amazing fight scenes, no great camera angles, lighting, soundtrack or anything else. And Neo, who is supposed to be ""The One"" comes back as an emotionally troubled geezer with amnesia who needs therapy the whole time.It was basically a disappointing disjointed flop.",4
801,"If you thought the Matrix ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" were from not as good to bad, think again! This was soooo bad that I fell asleep for a while (had to go back and forced myself to watch what I missed). It starts with a possibly intriguing ""theme"" and story line (you want to wait and wish for an amazing development) but it never lift off and even goes under. No really! Not only there are no surprises, the scenes, moves and special effects are all rehash of what you have already seen but it goes far beyond to get your bored to death: it is loaded of non-sensical characters appearing for no purpose (a recast of Morpheus and the same old / same old battle scene, the white rabbit he needs to follow ... why?? The oracle, the architect), it goes way down with abismal performance and dialogs that are flat, emotionless and feel forced. On top of that, you add the ""Neo! He is back"" like moments (with the usual jitter on the chair while plugged to the Matrix) and you have the perfect receipe for ""booooorrring!"". Even the end (recovering Trinity) is anti-climatic and not providing any surprises. There is nothing good about this addition and by the end, you would wish it would not have been made at all as it surely kills the aura associated to the first Matrix movie (that was admittedly, quite heart-pumping and mind-bending and a genre-starter). We expected so much more after so many years and all fans I am sure will feel a deep sense betrayal.This addition will not even end in the ""so bad that it is 'good' and becomes a cult movie"" category. This should have been called ""Matrix unsalvageable"", period!",3
802,The action and choreography are terrible. Vfx look like a made for tv movie. Say whatever you want about the sequels but those elements were solid. Especially Reloaded.The story and concept I liked for the most part besides the end which felt rushed and out of place. Lana said she didn't want to make this movie. She was going to quit after production got halted due to COVID until the cast convinced her to continue. It shows throughout the film.If they ever make sequels hopefully fresh blood with more passion and originality are behind it.,5
803,"Don't know where to start. I was so looking forward to this one. Nothing is good. Empty characters, Slow unoriginal plot, Multiple useless fights scenes without epic feel, wokism. Thx for ruining the legacy!",1
804,"If you ever wondered what the Matrix would look like if the WB Network produced television series, then wonder no longer the Matrix Resurrections has arrived. The story contains more retread filler than a high school student's exam essay, studying the material 15 minutes before the exam. The special effects harken back to the Battlestar Galactic series. The 1978 version with Ben Cartwright at the helm. I swear I could make out the wires for the Kung fu fight scenes, and I watched it on a 15-year-old Samsung streamed on HBO Max.",3
805,"Watched it twice and yep, it's terrible.Made for money and to show that only in the matrix can the director be what it claims to be.Just glad I never paid to watch it.",2
806,"""The Matrix"" has a complex legacy. It's first film is one of cinema's most iconic, reinventing action films for the 21st century. Its sequels were felled by bloat, parody and a focus on pseudointellectual waffle about choice. Twenty years later, this continuation of the story was, for me, a much better sequel - but I can understand why other people might not feel the same way.Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a game designer. Twenty years ago, his video game about a digital world acting as an anaesthetic to hide the truth about human existence was a big hit. Since then his life has been marred by mental illness, suicide attempts and an inability to accept his world as being real. He is approached by Bugs (Jessica Henwick) who tries to convince Neo that his instincts are right and he's back in the simulation, but if the events of ""The Matrix"" were, in fact, real - how is Neo still alive?I feel like the discovery of the meta way this film is dealing with the previous ones is going to govern your feelings about the rest of the film. It's not the first time that a film has played with its own mythology in this sort of way, but I felt that this was, in the context of the series, a clever way to go. It allowed this film to homage (and even directly show) the originals and ties back into the plot. The logic behind all of the films choices I thought was well done. Why the machines put Neo back in the Matrix, the explanation for why Trinity was there, the reskins for Morpheus and Agent Smith are all dealt with well. There are even meta gags for those with a deeper knowledge about the films, such as casting Chad Stahelski as Chad, a replacement for Thomas Anderson and John Gaeta as the designer arguing for more Bullet time.There's also a couple of reasonably good action scenes. The main one, a bike chase through the streets of San Francisco is really well done and ""swarm mode"" a reference to horde modes that various games have now, was clever if occasionally a little horrific. I liked a lot of the new characters and having watched ""Sense8"" it's nice for so much of that cast to get another chance to appear for Wachowski here.Faults mostly lie with the films slightly anticlimactic ending, for me. I'm not really sure why the . . . Villains . . (sorry, trying to remain spoiler free) stop coming after them. I'd liked to have spent more time outside of the construct and seen what's going on, but there's a chance for that if the film proves successful. (I fear one week between ""Spider-Man"" and this isn't enough for that to be the case though.)I think this is comfortably the best sequel to ""The Matrix"" and one of the better films I've seen this year.",8
807,"What all the people trashing this umpteenth copy of a copy are forgetting is that it doesn't matter what you all think about the product. All that matters is that you paid for it. The people in this industry have incredibly lavish lifestyles to maintain. Your $25 is merely 1/10th of a tank of petrol to take the lambo out for an afternoon joyride. So suck it up buttercup, and keep shelling out to check out photocopy #9 of INSERT MCU UNIVERSE SPINOFF here so that the industry suits can lord it over your sad little lives. Those private jets don't fly themselves!!The movie starts out excellently, then descends into wtf territory by suffering from a lack of tight editing of unnecessary scenes/sequences, and story elements. Could've been a contender instead of a mostly forgettable addition to the series.",6
808,"Bringing the Matrix universe back to the big screen after an 18-year absence was always going to be a daunting task. A pure screenwriter might recommend an entirely new approach to the subject matter, but that is not-for the most part-what transpires here. No, The Matrix Resurrections actually doubles down on its own intellectual property, if you will. While seemingly a recipe for disaster, Warner Brothers &amp; director Lana Wachowski construct a near-masterwork of meta self-reference and mystery.For a very basic overview, Resurrections opens in a familiar fashion to Matrix fans: a latex-clad woman (Jessica Henwick) being pursued by suited Agents. Is this a straight re-hash of the original's first scenes-or something more/different? Then, Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is introduced as a struggling programmer who once created a wildly successful trilogy of Matrix video games. He meets/observes a woman (Carrie Anne Moss) at a local coffee shop who makes him think/look twice and begins questioning the nature of his reality-a process that continues when he is visited by a figure claiming himself Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). Just what in the heck is going on here?!It is easy to look at Matrix Resurrections and write it off as WB touting its own IP or catering to nostalgia for the '99 original. Seeing as how the studio behemoth did the same thing with the new Space Jam, I get it. But this isn't Space Jam-not by a mile. Here, the meta-references to the original trilogy are inherent to the plot and serve to create an insatiable mystery that in many ways very much mirrors the intrigue of that mind-blowing original.What Resurrections really gets right is its ability to make the viewer legitimately question everything about their conceptions of the original trilogy. Did those events really happen? Was it all just a simulation of its own? Is what we are seeing now even ""real""? This is extremely difficult to pull off successfully, so I have to give kudos to Wachowski, who also shares writing credit with David Mitchell &amp; Aleksandar Hemon. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that Resurrections could capture even a sampling of the turn-of-the-millennium magic from The Matrix, but it does. I can say with no reservations that I was enraptured and mentally/emotionally engaged from beginning to end.Is Resurrections a perfect sequel? Not quite. Neil Patrick Harris plays a crucial role that let me down a bit, as does Jonathan Groff's character. The movie also cannot innovate visually the way the franchise once did, so the action sequences take somewhat of a back seat here (again, though, largely in service to the meta-narrative).Truth be told, I am a bit shocked that I enjoyed The Matrix Resurrections as much as I did! Though fully expecting it to heavily tap into my adolescent nostalgia for the franchise, I did not anticipate the 100% plot and character pivot into such storytelling. In many ways, the overall experience mirrored that of my first time watching the original film-slightly perplexed at times but utterly bought-in to the plot &amp; concept. What better compliment could I possibly give?",9
809,"None of the innovative fight scenes and stunts that made the original so exciting. Really odd villain casting choices and don't get me started on the attempted 'friendly' sentients. That sting-ray will haunt my dreams.Filled with literal clips from the original movies, I think the only goal for this film was nostalgia. It cheapens the original trilogy, which is worse than just adding nothing.Almost walked out half way through, but as The Matrix is one of my favourite films I really wanted to enjoy this - it was a shame it was so terrible.",2
810,"This is a rip off attempt at the original which was a classic. This is an insult to the original movie. This is a low budget, poorly written and poorly executed attempt at making a movie.This movie stunk so bad, it lost me within the first five minutes. At ten minutes I left the room. It was made for people with no IQ, no maturity, no sense of quality and no humor.All the characters in the movie are annoyingly terrible people. The kids, the adults, and the extras too. They all stink.The movie attempts with too much effort to try and be funny. Everything feels like it is forced and the responses from the actors reading their lines is like watching cardboard cutouts disintegrate in the rain.",1
811,"I remember watching the original back in 1999 and it blew my mind. The plot, the characters, the music, the atmosphere... So many memorable scenes. It was perfect. I still rewatch it at least once a year. It's so good.Welcome to 2021. I knew this is going to be a cash grab, but didn't expect it to be SO BAD. Weak characters, no memorable scenes or dialogues, everything about it is very generic and forgettable. It's so dull and boring I had a hard time staying awake (lol). They really put the last nail in the coffin with this one.And whats with that horrible remix of RATM Wake Up at the end credits? I was already pissed off by a terrible cash grab movie and they use this disgusting remix just to piss off the fans even more.",3
812,"Each of the previous Matrix movies before #4 made you want to watch the next installment. A Matrix movie.. Wow! ExcitingMatrix 4 achieved what most would think is the impossible! It made all of us never look forward to another Matrix movie again. It liked the franchise.And you can tell that not only was this installment a total cash grab but it also shows that none of the participants actually believed in the movie. The acting, storyline, cinematography seems like some college student working on their art project.Literally if you showed us a black screen for 2 hours we would have been happier and wanting more than what this movie managed. I actually fell asleep in many parts of the movie. In my 20+ hours this has never happened no matter how boring the movie or if I am just watching a movie in my bed. So I guess that's a second achievement ... Putting me to sleep.I feel actually embarrassed for the franchise.Nothing in this movie worked. They tried so hard to include way too many, I would say unnecessary, flashbacks in the hope of again trying to use the success of previous movies to give credit to #4. Massive signal that the crew of #4 didn't believe in #4Total F. L. O. P.I purposely didn't read the reviews before watching the movie but I wish I had and that would have stopped me wasting my money and time.Do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. Do your friends and loved ones a favor and tell them to read these reviews before even thinking of watching this movie.",3
813,This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my whole life. May as well have no connection the the original trilogy. This movie is going to prove to be a huge mistake for Keanu's career. Utter garbage.,1
814,"Walked out in middle of movie. First 1.5 is spent recollecting the old movies with montages and all. Does the audience not remember the original story? Matrix is a action movie with an awesome story. It's a lot of talking by middle-aged crisis characters trying to figure out who they were and their purpose in life. If I wanted that, I'd go to a retro-game shop. Never been so bored in my life. It's background noise you turn on while flipping through tiktok. Complete waste of time. Stop milking this franchise. It's done. You beat it to death. You cant resurrect it...",1
815,Terrible movie that never builds up any interesting characters or makes the viewer feel involved or care at all. The most impressive thing about this movie is that unlike the typical modern Hollywood cash grab where they can't come up with any decent new ideas and screw up an old movie with an unwanted sequel or remake this time it was the guy from the original trilogy that turned his own movie to trash. Amazing.,1
816,"A stain on the Matrix legacy. There was nothing original in the entire movie. They take the viewer back to all the old places, spit out the old lines, and even reincarnate the same characters into other bodies. If I wanted to watch the first three movies, I'd just put them on and re-watch them. I don't need to see them through this movie. The worst mistake in the entire film was breaking the 4th wall. Yes you can do that in marvel films and get away with it, but not here. The movie had no sense of danger in it, no suspense, no mystery to uncover, no new cool characters. Instead it was boring. Predictable. And a real joke to the franchise.",4
817,"I watched 30 minutes, that was enough. Boring, crap about the gaming industry, nothing happening beyond the first 5 minutes. It is possible something occurs later, but I'm not waiting for it.",5
818,"Yeah, we get it. You didn't want to make the movie but ""forced"" to do it. Then give the rights instead of ruining it for everyone. You don't get to make tons of money out of a project just to show people who spend their hard earned money to watch a nice movie that the story was over. This movie doesn't deserve a review.",1
819,"I was blown away by ""The Matrix"" in 1999. I was 14.Now over 20 years later I am blown away again, at how terrible this installment is.You have a space here for unlimited ideas! This is what you come up with?Overall, unwatchable with a very poor plot and acting.",1
820,"As a big Matrix fan of the original trilogy, I was hyped up to hear that a new movie was coming out. Then the bad reviews started coming in. Then how bad it did in the box office came in, then it was declared to be a flop, then it was announced that any potential for any future movies were lost as a result of the movie's poor performance. With each bit of negative news that came out, my hopes came crashing down. So when I finally saw it, my expectations were as low as they could possibly be.But even with such low expectations, I can still safely say that the movie was bad, like really bad. First, they spent so much time simply reenacting scenes from the previous movie, or simply showing flashbacks from them. Then they threw in a bunch of stupid plot points, several that went nowhere. Lots of things that happened in the movie are never explained, and a good deal of things are left completely inconclusive and never resolved, major plot points at that (my only guess is they were planning a sequel, that's the only explanation for how much was unresolved and unexplained). The action is average at best and not impressive at all. And the story is boring, if you can even call it a story at all. Yes, it had some identity politic stuff and things of that nature in it, but not much, and nothing that really impacted the plot or brought it down, but the movie itself was just bad. It felt like they found some random fanfic that a fan wrote and decided to make it into a movie. And then, after all that, the movie just ends, leaving everything up in the air and unresolved. It's immensely unsatisfying. You're constantly waiting for something to happen, but barely anything does, and what does happen is unimpressive.I'd say skip this one and keep the fond memories of the original trilogy where the series should have ended and was perfectly wrapped up. But you decide. Red pill or blue pill? Do you want to stay in the perfect fantasy world where the series ended after the third movie, or do you want to see how deep the rabbit hole goes... and then spend your time digging out of the mess? I'd say take the blue pill this time, because what you see is not worth destroying the greatness the original trilogy gave us. But as the Matrix keeps portraying, it comes to choice. Just be prepared for disappointment if you go forward with this one. I give it a 4/10 at most, and that's me being generous. For a comparison, a 5/10 based on my rating system is mediocre IMO.",4
821,Zero thought and effort was put into the making of this film. I am a big matrix fan and I honestly can't remember the last time I was this disappointed. The ending is soooo cringy. I just want to cry.,1
822,"Okay. This movie bombed!! Worse 2021 movie EVER.The first part, was decent with the merging of old code with flashbacks. However, the plot was made up as it went. Fishing for some symbolize of story telling and characters!! But why was this cast, yes even the main stars; Keanu and his co-star made to feel like middle aged outcast in a,movie that should have empowered and enriched not only the casts; new and established.",5
823,"Why would you resurrect the 2 most dangerous people that can destroy you? The real world is ok now, so why would anyone still want to stay in the Matrix. Near the end, Neo said they would unplug him, but they didn't until they flew away? Why didn't they unplug them before so they didn't have to avoid the swam and so on? There was a lot of other things that made no sense, but I don't want to write a book.",3
824,"What a terrible, horrible movie. Cheap acting, nonsensical scene changes, pointless plot all sprinkled with a facepalm worthy coating of modern era virtue signaling. This steaming pile should have never been made. Laurence Fishburne should consider himself lucky he wasn't called back. I feel sorry for all those involved.",1
825,Sad they had to devalue neo just to push female empowerment he was was suppose to be the one but now it's more likes he's number 2 definitely flushing the hard work done build a series.,3
826,"I love the ham-handed marketing ploy of having Keanu Reeves saying, ""See it three times to understand it."" That'll get those number up. Problem is, the movie isn't very difficult to understand. It just isn't very good. Just as the original sequels watered down the brand and and ultimately promoted a kind of fish-like mating paradigm, Resurrection goes to the next level and openly engages in behavioral instruction for the kids. And it takes itself quite seriously. Most actual adults will probably find it annoying.",2
827,"I didn't rated matrix 4 because i will not give a good score and i don't want to underrated it in respect of matrix trilogy before.Yeah they ruined even our earlier understanding of matrix how it works, but what really made me upset was bringing those actors with childish silly role dancing acting like Morfeous role and silly color.",
828,"I was really looking forward to this movie and certain there are 999 ways to make a sequel that would be a good Overall Movie. This is one was not to do it. They managed to loose my interest less than 60 minutes into the movie and even now I don't have anything to reflect on. Very different from the impact of the original Matrix. Also, two crucial actors are missing and I think they have great agents/advisors.",1
829,"This newest installation of the Matrix saga will always hold a special place in my heart; it was too bad to finish. The original trilogy was hurting by the end of the third movie, but it could have been laid to rest, and forever continue to ride the glory of the first installment.Alas, no. Greed and incompetence have again formed an alliance to defecate on all previous installments to make this newest abortion somehow relevant or interesting. It is not. It's a sorry mess of old tricks and actors that should know better rehashing old roles, combined with new characters and ideas that do not matter because there is no history and the performances are too weak to make any kind of impression even with the morbidly obese runtime allowed.Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving are all the greater thespians for not appearing directly in this drivel, or at least I hope they didn't; I opted out before the end.",3
830,"I didn't expect much but was interested because 1: It is Matrix lore (Original 3 + Animatrix are still outstanding to this day) and 2: because a Wachowski was still at the helm. Unfortunately, the Wachowski has forgotten how to craft with heart, soul, and precision, and seems to only care that every actor in the work is a flamboyant or trendy form of inclusiveness. No disrespect intended, but the only thing remarkable about this movie is how gay it was. Also catastrophically missing is Joel Silver or any production team that prevents the movie from coming off as cheap. Jason bournish cut-scene and shaky camera ""choreography"" does NOT belong in a Matrix movie (or in any film imo). Also, totally recycled sound effects and cheapened score. I get it, covid.. it's the never-ending excuse for all things lacking in the arts world the last 2 years and counting-- and millennials with their cell phones if covid doesn't stick. For real: That's the only thing Wachowski could come up with for the Merovingian? Another low-bar issue is constinual upper cuts to get it through our thick skulls that ""this is a matrix movie"".. (insert old stock footage here).. because you know, all Matrix fans have forgotten everything there is to remember about the original 3, including bullet time or who the characters are. Boring and insulting.The Matrix creator(s) have lost their way until further notice. Not only did this not feel like a real Matrix movie, but it didn't live up to any of the crafty, intelligent scripting and superb dialogue sequences that all Wachowski movies are known for. It was mundane and dumbed down to a cheap made-for-tv movie with an agenda, at best.",3
831,"You'll be dissapointed no matter how low your expections are. Trust me.For me this movie is comparable to ""Not another Teen Movie"". It is so silly and honesty poops on all the previous movies so that you only can take it as some kind of joke. Maybe they wanted to create something like Hot Shots? I don't know... maybe i just don't want to believe that they honestly thought that silly plot was a good idea.This honestly deserved 1 Star.",1
832,"Why make this film? It tries to be ironic, but it is still EXACTLY what we have come to expect from Hollywoke.You have to wonder why the other brother isn't involved in this film, when you watch it this becomes clear. It is a cinematic disaster.Of course it will make lots of money. You could brand a dumpster fire with Matrix stickers and it would sell, not that you would need to do that as this film exists.Neo has of course been emasculated and spends his time looking confused and pathetic while stronk womxn around him do all the heavy lifting. Only Funko pop collectors and Only Fans account holder will love this.Such a shame. The original was amazing. This is a Democrat advertising campaign.",2
833,"The Matrix Resurrections is the the 4th entry in the franchise, and perhaps the most unnecessary. The movie takes place decades after the previous films, and Neo is brought back for reasons. Morpheus and Agent Smith are recast but it's explained away within the movie as to why.The movie tries to be a throwback to the previous films with a few twists along the way (that can be seen from a mile away). A lot of archive footage is used and the movie tries to be a little to meta. Overall despite saying and doing a lot, this movie still felt empty and unnecessary. I was pretty bored at points and while the ending was action packed with a twist, this movie still doesn't feel needed. This movie is an average flashy spectacle, that tries to say more than it actually does.",5
834,"I hate this movie.The directors have the experience, time, money, resources, and actors. And still turned this great idea into a pile of trash.The first one is great and is still one of my favorites to this day.I was seriously so excited for this movie. But this 4th one is so bad, I have no intention watching it again.",1
835,"This movie is not The Matrix. This movie is very similar to The Last Jedi. The used the same title. They used some of the same characters, the soundtrack is completely different, the score is completely different, the color pallet is completely different, the timing is completely different, the pacing is completely different , the cinematography is completely different, there is virtually zero martial arts choreography . It is a completely different movie and you can feel it as soon as the opening credits end.",
836,"I was like the Wachowski sister can't even hold a candle to her brothers. But then I realized it was one of the original directors having a sex-change. Surprise! Maybe it was the other brother's (now sister, also) ingenuity in writing and directing that made Matrix so good and unique. This one can't even hold a candle to the original. Original Matrix was sylized and muted. This one was loud, over saturated and tried way too hard. It seemed like the actors the whole time were giddy about being featured on the Matrix movie. Oh goodie! Look at me! I'm the new Morpheus! The fact that this movie couldn't be related to the original was the fact that they had to show original footage of the original just to keep the audience aware they were watching another Matrix movie. This felt like a TV show ripoff. With fluffy ideas like machines as pets and Sati is all grown up now to love conquers all. It's sickeningly cliche. Not unique and daring like the originals were.",1
837,"I could write a review along the same lines of the other unhapy people that watched the Matrix Resurrections,but one word sums this movie up,just one simple word,Predictable,if you know,you know.",1
838,"How is it possible to be bored during a Matrix movie?Whilst it was great to see Neo &amp; Trinity back on our screens, the overall impression is a jumbled mess with some questionable cinematography, lacklustre action and a heavy reliance on footage from the first three films. The first act drags and at 45 mins I realised I was bored. Things pick up a little in Act 2 before dipping massively as we are introduced to new characters, Technologies and the lazy script writing is exposed.Some of this could be excused if the film was somewhat fun or even have highlighted that which The Matrix was originally known for.....stunning and amazing combat. Just think back to the Subway scene in Matrix 1, the clear, defined combat between Neo &amp; Agent Smith. How the tension was built, the significance of that moment, the comedy of when Agent Smiths glasses were broken and stunning combat - all had our jaws on the floor. Matrix 4 has instead regressed to cheap looking and ultimately very boring 'Jason Bourne' style of photography = shaky cameras, no real focus and unimaginative choreography (mainly because you can't see it). It took anything that was special and just stripped it out. A complete reversal from the first films and ultimately a fatal mistake.I cannot recommend this film - it will neatly fit into a number of lists that detail 'films that should never have been made'. There are moments of genius, but they are oh so fleeting. Ultimately very disappointing.",4
839,"New Matrix is sadly not on the level to even second and third film. It has some moments in the first part, but you soon realize after 30 minutes, that action is sloppy (you can see obvious sloppy wirework - worse than in first films 20 years ago.), obviously they cant use same actors for some reason - thats why story changed and other actors used instead. Story is hard to understand and many new faces not introduced well like in the first film- you dont know who is this even at the end. If you not really a Matrix die hard fan - watch it on streaming later. It has scene after ending titles - but dont waste your time to wait it - scene was strange for serious film.Overall it has some moments and twists- but most of it is incoherent but sometimes beautifully shot film.",5

What happened to Hugo Weaving and Lawrence Fishburne? Absolutely ridiculous. I'm sorry I wasted my time on this poorly constructed descrambled mess. Whatever fruit loop wachowski concocted this needs to return to the insane assylum for more therapy.,2

First of all I couldn't hear a word anyone was saying, it was like they where all speaking through clenched teeth to prevent them from catching the coof. It was mumbles all the way. So I watched it again at home with the subtitles on and who write this dialogue and why is half the film about nothing. Glad I watched it in the theater cause some of the action was cool but nothing, I mean nothing new.",5

This part doesn't make it look fading.Direction: I expected more, so I would say it was an average effort from director Lana.Final Verdict: I have always been great fan of Matrix trilogy. It were kind of based on some Indian philosophies. When the trailer first came out what came to my mind was concept of rebirth, where Neo &amp; Trinity are in Matrix and Zion is free. To add further Zion is free to free for those who want to be freed. A movie developed over such story would have been aced more.This is where I say the effort as average. The story puts love of Trinity and Neo first. This is where it becomes easy to develop.I am happy that movie is available to stream on internet without letting someone wait. So guys enjoy and spread positive word.",7
845,"So, no cool characters? No cool villains? Also the classic characters ones from the past movies all seem to have become losers. Starting with No-Superpowers-Neo. Most characters just turned out to be ANNOYING or BORING. The villain in this one is just Neil Patrick Harris as a psychiatrist??? Come on! I feel the whole project got lost in the very brainstorming in this particular episode. The mirrors, the game designing, the new machines... all decent ideas, but nothing out of the ordinary. Dead bodies jumping off the windows is not going to stop anyone in a motorcycle, much less The One. No plot twists, no surprises (except old characters showing up again in their worst versions), no real danger or anxiety. Nothing new to the philosophy of the entire Matrix concept.Neo lost his mojo, as did the Merovingian, Niobe, Smith.... The Chinese British girl and Morpheus were just nothing new or mind-blowing in any sense, rather just annoying millennials with no story. If Keanu Reeves or Carry Anne Moss weren't in this film, the whole thing would seem like a Nickelodeon low budget series.Damn! Missed opportunity!I rate 4 because I liked the conversations between Neo and Trinity at the Café. Also the new human city was dope.",4
846,"Sad to say this movie looks like a parody of what we used to know as the Matrix. By making insight jokes they break the 3th wall. This results in a most uncomfortable movie. The other thing that is extremely bad are the special effects instead of progression this movie shows regression. The fight scenes look so fake and slow passed.The story are has so many plot holes feels like the writers and directors were high on some bad cocaine.This movie is not worth your time I do understand that Keneau came back his misplaced loyalty to this dead franchise pulled him back in.Another franchise destroyed by Warner, that's 3 now Justice League, Mortal Kombat and add the Matrix to the list.",4

848,"The original Matrix was a watershed cinematic moment for me. I watched it, age 12, on a CRT television, and it completely changed my perception of film, philosophy, action, drama... and more. If this sounds exaggerated, It's not. That's because it made a true impact on me. Nothing life-changing, but thought-shaping? Definitely. There was something about the original film; it was a ballet of ideas, choreography, tone, style - it clicked on every level, and I loved it. I've loved it ever since that first time, and I have watched it probably 50 times over the past 21 years. The sequels didn't work for me, but I understood the story they were trying to tell, and the way they tried to tell it. It got pretentious, but at least it was cohesive. And the movies took themselves seriously. There was a real threat. There were real stakes. Things mattered. Over the years, I've realised that the original Matrix was lightning in a bottle, and I see it as its own, almost perfect thing. Which is why I was surprised and scared when the Matrix Resurrections was announced.""Why are they making this?"" I thought. The Wachowskis don't really seem like cash-hungry sellouts, so could it be that they've got a great new story to tell? The trailers had me cautiously optimistic as well. And then... Then I saw the first reviews trickle in. I just read the titles, but they confirmed some of my fears. And I debated, SERIOUSLY debated, whether to watch this movie at all. I did.What a sad, sad mistake. While I don't understand how someone can accidentally make something as good as the original Matrix, it's screamingly apparent that's exactly what happened. It was a fluke. And that is demonstrated clearly by Resurrections, a film so trite, tone-deaf and bland that I find it hard to even describe what I just sat through. I won't go through the plot - it's irrelevant. I want to share what didn't work for me. To start, this movie shouldn't exist. There's no narrative reason for this film to be. It doesn't tell an interesting story, it doesn't shape a new world, it doesn't subvert your expectations; it doesn't do anything, really. The movie trundles along from one digital scene to the next, and the stakes were so unclear that I felt like I was watching the film from a mile away. What doesn't help is that the cinematography is far too polished, which pulled me out of the movie constantly. Again, I won't dive into the plot, but it does absolutely nothing to keep you engaged.There were two distinct things that crippled this movie beyond redemption. Two things that make me almost certain of what I mentioned above: that the first Matrix was accidentally fantastic. And those two things are tone and choreography. See, the first three Matrix films took themselves seriously. That was critical, because it balanced out the increasingly ridiculous nature of the plot and the things we were seeing on-screen. The original Matrix is NOT a funny movie. It is a brooding dystopian drama, and that makes you invested in the plot and the people. Jokes were sparse. Good. However, Resurrections is a quip-a-minute romp, where every line is delivered sarcastically or with attitude, completely ruining the feeling of extinction-level stakes. Nothing matters because everyone seems to not care - why else would they all be joking around all the time? This is a fatal flaw of this film: if it doesn't take itself seriously, why should we?The second, choreography, might seem small compared to tone, but it's not. Remember how you felt whenever hand-to-hand or gun battles broke out in the original Matrix? Those shockingly creative, diverse, complex fight scenes that had you on the edge of your seat? That balance between power and vulnerability? The distinct styles? The menace in Smith's movements? That moment Neo says ""no"" in the hallway, and stops the bullets? None of that is here. Firstly, I heard that Lana Wachowski directed the action scenes. This was a hilariously arrogant error on her part. Every single fight doesn't just look generic; it looks dumb. That's unacceptable for a Matrix sequel. The hits don't connect, the camera constantly cuts like a Liam Neeson action thriller, there isn't a lick of originality in any move - we already know Neo can stop bullets (it's even in the trailer), so why do you do that eight times? Why is there nothing new? Why is the main big bad not formidable? Why have I seen better choreo in TV shows? Neo at one moment says ""I still know Kung-Fu""; well, he could've fooled me.All in all, I was left with a feeling of emptiness after watching this content-free, brightly coloured quippy sci-fi bonanza. I don't recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original film(s) and I hope they stop making these.",3
849,"This is just a cash grab film. Nothing new, just rehashing old ground that has been done before by the franchise.I found a lot of the film cringeworthy and transparent on how much they we're hanging on the coat tails of the previous versions.Where is Weaving? Where is Fishburne? To think that they can just be replaced and everything will be fine is insanely naive.Hated every second of it.",1
850,"As a huge fan of the original movies, I felt like this was a very pointless story to tell that had absolutely no depth. Completely different feel from the original matrix movies, which I'm all for trying new things but it didn't work.I felt like the director was just pushing her own views of how she went through her own life changes (much like the one becoming a woman - Trinity)The cast is a pale reflection of their originals. Morpheus &amp; Smith - while I am a huge fan of the actors, were nothing compared to Fishburne &amp; Weaving.Keanu and Carrie Ann have aged well but there was barely any fight scenes. I'm sorry but as much as I was looking forward to this, this was not a sequel worth making.",4
851,"The series got worse with every addition and this unnecessary mess didn't change that. The first film was pretty cool with some neat concepts if not some very wooden acting by everyone except our one and only Morpheus, the legend that is Laurence Fishburne. The second was enjoyable but you could see the cracks showing. The third movie was where it was supposed to all turn around and end with a huge bang! It didn't. It ended with a huge fart and a little confetti, it was over and we were ok with it. Now this is here, and it's even worse than the other three's worst failings combined. It's a tryhard film attempting to be cooler than it is with a plot that is yawn inducing because we've already seen it with a few faces changed before, but the technology was slightly worse back then. The young new sassy Twitter inspired characters aren't cool, they suck. Let it go, it's over. Try to make something new and better. Just...do a better job than you did with Jupiter Ascending for gods sake.",2
852,"This movie was so bad, I walked out after an hour as it was a waste of time. And I loved the original...The acting was really bad, especially by Neo, the script was pointless and this movie is a really really bad parody of the original trilogy.",1
853,"Am unable to continue watching this film, i get where one of the Wachowski was taking the story, it somehow makes sense but the story needs to go back to the drawing board.Maybe in an alternate future i will try and finish the film, maybe if both Wachowskis wrote it, it would make sense but now comes the truth why Andy didn't want to work on this, the story isn't ready.The film needs a remake, a serious one and don't call it Matrix 5 or something, use the original cast, keep the story spine of the first film constant in each reality or matrix world created.Unfortunately i feel disappointed, i was really hyped with the trailer, but the movie felt like watching a deep fake, sorry matrix fans.",3
854,"So there i was expecting at least some interesting and big visuals, and what i got was a tv level hallmark movie about two aging superheroes absurdly underproduced piece of dreck that looks like it it was filmed on a smartphone with no artistic flair whatsoever.The matrix scenes look like soap opera, the real world scenes look like cheap Star Trek.It is unbelievable that a sequel to a series that revolutionized scifi visuals does not have one single memorable scene.You want choreographies? Forget it. You want well filmed action? Nahhhh, not a single one. Cool.sentinels and hardware, maybe? Some superpowers, missions or mistery about what is going on? Nope.There are a few fights and brawls, but they have no Matrix elements whatsoever, and mostly look like a zombihorde attacking in the dark. Horrible b movie visuals, unbelievableThe editing, cinematography and music all seem like a rushed tv movie, and the grandeur from the original series is not present here.The only true Matrix here are the countless flashback scenes which only remind us how unimaginative and underproduced this isIn the 90s this would have been a dtv sequel in the dollar bin.There are scenes of yuppies and nerds discussing the original matrix, reboots and remakes..in the movie itself.The only story here is Neo and Trinity being the Matrix God together, not just Neo.You don't need two hours of people talking to achieve that.This would have been somewhat acceptable as a 20 minute YouTube short. Probably a hint that the director's sibling is the artist in the family.",
855,"I watched this with my wife. There may be spoilers. To be honest, I wasn't even sure what the plot even was through 75 percent of the movie. Felt like neo's quest to go back for trinity was a side quest..but at the end felt like that was suppose to be the main plot. They where at peace with these machines, and they just happened to search for neo (found him and rescued them) They pretty much did same things as the first movie...rehabilitating his mind. Through out this segment, they would flash cut scenes from the other movies..and even say ""one liners"" all through the movie. Basically to pull on your nostalgia strings. Agent smith actually helps the good people.. however there is no good explanation. Agent smith was some how imprisoned like neo was. Even though they do have a fight, he helps neo out basically for himself...I guess? (point I am making is, that this needed more character development)I guess this movie is good if you are a casual movie watcher, but if your hard core into the lore of these movies.. You will be very disappointed.",5
856,"Neo is not The One as Trinity proves to be his better in a female empowered and woke reboot.Action scenes are subpar compared to previous films. It's basically a remake that centers on empowering females in the new Matrix founded on feelings instead of reason. As such, Neo is emasculated under the new construct and Trinity empowered. The point is that anyone can be The One given the rules of the construct.The new construct changes the founding rules to empower a female in the protagonist role of The One.",2
857,They gave the 90s trilogy the worst ending ever possible. The movie from the starting was very boring I slept through the entire movie. Warner Bros wasted their money by approving this brainless movie. They could have added any kind of scene they wanted now they have the technology to show the limitless possibilities of VFX rather than that they thought to bore their watchers. I do not recommend anyone watching this movie because it's a complete waste of time.,3
858,"There's no rising tension. The conflict seems to have no weight. The action sequences feel cluttered and sloppy and never reach anything near the heights of those in the original trilogy. The few good concepts that this movie brought to the table were never explored enough to produce any sense of satisfaction. This movie was barely held together by shameless callbacks and fan service.Now on to the nitpicks. So remember in the Reloaded when Neo stops the bullets with his hand? It was iconic because when he did it, it was our first time seeing it and he did it once. In the final conflict for this one, he did it 4 times (or at least that's what I counted). It made something that was initially great feel very cheap. Also, nobody dies. Not a single one. Not even the characters who could easily be used as fodder. They all come out okay. It took any sense of danger that the characters may be facing and threw it out the window.All I can say more is that this movie was a disappointment and a wasted potential.",2
859,This one felt like a B movie that you play on the new years eve at 6:00 AM when everybody is drunk but have 2 neurons still active.Very painful to watch.I would have rate it 0/10 but sadly this is not an option.Big crash grab.Just a big big memberberry.Stay away from it.,1
860,"Whew! It's a toss up between this movie and ""Rise of Skywalker"" for the worst movie I've seen. Predictable and uninteresting. I would've rather seen a movie that took place after the third and before this one. It was painful to watch this whole movie but I felt like I needed to finish it. Glad I didn't bother seeing this in the theater.",3
861,"The Matrix Resurrections is the fourth film, in the Matrix franchise. Mr. Anderson(Keanu Reeves) has to once again find out, if he's inside the Matrix &amp; must choose to find out the truth about his world.The Matrix Resurrections is a great movie. Writer-director Lana Wachowski has given us a more self-aware and tongue in cheek sequel to a trilogy, that really didn't need a fourth installment. These meta references to the original trilogy are the highlight of the film. The action set pieces are brilliant. Keanu Reeves is spectacular as Neo. Carrie-Anne Moss is outstanding as Trinity. Reeves &amp; Moss share electrifying chemistry, in all their scenes together. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is impressive as Morpheus but, I definitely missed Laurence Fishburne. Jonathan Groff is memorable as Smith. Jessica Henwick is awesome as Bugs. Neil Patrick Harris is hysterical as The Analyst. Jada Pinkett Smith is good as Niobe. Priyanka Chopra Jonas is superb as Sati. The supporting cast is effective. The Matrix Resurrections is worth a watch, for fans of The Matrix trilogy. Just keep your expectations, relatively low.",8
862,"When watching this film, you can see that it has some fantastic ideas. New, Fresh and interesting characters, I really like some of the new characters in this film. Great performances and chemistry by Keanu, Carrie-Anne even though I felt that their teen/young-adult type romance made no sense given their age.The main problem I had with this film is the way everything was executed. All those great ideas and experimental concepts didn't work out at all. I sat through the film waiting for the wow and awe moment that is synonymous with Matrix films and I got nothing.I am not completely disappointed, my rating is an expression of how I felt about the movie.",5
863,"Fortunately, I already expected this to be bad. It smelled like a cash grab from the day it got announced. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, asked for this. Yet, it still managed to exceed my expectations... 'cause it's even way worse than than I thought.I'm doing my best not to go into the woke side of things. Nowadays these matters simply go without saying, and it seems to be a sad fact we'll have to live with for the foreseeable future.The whole thing is just a parody. It HAS to be. Even the story basically takes this route. It's one big inside joke of its own success. Of the trilogy that is. No atmosphere, no visual filter, incredibly stale acting by a terrible cast, sad attempts at Marvel-esque jokes by extremely dislikeable characters, and saturated with flashbacks to fill-up this two and a half hour torment. Even underutilizing Jessica Henwick's fantastic physical skills. It might as well have been a Nic Cage movie.If you must see it, then PLEASE, do not lose any money over it.",1
864,The only reason it gets a 3 is because of NPH...this movie was awful. I they over did Easter eggs everywhere and if you didn't notice them you need your eyes checked. I mean those things are normally subtle and you you really have to pay attention to see them but not in this movie. Also it was over produced and just blah.,3
865,"This was a B movie. The cinematography was cheap. The costumes were cringe cosplay versions of the first film. Everything about this film felt cheap, The writing was cringe. The performances were canned. The movie had clips from the original films. It felt like a low budget fan film on youtube. Truly an awful cringe fest of a film and god have mercy on Lana Wachowski's soul for making this film.",1
866,"I spent years waiting excitedly for the next chapter of this story. George Lucas continues to vomit on us all for reasons I dont fully understand, but I knew I could count on you Keanu. And yet, here it is.....total garbage. We have all seen how happily Hollywood will throw its own children into the jaws of Weinstein for 10 minutes of fame, but I never saw you as one of them Keanu.... I thought you were one of us. But suddenly it would appear that I am Neo and you are Agent Smith. Thats a lot of responsibility to throw at other people. WTF?",2
867,"OH NO. CRINGEEEEEEE!(Honestly, I don't really want to make any other comments about the movie, I'm writing this in parentheses to fill in how many characters. Cringe af btw.)",1
868,"Why is this Matrix movie made? Waited for twenty years and you get this B movie. The story had great potential but executed very bad. Most of the special effects are bad for some weird reason and the story is messed up. Some scenes are ok but if you are fan of the first movies, don't watch this one.",2
869,"Why can't they leave ""The Matrix"" alone?! Why not just let it be? This movie is not worthy of the original! The whole story is a convoluted mess which totally feels like an afterthought and exists only to connect the otherwise disjointed action sequences.And as far as action goes, it's over the top, there's too much of it and just like the story, it doesn't make any sense.Honestly, save you money and watch it on Netflix or something. This movie is not worth your money. It is horrible.",1
870,"The ""How do you do fellow kids"" is super strong in this.1 point for visuals.1 point for the milliseconds of Hugo Weaving.1 final point for Moss who was the only one who seemed human in the whole film.",3
871,"What a convoluted mess of a movie. A disgrace to the original. Story was embarrassing, disjointed and nonsensical. The special effects and action sequences were lacking tension and were downright amateur. Actually I've seen better amateur productions. Morpheus has been turned into some kind of joker pimp - whaaa?. Just an awful movie and everyone involved should hang their heads in shame. If you like the original then just watch that. Don't for a second believe the positive reviews of this movie.",3
872,After 20 years this is a shame to see what the hell happened to Matrix. Where is the unique atmosphere and green tint of Matrix movies and what about action and fights? Dead people are alive and alive people are dead! Who are a bunch of losers in the end action sequence with sun glasses? And what the hell happened to The Wachowskis ?! Lack of creativity? Please respect your audiences. You destroyed all of great memories from The Matrix series.,1
873,"I really wanted to like this, and I admit it has its moments, but even considering the hate of the second and third installment, this is the worst matrix movie of them all.The dialogue seems superficial, uninviting and even comic at some points. The pace of the movie is too consistant, and gives no room to breathe and enjoy the depth and thoughts of any of the characters.The ""matrix is a game"" theme could have worked, but ended up as an unfunny parody.Even the song in the ending I would guess should be a nod to the rage against the machine track used in the original, but using ""Brass against"" is another cringe worthy parody.Save your theatre money and watch it on your couch a sunday afternoon, when you have nothing else to do.",6
874,"It is preferable to refer to it as ""The Matrix Retirement"" rather than ""Resurrections."" I believe they completely destroyed the franchise, and they had the unique ability to make the public regard the first film as a joke. In my entire life, I have never witnessed a more self-destructive move in film production. It's time to save ""Tiffany""! For God sake!",1
875,"I absolutely can appreciate that films require a certain amount of suspense of reality, but this movie begs you to forget about reason, logic, plot, and what happened in the scene 3 minutes ago. So much was laughably bad throughout, I started making a list of things that just didn't make sense but halfway through there was too much to keep track of. NPH and Jonathan Groff were INCREDIBLE, as always, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen continues to amaze me in the few performances I've seen him in. Save yourself a trip to the theater, and if you REALLY want to watch it, go for the HBO route so you can pause it while you laugh at how the movie can't remember its own rules.",3
876,"Another year, another reboot movie by committee. I'm not sure what's worse, the movie's core lack of understanding of what made the original movies such an cultural icon, or its tasteless and mindless references to the original while simply reenacting the scenes. This was a disgusting watch and an absolute insult to the intelligence of its audience.",1
877,"This movie is pretty poor. It's a mess. Dialogue is dreadful, the acting, other than the main leads, is amateurish but the whole self reverential story line (with cuts to the original movies) is simply atrocious. And? 'Deus Machina'? Wee bit insulting to the intelligence of the audience.The scenes of the 'brainstorm' sessions (gamestorming?) has some of the worst acting I've ever seen in such a high profile film.Deeply disappointing movie. Arguably it was impossible to get beyond the original film which was simply a genre breaking, generation defining science fiction masterclass. It's been the law of diminishing returns ever since. Sadly.",4
878,"I had hoped that they spend 20 years coming up with a mind-blowing movie, like The Matrix did when it first came out in cinemas. But no. More CGI-bullcrap and explosions and generic action movie template. Not any new, fresh imagination, no awesome revelations, no nothing. Sure, there was this part with Trinity, but it seems so bad and out of place and not 20 years of waiting worthy. There aren't enough substance in this movie. It's yet again quantity over quality, and not respecting the source material anymore.If you must make a new movie, at least make one that redefines the movie world like the original did. You are the victim of what you tried to avoid - being one with the masses, not being the Chosen One. This movie is just an assimilation, a decoy, a part of the Matrix. Don't be The Matrix. Be the Neo.",2
879,In short:Put Neo in a wheel chairChange the movie name to : Zombie landMovie budget: 200 USD MaxStory line : written by a drunkYou will not enjoy this movie.,4
880,"The story was bad. It didn't feel like a matrix film. The meta was terrible.Neo is now a game designer (in the matrix) and his first 3 games were the matrix. Now Warner brothers are forcing him to create a sequal and he doesn't actually want to make it. OK Lana, you wernt exactly subtle here, but you could have still tried to make a decent film. I know you wanted toa stick your middle finger up to those at WB but you didn't need to do it to the film fans.Gone are the interesting characters. Gone are the interest plot points. Gone is the great cinematography, martial arts and action sequences. Replaced with them are B grade copies of your fav characters and the action scenes are pieced together with short cuts and shaky cam. Yes you heard that right.. Action sequences are shaky cam as it covers for the lack of martial arts specialists they had for this film.CGI is bad and so is the green tint. Now you have film as generic as Michael Bay movies.... But less interesting. The film constantly references the previous movies which makes you feel sad because all you think was ""I wish I was watching that movie instead""",1
881,"From the early appearing trailers of movie it looked somewhat promising, but extremely risky to continue with sequel on such spectacular trilogy. And yet, to put in short, the choice for continuing with the sequel was a cardinal sin. Matrix 4 was worse than Home Alone 4. If it is a beginning of another trilogy, oh boy, I can't even apprehend what utter garbages awaits us in the future.",1
882,"I have indicated spoilers just in case I slip up on this review.Literally, this movie serves no purpose.Being a fan of the original trilogy and its philosophical / religious / societal / political implications and exploration, this film does not fit in to the saga in any way, shape, or form.The plot was nothing but recycled and insignificant bits of the original trilogy, not to mention direct exploitation of plot holes from the original trilogy.Production quality was significantly poor by today's standards, and Lana Wachowski should be ashamed of this waste of talent, story, and money.The Matrix is dead, and died with Revolutions. This is nothing but a poor cash grab.",1
883,"It was rushed, and showed through the many plot holes. It broke the 4th wall, and was inconsistent with the previous instalments, even becoming a caricature of itself. It had had lazy acting and writing which felt uninspired and disengaged the viewer, and even changing the story from the original Matrix trilogy. Aside from confusion and many unanswered questions, it added very little to the Matrix lore.I tried to give it a second viewing, and while it started good, it quickly became boring, and stopped watching when the problems became too obvious to ignore. So, if you're a Matrix fan, be warned: you may or may not like it.I think this movie would have been better as a tight 20-30m epilogue story in an Animatrix 2.0 anthology. As a result, I won't be considering this film as part of The Matrix lore, and will remain satisfied with The Matrix original trilogy, the Animatrix, and The Matrix comics.4/10.",4
884,"Should have left the Matrix where it was. This new one is not a patch on them and I was bored bar the action sequences. Too much talking going on and one of the helicopters vanished when 2 were shooting at them on top of a building for no reason after other one got blown up which is bad. Only 2 of the original cast in this movie which was a shame. All in all, not impressed.",3
885,"They managed to completely ruin this series also.What a pile of crap, I could not finish the movie, since when is this meant to be comedic?Man Hollywood would produce anything these days.I want my time back.",1
886,"""No one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)Although I am not the best person to ask about what happened in the three previous installments of The Matrix, the new high-concept thriller The Matrix Resurrections makes some sense because writer-director Lana Wachowski (helming solo without sister Lilly) and her colleagues have crafted a saner story with a classic romance (well, maybe classic only a bit). The usual slo-mo bullets, shape shifting, and outrageous homage to virtual reality are there but framed around the reunion of Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity/Tiffany (Carrie Anne Moss).Although the duo is resurrected from their deaths in Revolutions, how the filmmakers justify the two resurrections I'll leave to sci-fi geeks who eat up this meta-commentary on virtual reality. Because of Neo's longing to reunite with Trinity, I found myself analyzing how Reeve's previously wooden responses now seem genuine. It's because he has such a low-affect anyway, that snooze is transformed into a deeply-felt emotion coming out of a place only love could make surface.For those who care at all about the history of cinema, approach Matrix Revolutions as a reboot with new takes on its own concept that itself is unwieldly and at times inscrutable. If you are into this Christopher-Nolan-like mind-puzzle, you'll delight in the twists and turns that say Lana Wachowski is leaving the previous three installments for new territory. Then again, it's old hat, love and all that, but it feels good on my head.""Nothing comforts anxiety like a little nostalgia."" Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen)",
887,"An absolute disgrace to the matrix name. So poorly written, terrible acting, just all around. If you're thinking about watching it, don't. Just think about what *you* think this movie should be and let it be that. Because I guarantee it's worse than what you think it is.",1
888,"I felt shame having done the ""curiosity click"" 30 minutes in, and turned it off. I've hit a brick wall with reboots, and won't do it. I've actually never turned a movie off early before; I dread some random urge causing me to even skip through this nightmare product to see how bad it gets.Everyone has their sappy ""I love that movie, I can't believe they've done this"" moment; and mine is for the Matrix. It never occurred to me just how absolute the reality is that the Hollywood machine can, and will, target anything and everything of old to reboot in order to fill their void of talented writers/directors (a dying breed).There is a ""Last Jedi"" feel that I got with this film: the 4th wall breach with self-referential inserts, the attempt to subvert the original 3 movies, the flashbacks, the cringe-inducing forced humor (particularly the ""modern tech hipster talk"": my spine is probably injured from the cringe); it comes off as parody but confuses itself in wanting to be an artistic work.From a technical level, this film is beyond the pale compared to the original Matrix. If you watch the original, you'll notice careful color grading of scenes, planned cinematography for things as simple as character introductions, meaty and meaningful dialogue that tickles your brain; you know, those effortful endeavors to enhance storytelling with artistic mastery.This film does none of that. It exists because the original Matrix exists, and that's all you need to understand. It's not a film; it's a husk wrapped in the success of previous people who are no longer focused on making a story. It's kind of like a zombie: resurrected, with characteristics of what makes its previous form move and operate; but like a zombie, its focus is no longer on productive challenges and seeking new heights of achievement, it's only focus is consuming (your wallet).Hollywood is not concerned with art anymore; their focus is on what brand to reboot next. The Matrix they inhabit is, indeed, laced with the color green.",2
889,"Started off initially interesting, but then descended into an overly convoluted mess. Tries to be too clever, just ends up being too complex. Frequent nods to the past films very unnecessary and lazy.In the end, just an annoying mess.",5
890,Just finished watching the movie...spent the last 1 hour with cringe expression on my face and counting the minutes to finish. This is not a matrix movie. Complete garbage.,1
891,"Not worth my while, it's a really BAD spinoff. Just a waist of time. Even Morpheus is a bad copy of the original actor. The story went from how is that possible to "" you had to much durgs and alcohol"" that night.",2
892,"About 15 seconds in, I knew the vibe was off and that it should be more riveting, for a Matrix franchise film. Then I started thinking about other films I did like watching, and drifted further away from the film. The first 40 mins is utter trash and does not fit at all. Then the 'true' matrix vibe returned and it got slightly better, but it didn't last.2.5 hours of my life I'll never get back. My sweets from the pic n mix were nice, though.",1
893,"3.5 out of 5 stars.The Matrix Resurrections is a pretty fair science fiction action film that succeeds as a sequel in continuing the franchise. After the third film Revolutions concluded the story arc. Yes, it succeeds as a sequel. Yes, returning characters like Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, and even Jada Pinkett Smith making almost an unrecognizable appearance. The story is a bit mix, it works and also feels kind of weak compared to previous films. It works in continuing as a fourth installment without giving too much details. Old characters making a return as new faces played by new actors like Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Jonathan Groff. Jessica Henwick also stealing the spotlight as Bugs. Neill Patrick Harris playing an Analyst.The story is pretty decent. Characters back in the Matrix world. And new threats are on the rise. The future world is also running a little different as well. Story is weaker compared to the trilogy which a lot is at stake. Resurrections is reigniting the franchise. And maybe opening the doors to something more if they make sequels.The action sequences are awesome. Slo mo is back with characters fighting and dodging bullets. The climatic motorcycle chase with Trinity and Neo being chased by an army of swarm bots that's taking control of the people is thrilling. The visual effects are cool and the futuristic world is stunning seeing that back on the big screen.Keanu Reeves is back as Neo. Starting the film feeling lost in the matrix world did have a slow start for the first half hour. Carrie Anne-Moss playing Tiffany who is a mother and has a family now was different. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is decent in his role which is different for the character he is playing. Jessica Henwick is awesome as Bugs and stole the show. Jonathan Groff also is great as the new agent and also stole the spotlight for his short role. Neill Patrick Harris is good as the analyst. Priyanka Chopra Jonas is good playing a character that has a connection from previous films.The weakest part about the film besides the story not being its strong moment. The pacing of the film can be slow at times or run a little too long at dramatic moments. The film did have a slow start until Neo noticing something is wrong with the world.Overall, The Matrix Resurrection is a pretty fair come back with mind blowing action, visual effects and cast ensemble. Pacing and story might be its weak points. It was great to see it in theatres.",7
894,"Charmless is the first word that struck me when I watched this.In the first Matrix they had cool clothes that made statements when they fought (like billowing leather long coats), had cool hair cuts and drove a cool car (the Lincoln). There was no style or statement pieces here. The story was simple and the bad guy was obvious. Agent Smith was superb (thank you Hugo Weaving) and had a single minded personality with a slightly sarcastic sense of humour and a machine. This Agent Smith was, to all intents and purposes human. I would have liked to seen more of him to redevelop the character but he just wasn't in it long enough as were none of the other agents along with the body take over. Now it's just a cheap look in there eyes (a matrix reflection).Too much talking, way too much. I'm sure they answered all the questions I had but I don't want to sit there listening to an hours worth of fast talking commentary just to explain a weak story line. They developed strawberries, introduced new characters but still wear raggedy jumpers. Weird.It didn't hold my attention and it was obvious Neo and Trinity (or rather Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss) couldn't perform the necessary action sequences and so they were few and far between and very unoriginal. They looked like they were going to hurt themselves which at 50+ they would. I also see Hollyweird still has issues with older woman for age appropriate characters (Jada Smith as an old wise General). Jonathon Groff and Neil Patrick Harris were pretty good, just not enough time to develop there characters. The rest of the supporting cast just seemed to hang around and contribute nothing. Absolutely destroyed the Morpheus character.Not sure why this was made, no real story line, weak character development, didn't follow previous Matrix movies, over done CGI, stilted acting from Keanu Reeves and just a tad vapid.Its a 4 because it should have been a 3, hope they don't make anymore.",4
895,"And BS walks. I was looking forward to this since I heard it was being made. I really enjoy the Matrix movies and was ready to see what happened.Well talk about a snoozer, I fell asleep in the first hour of the movie. Thank God I was watching on HBO or it would have been a waist of money.After I woke up from my movie induced nap I picked up where I fell asleep. It did pick up a bit but was a bug waist of time.I think the only way big names would agree to be in this dribble is for the money offered.Don't waist your time. It isife you will never get back.",5
896,"But you get a pile of garbage with extra large side of stupid. This movie is not worth watching. It should have been not even straight to DVD, but straight to VHS. Nobody should see this movie, nobody.Keanu Reeves, Carrie Ann Moss, Jonathan Groff were great. Acting was really good, except Pryanka Chopra, who was the worst in the ensemble. What fails this movie is the story. So many stolen ideas, plot holes, clichés.... Why was this movie even made? Garbage. I am rating this movie two stars for the acting, but even the great bunch of great actors could not save this dumpster fire of a movie. So not worth your time, anyone's time.",2
897,This movie has it's head so far up it's own ass it came out just like you'd expect.I used to watch the original movie once or twice a year. I'll never be able to rewatch that or any other Matrix property ever again.,1
898,"What have they done here? Is this supposed to be a parody and they forgot to put in some real laughs? It's like a 100 million dollar Fan Film on Youtube. Sometimes it is as ridiculous as a Monty Python movie, sometimes just plain stupid. But never ever is this a Matrix movie. It is a movie that mocks Matrix, that makes fun of Matrix and neer takes itself or the Matrix lore seriously. This is a blockbuster that says: I hate blockbusters and sequels are bad. This is a sequel that hates the original and everything in it. Keanu sleepwalks through his ridiculous dialogue and in the action scenes he moves like Steven Seagal in his latest movies. Or is it real time bullet time? I don't know.The movie is stupid and from start to finish I was just hoping it will end soon.If you stay for the after credits it is even clearer: This one doesn't want to be Matrix 4. The movie is Lana Wachowskis and Keanu Reeves way to say: F....you Warner Bros. You wanted a sequel - we gave you one and made it as dumb as possible.",1
899,"A big disappointment, it was a very simple movie. It's like it was fake production...zero action scene, illogical fiction, simple image, simple acting, if we compare it with the trilogy 1-2-3, this is a seriously amateur production, I wish it had never been shot...Matrix 4 was pure rubbish..I will always remember it as 1-2-3 Final 👈a big disaster after so many years you can destroy this major work so... buhh!!! To the makers... There is actually more to criticize...",1
900,"I do not have words, why so good movie in past was destroyed.Lana why you spot on the matrix fans? I understand you maybe hate warner b. But why you hate all people and maded just so bad matrix 4 ?Movie is just terrible... I do not want to live in this planet anymore if scifi is dead.... it is just terrible movie.",1
901,"I don't have any hate for this film. I was looking forward to watching this as I saw the first movie in the theater when it first opened.I don't think I was looking for a repeat of that as it would be like getting hit by lightning twice. What I was hoping for was a return of that universe, the look, action, philosophy, music etc.None of that was on the screen for this film, or it was but so brief as to not change my opinion of it.A lot has been said about the film being too meta and I have to concur even though I've heard some good reasons why this was a creative and bold attempt at movie creators to signal movie companies and producers that they need to stop pushing luke warm sequels. This message gets lost in the overly direct way it is done imo and also goes on for far too long.About thirty minutes of this and then the movie takes a 180 into the very movie they were poking fun at.As for the rest. Dialogue and acting thereof was very poor at times. Reeves reaction to being offered the blue and red pills could have been an outtake. Moss's suddenly deciding she is indeed Trinity was eye rollingly bad.NPH cast as a mustache twirling villain, cracking wise was simply not believable and not in keeping with the idea of who the machines are and the mood of the film while he's in it.Action scenes were subpar for the most part. Shot very close and with quick edits. Little choreography that compares to the trilogy.Some of the effects were downright awful looking while some looked amazing.And, I guess the last thing I thought of after watching it is why it was made. Lana should have let WB hand this to another director in hindsight. She appears to be too close to the material while also not passionate about having to make it..or at least she felt she had no choice. She certainly did.",4
902,"Remember the first Matrix movie? So many iconic scenes throughout the movie. From the Rabbit tattoo, to the office scene when he gets the cell phone to the subway fight to the woman in the red dress to the steak eating to the cookie baking to the spoon bending to the truck smashing into the phone booth to the Morpheus interrogation to Morpheus rescue in the lobby to elevator shaft to the helicopter machine gun scene and so many more. Well, The Matrix Resurrections was the opposite.The Matrix Resurrections started off ok. A reminder of the Matrix story to set up the rest of the movie seemed like a good idea. But it didn't take long to understand this wasn't to be the case. Far from it actually. It went slowly downhill from there. The only reason it went slowly, was because the movie is two and a half hours long. It felt like double that.Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss looked great. This movie wasn't their fault. The story was unoriginal and forgettable. It focused way too much on the first Matrix movie rather than having its own identity.The only good thing about The Matrix Resurrections is we won't have to waste anymore of our lives watching another sequel.1.1 out of 10 for me.",1
903,"No review I could write could do proper justice to just how bad this movie is. Most of my time watching this was spent asking myself ""What the hell is going on?""On top of the bad writing, directing, cutting, and acting, they've also decided to make the movie woke.I don't even know what to say...",1
904,"Matrix 4 is in line with movies the like Star Trek und Star Wars, they are mostly feeding on ideas, characters and whole scenes of their ""ancestors"". Without them, they are mostly just empty shells without new ideas udn without any life. Such is the case with Matrix 4. Nothing really new to be seen here, lifeless characters and a lame story. But CGI you get, what sums up the misery of todays movie scene.",3
905,"This IS the worst movie I've ever seen. I literally forced myself to watch to the end, hoping it would make sense and get better.The storyline just made no sense. I was wondering why Laurence Fishburne was not among the cast, he wouldn't want to wreck that which was great. Save your money and your time, this is a sequel that s**ks!",1
906,"Lana herself admitted this movie was made just to let her cope with a personal tragedy and she needed people around her. Now this is not the best reason to make a sequel to one of the best movie trilogies and from frame 1, it shows. Just poor special effects, poor action, poor quick edit shots, just so ho hum. I mean actors also give the most wooden straight face acting I have ever seen. I know Keanu is no Oscar level actor but damn man, what happened? The original Matrix was very pre planned, every camera angle written down and set up before sets and action were shot, it showed. As if a comic book came to life. This needed 1 year of pre planning and 1 year of shooting including pickup shooting. The movie really looks like a couple of B rehearsal shot's that were good enough. Now I understand with Covid and lockdown's etc, they could have had big logistical issues but damn, a movie like this has to be made right, better to delay the release and get it right. Thus this 4th sequel looks like a TV movie. Wowza. Lana, what happened?",4
907,"This movie does not know, what it's meant to be. Is it a non-sensical comedy with rehashed scenes from the first great Matrix? This movie is so bad, that I fell asleep about 5 times. What made it even worse is, that it did not matter. This is utter garbage and not film-making. It is a cash grabber, with a femininist woke agenda, where men are just irrelevant, nothing else. Don't waste your time.",1
908,"Worse than the dentist...so done with these ""woke"" movies. Terrible on a level I cant even describe... No part of this incoherent rubbish can even remotely be compared to the original trilogy.WHY BOTHER ????",1
909,"What the Hell was that meta piece of garbage I just watched? If you thought the end of Matrix: Revolutions was anti-climatic and unsatisfying, be prepared feel that way the entire movie. Wow... What utter trash. How did this movie get greenlit and why would any original character agree to do this???",3
910,"As with the original Matrix the further the makers took us down the rabbit hole the duller it becameAnd as with the trilogy so this newer version is just tepidMaybe it's the more modern films and the complex CGI that make this feel like ""same old same old""and nothing out of the ordinary which is a shame as I'd hope the time between episodes would of let a writer somewhere somehow come up with a fresh exciting story line but in keeping with the two follow on's. It fails to live up to the original.",5
911,"Matrix 2 and 3 are below average film, how did you expect this movie to turn out? No real Agent Smith, poorly filmed fight scenes. All I have to say that it is a good thing the film did not take itself seriously or else it would have been a sadder experience.",3
912,"Resurrections was silly, shallow, constant flashbacks, exposition and lacked any magic. I was ready to turn it off 30 mins in. The original Matrix is my fav movie, saw it in the theater in 1999.",3
913,It was so bad... that I don't have words to discribe it. Never watch if you don't want to compromise your memory about old Matrix.Every single moment is stupid and not logical.,
914,"This movie would've been awesome if it was a low-budget fanfic production on YouTube or something.But sadly, this obscenity had a budget of... hang on let me pull up Wikipedia... 190 million dollars.Wow. That is just SAD.They LITERALLY replayed cut and pasted scenes from the original trilogy into this thing.WTF did these people do with that 190 million dollars???One of the few redeeming moments was NuSmith yelling ""MISTER ANDERSON""*sigh* My disappointment is disappointed.",5
915,"I admit that I was a little pumped when word got out that there was going to be a 4th Matrix movie after all of these years. I got my popcorn, grabbed a couple of sodas and sat down to watch. By the end of the film, the only emotional release I experienced was that of disappointment. It probably was a good idea at some point, but much like the 4th installment of a franchise with a certain fedora wearing, whip cracking archaeologist, I'm just going to keep the Matrix a trilogy in my mind, and pretend The Matrix Resurrections was just a bad dream.",4
916,"Looks like Lana Wachowski decided to take a backseat and let a fanboy take the entire movie. That's how the whole movie was. I cringed so hard at the self References that they make throughout the movie. Till this movie , I thought that Keanu and Carrie Ann Moss were the backbones of this movie but now , I realised that it is Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving who carried it. The action sequences were not fluid as in the first movie. Plot wise I felt that this was better than Revolutions but the making was so bland. Easily the worst movie in The Matrix franchise.",6
917,"I loved the first Matrix and even enjoyed two and three somewhat. I foolishly had high hopes for the fourth. To sum it up, if you really want to see a far inferior version of the first movie, this one will be for you.Everything about this movie is gross. I mean everything. It does not have one redeeming quality. It recycled everything from the previous movies, it's extremely pretentious, and every character harms the reputation of the original - even Neo himself.I've looked forward to this movie since its announcement, I am angry and disappointed with what I just watched, I'd give it a zero if the site let me.The movie asks you to believe that one cannot matter without the other - so shall it be with the Wachowskis.",1
918,"I must have watched the original 'The Matrix' over 100 times on VHS, it literally defined an era and pushed the boundaries of what action / sci-fi films could do. Fast forward 20+ years, and it's time to revisit the beloved franchise with 'The Matrix Resurrections'.Now to say I was disappointed by this film would be a huge understatement, I can't pinpoint it to one single fault with the film, rather lots of small ones making it an underwhelming experience.As the film heavily uses flashbacks to the original trilogy, I think it's only fair to use comparisons to the cinematography of the originals. They were stunning to look at, each scene iconic, action sequences that would stay with you for a lifetime, bullet time sequences that were mind blowing, I think you get the idea. This new edition doesn't have one single scene that blew me away, some mediocre actions scenes for sure, but nothing even close to the originals. Which will have you sometimes questioning are you even watching a Matrix movie? Also the CGI compared to other recent blockbusters doesn't seem up to scratch, with the inclusion of some cutesy CGI machines they've befriended looking ridiculously out of place.Onto the cast..Now losing Lawrence Fishburne, and Hugo weaving as Morpheus and Agent Smith is a major no no for me, the new actors are just massively miscast, not because they're bad actors, they do a great job, they just lack the intensity the original actors had, and it just feels wrong hearing ""Mr Anderson"" being said from anyone else. Also I didn't feel Neil Patrick Harris's roll as the main antagonist 'The Analyst' was sinister enough, In fact I just couldn't take him seriously.The sound track to the film didn't work in my opinion as well, the originals had that techno / grunge style going on which added no end to the whole tone and feel, this one hasn't anything like that until the end credits?I know it's a bit of a buzz word these days but the whole thing just felt like a really woke unnecessary addition to a beloved franchise.",4
919,"This movie is a joke. Felt like a stupid parody.The movie is so weak they trow in on every 30 sec a flashback of the orginal trilogy. Frustrating as hell. Almost everything is copy paste from the orginal. Due now that they try to use that as a story thing, but it's weak and has no identity. They treat the audience as dumb and this whole movie is a insult to a very epic trilogy. Iam not a hater or try to talk bad. But, damn..... Mediocre is now the standard combined with constant failure of remakes. Movie is really bad.",1
920,As a fan of the original trilogy and someone who enjoys the matrix films. This movie fell on its face. It is nothing but a love story with special effects and time wasting nonsense. The movie did not further the plot from where the third one left off. This is a film purely for nostalgia and to show you clips and snippets of the original trilogy to entice you to like a film that is not really good. Just a love story with time wasting fight Scenes.,3
921,"A complete waste of time. The entire movie is a bad joke that is a huge insult to us as the audience. There is no point, no plot, no interest. Half of the movie is a slideshow of shots from the previous 3 films. The best way to describe the film is to compare it to a high budget Youtube fan made remake of the Matrix. Don't waste your time or money.",1
922,"I'm a huge fan of the original Matrix which was a groundbreaking movie. I'm also a huge fan of Keanu, so I paid no attention to the bad reviews, went ahead and watched the movie. After all it's a Matrix. It's Keanu. It can't be THAT bad, right?Right?Well, it is that bad. It's boring. The script is chaotic, over complicated, you feel no compassion to the characters and no involvement with what's on the screen.For the first 10 minutes I tried my best to keep myself excited. ""Yeah, baby, we're back! Look, Keanu in front of a big ass computer! Using a vertical mouse!""But one hour in I found myself bored, distracted and feeling nothing.The only character with more-or-less charisma is the ""Bugs"" girl but that's about it.Shame.",3
923,"As ""The Matrix Resurrections"" (2021 release; 147 min.) opens, a woman named Bugs seems to have traced Trinity, who was long thought to be lost. As Bugs closes in, San Francisco cops are about to arrest Trinity, but she manages to escape, spectacularly of course. As does Bugs. Meanwhile, we meet up with Neo, now named Thomas Anderson and being a famous gaming developer, using his dreams of the Matrix as a base for these games. He also meets regularly with his shrink... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: upon the conclusion of the original Matrix trilogy in 2003, the Wachowskis famously declared they could not envision any further Matrix movies. What exactly it is that tempted Lana (erstwhile Larry) Wachowski to reconsider after all these years is not clear to me, but as a fan of the original trilogy (even with the 3rd film substantially below par), I couldn't help but be excited about a new installment. Having seen it now, I'm sorry to report that this is a mixed bag at best. The movie struggles to find an overall theme that would've necessitated a 4th Matrix film. Initially, we (and the characters) struggle to figure out what is real and what is fantasy. I mean it gets so confusing that the Keanu Reeves character keeps commenting, as much to himself as he does to the audience, ""assuming this is real"", and then ""this is not the real world!"". Yes, the script goes down a rabbit hole so deep that it doesn't know anymore which side is up or down. A different overall theme becomes clearer in the movie's second half, and that, combined with some truly spectacular action scenes, make for a better experience (by a mile or two) as opposed to the first half. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprise their roles from the original trilogy. Neil Patrick Harris has fun playing the ""baddie"". Christina Ricci has a small (less than 5 min.) role. But in the end, everyone is secondary to the action and fight scenes as well as the overall production set. The running time of 2 1/2 hrs is a bit misleading as the closing credits literally run for 12 min., and yes, you'll want to see through all of it as there is a surprise at the very end of them...""The Matrix Resurrections"" opened in theaters yesterday and also started streaming on HBO Max, where I caught it. While the movie is too long and too clever for its own good, the bottom line is that I could've chosen to stop watching at any time, but I didn't... Or perhaps, as one of the characters comments in the movie: ""The choice is an illusion"", and I didn't have a choice at all! If you liked the original Matrix trilogy, this 4th installment is obviously for you, but I'd suggest you approach this with limited expectations.",6
924,"It's very hard .... Actually it's imposible for me to find my words after witnesing such a travesty.I couldn't even go through to the end of it. I had to stop it after one hour and a 20 minutes, almost ...This is not the Matrix.This is not a sequel to the MatrixWatch the first 3 films and now that it's concludes the storyStay away from this regurgitation .........",1
925,"The Matrix is a watershed film which redefined the idea of action, introduced audiences to concepts of greater curiosity and understanding, and launched the careers of the Wachowskis, as it was the next film after their impressive debut, Bound. The scope and audacious technique of the film is still breathtaking today; it is not a film a newcomer watches, but experiences.Unfortunately, nearly every other media property which has sprung from The Matrix's well has been convoluted and uninspiring, including The Matrix Resurrections. Resurrections is a cash-grab, a desperate attempt by Warner Brothers to capitalize on stale IP which has already been squeezed for all the juice it's worth.The film follows Thomas Anderson, or Neo, as he learns, again, that his reality is not what it seems. He must follow a new cast of young, beautiful characters as they lead him out of the Matrix. Neo also enacts a rescue mission to extract Trinity from the heart of the machine city with a little help from his friends. It's an elliptical structure, similar to Mad Max: Fury Road, though Resurrections doesn't boast a tenth of the engagement, kinetics, or practical wizardry as that film. Also featured are cumbersome, infuriatingly frequent, and staggeringly lazy flashbacks to the original.Every element of The Matrix Resurrections feels tired and belabored, but the cardinal sin of the film is its action sequences. The Matrix is action. Aside from some brief philosophical quandaries, the franchise is most known for highly complex, frenetic, large-scale action set pieces. Even opponents of the later two films usually admit they're spectacle is beyond reproach. Not so for Resurrections.The action here is choppy, uninspired, incoherent, and just so small. It is, at best, comparable to an MCU film, which is in no way a compliment. There is one sequence in which the scope feels up to Matrix standards that involves people launching themselves like human missiles from buildings, but even this feels like a watered-down version of the ""the cars have been hacked!"" scene from The Fate of the Furious. Never would I have guessed that the most inspired action sequence in a Matrix film would be taken from such a perennially blockheaded franchise.The script begins intriguingly enough, introducing splashes of psychological questioning and mystery, but these are instantly evaporated once Neo is pulled from the Matrix. Once he's back in Zion, now called Io, all pretenses of screenwriting trickery are tossed aside for a blunt, sluggish action film. The inside of The Matrix has always been more interesting than the outside, and this proves doubly true in Resurrections. Most grating, the film name-drops Warner Bros. And calls out its callous, insatiable greed and creative bankruptcy. The Matrix Resurrections fights valiantly against its own construction in real time.Two side notes: First, there are machines on the side of humanity, cute little machines that look like manta ays. This is wildly contradictory from the established world of the trilogy. Secondly, and more importantly, Resurrections asserts that Neo has always needed Trinity to function as ""the glitch of the Matrix;"" not a bad concept, but it is a revisionist slap in the face to the Neo of old. Neo's source of divine power never came from a second entity. That's why they called him The One.The performances are a mixed bag; Carrie-Anne Moss gives a solid effort, which makes her the most engaging by default. Neil Patrick Harris is serviceable but never menacing. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Jonathan Groff are fine, but it's staggering arrogance to think Lawrence Fishburne or Hugo Weaving can be replaced.Weaving's absence is especially glaring; his agent Smith is, without exaggeration, iconic. No actor could hope to match his chilling, robotic verve, and casting such a young, handsome California-type like Groff is an obvious miscalculation. Not to disparage Groff, but he is a limp, corporatized substitute for Weaving. Keanu Reeves is simply awful. Granted, a Reeves performance is always a crapshoot, but he looks miserable, confused, and bored in equal turns here. Even by his shaky standards, this is unacceptably horrendous.Shoutout to Bill Pope, the cinematographer of the original trilogy. His murky green palette of the original was queasy but unique and gives those films an uncanny visual quality. His work won't be taken for granted after viewing Resurrections, which is supersaturated and distractingly garish. It almost looks like shudder a Netflix Original, though not as flat or monotonous.The world of the film has been made just as bland as the cinematography. There is a specific, grungy, steampunk style and atmosphere to the original. Admittedly, that style slowly receded through the rest of the trilogy, but Resurrections doesn't begin to feel like a Matrix film. It has the same sterilized, urban qualities as any other common blockbuster, like a Fast and Furious or MCU film. These franchises have already been invoked in this review, but there's a sameness to their world as to the Matrix's - a standardized cityscape, a depressing homogeny. In short, nothing about The Matrix Resurrections feels like a Matrix film.The Matrix Resurrections is a cash-grab. It's really that simple, and obviously so. It's worth discussing with friends for ten, maybe fifteen minutes before it falls into the memory abyss. It's a contemptable corporate package, one which tries to deflect from this fact by calling itself out. But acknowledgement of lazy, bland corporatism is not the same thing as divergence from lazy, bland corporatism. The film is a waste of time and money, and represents another pilfered fantasy, ground down and squeezed dry by the now-soulless dream factory. Stay far away.",4
926,The movie had everything that needs to make a great movie. Blue hair female lead. Huge diverse cast even from metaverse and machines (they really didnt put anyone out) and even rage against the machine with woke version.Maybe they should be more diverse on the follow up movie or more more woke parts. I felt a bit offended that the main matrix programs were male castand if you take this review in the wrong way maybe you are the reason that movie went wrong.,
927,"Despite the fact I often had little to no idea what was going on with this film, I loved it.There's just something about The Matrix, the whole world and universe that is so incredibly creative, thought provoking and awe inspiring, and I felt all of that returning to this fourth instalment.What I loved about the original films (yes, all of them), was the deep science fiction mixed with a compelling love story, political and social commentary and incredible action sequences.Did we get all of that with this film? To an extent.The action sequences pale in comparison to the highs of the earlier films, although there are some very cool moments. The story is also perhaps a little looser, but the rest is all there.I loved all of the meta references and on the whole I thought the plot was solid, really doubling down on the love story to great effect.There's a lot unwarranted hate out there for this film and I'm not sure why. In truth it is probably the weakest of the franchise, but is still very solid and it gives us a chance to return to the glorious world of the Matrix which I am all for.",8
928,"Solid start, meta and cool take of the Matrix itself in the movie. Sadly lost me in the second act.Best part about it is definitely Neil Patrick Harris, the only one that feels like he's really trying to do something in this movie, the rest come across like there not trying too much.The action scenes are not that good at all, Neo has a boring and uninteresting new power that makes things less visual and cool.Overall won't recommend unless ur a huge fan of Matrix😕",5
929,"Honestly, this film provided me with a much needed nap. The next day I did go back and watch the second half. Honestly, though, the nap was better. They could have done so much more, but instead turned out something that only diminishes the last vestige of novelty the original film offered.",3
930,"Because they want to change the world and they cannot make new characters to be loved by people, they kill, transform the old and loved characters. They killed 007, they killed James T Kirk, they killed Neo. Following Riggs, McLane, Ethan.They destroyed Matrix. A forgotten movie the day which followed.New was weak, Trinity new Neo.Pathetic. Rest In Peace.",1
931,"First of all I'd like to mention that I was very excited to hear about new matrix, and was looking forward to watching it. I love the trilogy. With a heavy heart I walked out of the theater on this one.Creating a new part for something as good as the matrix is a risk (expectations are high, and most of the story is told) but I assumed they had plenty of time to think of something and will make a killer film. Boy was I wrong! They butchered the crap out of it. They highlight the fact that time past yet, nothing changed, nothing new brought to the table. Characters look like they fell out of year 2000 and it could have been okay, if it wasnt made so cliché and parody like. In the matrix 4 you are rewatching same story, they even copied some scenes exactly. Also good 20 % of this film is straight up pieces of the original Matrix. It feels like a parody of itself. And they let you know it from the beginning, setting a viewer into having to choose whether they like or hate the film withing the first minutes of it's beginning. You can see what most viewers thought about this introduction of new matrix. Also with the the original movie scenes in this one, it feels like a message "" we didn't know what to do here so here is the piece of something you all like""Quote from an interview :""Lana'sdesire to bring Neo and Trinity Carrie-Anne Moss together again, and the feeling that it could be good medicine for her, for the story, and, potentially, for the audience,"" the star continued. So here you have it, the audience is the last in this list ""with potentially they will enjoy it"" sort of mentality, that's how this poor soap opera cheese ball was created.Mockery of the original movie and total grab for money.DONT spend your money on it, you will regret it! Better yet don't watch it even if it's free.",1
932,I just can't understand why this movie was made into this version.I waited so very long for Neo to return but not like this.Movie feels wayward. Had so much potential but why the wachowski did not put much needed effort in furthering the one of the most amazing franchise of all times.Like i said WAYWARD.,6
933,Despite the bad reviews I was still looking forward to watching this.Unfortunately I have nothing positive to say..It's so bad..The original cast that appeared in this must regret it once they viewed it.What on earth were they thinking?Pretend this doesn't exist and just remember the trilogy.,1
934,"I still can't believe this was a Matrix movie. It felt more like a parody, a bad imitation of the original movie rather than a sequel. The two new villains are just not relatable and seem so bland with no character. The action makes no sense, and the dialogs feel so forced. Really really really disappointed.",2
935,The only thing this movie brings to the table is the idea that love is the most powerful force in the matrix... Which is just stupid.This movie Sofia not have been made.,3
936,"This was an absolute waste of an opportunity. This didn't even hit the mark for nostalgic value. This is in the same basket as Independence Day 2 where they had about 2 decades to get it done right, but ended up putting out a trash movie that seems to have had zero thought out into it. I was so excited for this and ended up being almost the most disappointed I've ever been.",1
937,It was like watching one of those cheap TV shows on the Syfy channel. A bad version of Sense 8. They pick the wrong people to replace beloved characters.,5
938,"Such a wasted opportunity! I really wanted to like this film but everything is wrong, messy action scenes, bad script, changes to the original story (since when did Trinity have any bearing on Neo's powers). The biggest issue though, is the whole look and feel of the film is off, it just looks like a cheap budget movie and is made worse by the substitutes for Morpheus and Agent Smith.",4
939,The audio was horrible. Could not understand half of what was said which made it impossible to follow. A whole lot of nothing going on. Unlikable characters. And then I fell asleep. Don't waste your time.,1
940,"This movie is a total garbage and does not make any sense. This should have never been made. Do not watch it, totally ruined the Matrix franchisee. Save your time and do not watch it. I am not even sure how it was approved to be produced lol. It started to get bored within 10 mins into movie.",1
941,"A terrible movie. Watched the original triology before this for the first time (an amazing experience). However, this movie is very bad. Extremely lazy script, crappy new characters, and nonexisting plot. Do yourself a favor and completely skip this movie and watch the original triology instead.",3
942,"First of all i do want to mention what the good things are1. Keanu and Carrie-Anne can certainly still carry this franchise with the right script (unfortunately this is not it), and also Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Jessica Henwick does solid performances with what they are given.I cannot think of anything more positive to say about this movie.What made the first movie great, and the sequels watchable, was pure originality and amazing characters fighting for an epic goal. All of this is lacking in this movie. The movie is constantly duplicating scenes from the first movie, to no other end then to try to capture some feelings of nostalgia. The result is that you keep remembering what utter nonsense this is in comparison to the original. The amount of flashbacks and reused material is just ridiculous, and Naruto and One piece now have stiff competition in this area.The pace is also quite unexplainable as scenes that could (and definitely should) be kept to a minute or two just keeps dragging on (yes i'm thinking of the horrible game design scene). And other scenes that could use some more explanation are cut short.The secondary cast is a poor replica of the original crew, and are not given any opportunity to stand out (or even act). The ones that are given some space and screen time as Jonathan Groff as Smith that presents a character that bears no resemblance at all to the original. His lack of any kind of charisma is almost impressive. Neil Patrick Harris is being his usual self and feels very out of place.The action scenes are either scenes that we have seen before in the series, duplicated, or things done better in other movies.The greatest pain point of the movie might still be that the makers of this nonsense have chosen a script that try to spin the story completely around the old main characters, and really have to force things to make it fit this narrative. The obvious choice would instead be to introduce a new protagonist and focus the story around them, weaving in the new cast and the more known characters in a natural way.Now we end up with a copy of a movie without any apparent goal, with bleak characters that you don't care for, doing repetitive things to no end.2 out of 10, and that is generous.",2
943,"I'm a fan of the franchise, and I sat in the cinema full of anticipation.Unfortunately, it is a shocking rehash and most definitely the worst one of the lot. The storyline is poor and none of the supporting characters were really likeable.Not enough Agents either for my liking.I'm not exaggerating when I say people walked out of the cinema.Such a shame, please don't make another one.",3
944,2.5 hours for literally nothing. The storyline could have been covered in 30 min instead of hours. Loved the trilogy but I just don't see the point of this.,3
945,"Seriously, this must be a joke. It's so bad I don't no what to say. It's the worst thing I've seen since Halloween 3 season of the witch and old my god was that bad. Don't waste your time on this shot it's just gonna make you sad.",1
946,"This should have been called MATRIX: BADLY REHASED! Where do l start with a review of something so poor! I'll start with ""lazy"" ""lacklustre"" ""missed the target"" and ""what happened to the soul of the original's""Rather than try and make an actual decent film, they cobbled together bits of a story with flashbacks to the originals and used old characters in a pointless way. Keanu actually looked like he wasn't interested. Carrie Anne was just treading water, badly! Jada Pinket, her character was appalling. And as for the marovingian, if he was so all powerful in the original's, how come he looks like the trainmans tranpier brother!What a mess!!",4
947,"As a filmmaker and avid fan of the original three Matrix movies by the Wachowski siblings, The Matrix Resurrections (2021) is honestly everything I suspected it might be. Flavorless.A Matrix lacking the zest, powerful imagery, passion and energy of the original trilogy. The dialogue drab and boring, the acting subpar, and much like 2020 and 2021, pretty much plain disappointing.One may ask why, go ahead ask! Oh, no! My writing right now sounds like dialogue from this movie...I suspected Resurrections would probably lack all of the things that made the original Trilogy successful, once I heard only one of the Wachowski's were writing and directing it. To be successful, it really needed to have the creative conflict, tension and challenge that could only happen in a co-writing partnership that the original movies possessed. Challenging each other on ideas, pushing each other to reach further and go farther creatively, that is what the first three movies had in their story and directing that this new release lacks.In filmmaking, the theory goes, the first fifteen minutes of a movie and the last fifteen, are what makes or breaks a movie, and Resurrections doesn't have the magic. The first fifteen minutes are full of rushed, drab dialogue that fails to pull the audience into the story. If the two Wachowski siblings had wrote it together, I imagine it would have been more thoroughly weaved together in a thoughtful way. Instead, the story pace is off.Instead of developing the Character backstories for this new sequel, which introduces new characters, replacement characters; Resurrections uses clips from the original movies in mundane and non-creative ways to attempt to fill in the history.The ""bump points"", are really flat. Bump points are places within a script created to move the story forward, help increase the rising tension and conflict, and ultimately push the final resolution of the story.The Matrix Resurrections (2021) feels very pieced together, instead of having fluidity. Reminds me of The Adjustment Bureau (2011). In the The Adjustment Bureau you have Matt Damon being chased continuously through a series of ""backdoors"". I imagine the The Adjustment Bureau doors concept stemmed at least in part from the original Matrix movie, it worked pretty well for the The Adjustment Bureau, and the original Matrix series, but in this new Matrix movie, it just feels like a messy method to pull along the story, without really developing anything new or original.The new unrelated characters reusing lines from the past sequels characters feels forced. It was probably an attempt to try to make those watching the movie feel a bit, ""De Ja Vu"", but it didn't work as intended. The dialogue is often rushed and unauthentic.I took a short break while writing this review to summarize my thoughts, it dawned on me that The Matrix Resurrections (2021) felt very much like a movie project I was involved with in 2013. At the time I was working on Aurora's pilot. A pilot film to movies is what a demo is to music. You create a pilot of a movie to help sell the idea of the feature movie you want to make. It is essentially a short story covering key aspects of the movie plot. Pilots are generally low budget, using less experienced cast and crews. That is what The Matrix Resurrections (2021) feels like. It feels like a pilot that would be made before even the first Matrix would be authorized for production.",4
948,"It has been a looong time since a movie dropped the ball this hard. Seemingly easy things like not having shakey camera fights or a basic narrative storyline with some identified antagonist before the second half of the movie.This failed in every category of film making and should be further used as an example of what zero motivated production results in.Failures of everything from fight choreography to basic vfx mistakes, the writing is just a bizarre combination of forced winks to the previous movies and jabs at the studio forcing them to make the film.",2
949,This movie obviously only served the purpose of Lana Wachowski indulging in ridiculous story telling and as a cash grab from a once popular franchise. There's parts of this movie that makes absolutely no sense and other parts that are absolutely cringe worthy. Surprised this actually got made. And the plot of the movie is just all over the place and really doesn't establish anything different.,3
950,"As someone who grew up watching the old Matrix movies, this movie will definitely demolish the reputation of the first one especially. Everything about this movie is slow paced, cliché, and cheesy. The action scenes and special effects were terrible. Our lead, Keanu Reeves was not the amazing badass Neo in the last three movies we had all been entranced with. Instead he literally looked like he was going through a mid life crisis and he has no idea what he is doing. And strangely enough, Carrie Anne Moss does not appear on screen as Trinity as often as I thought she would. Which is a shame. Overall the entire screenplay was incredibly poorly written, the directing mediocre at best (what happened to the classic fight scenes and revolutionary cinematics of the first two Matrix movies?) and the story line was so needlessly complex not even the writers knew what the hell they were doing. If you love yourself and you don't want to ruin your concept of the Matrix, please don't watch this movie. Just don't do it. Save yourself time and money. Don't even bother trying to figure out the plot because there is nothing special, you'll only end up disappointing yourself more. This entire movie should not have been made in the first place, there was absolutely no need for this. The Matrix's iconic legacy has been tarnished by this cash grab of a film.",1
951,"I don't know where to begin? All I can say I was left gutted when I witnessed another great saga being destroyed.In summary, lazy plot, bad direction, laughable acting, yawning fight scenes, bad CGI and background music. EVERYTHING about this movie was bad.1. All 'resurrected' actors now look like a bunch of aspirin gobbler geriatrics, forcing themselves to do fight scenes.2. No originality. Failure remakes of fight scenes from old ones, e.g. Neo vs Morpheus fight scene. Except, the original fight scene 22 years ago was still far superior technically, which was appropriate to the plot and it managed to bring adrenaline. Original Matrix fight scenes and stunts were something 'NEW', which no one had seen before. Even after 20 years, the remake scenes are the same or worse.3. Merovingian was brought back for what? I literally laughed at his bad acting. Morpheus seemed a recent college grad demanding safe space. Agent Smith was so ordinary, it was difficult to recall his face after 10 mins. None of the characters had the personality or substance they were supposed to have.4. Wokism was the final nail in the coffin. How difficult it is not to lecture people? I watch movies for entertainment, not for woke lectures. As part of the woke check list, inclusivity, multiculturalism, devaluing men, powerful women in every key positions, and in the end superwoman Trinity and a clown Neo was shown. All boxes checked. Good job!This is the first time I would recommend take the blue pill and remain with old happy memories of this saga. The new red pill will give you grief, anger, frustration, insanity, insomnia, heart attack and maybe cancer. You have been warned.",1
952,"Nice effects and all, but good forbid the script. Is it made of backstage movie writers? Why the hell do we want to relive all the scenes from the past?",4
953,"The agents are now the equivalent of storm troopers who fire 1000 rounds but can't hit a blue haired girl doing a backflip in an empty hallway. The word binary is used 372 times in the first ten minutes to remind us that life is not binary. We get to enjoy a corporate meeting where everyone bashes capitalism and the white guy is a doofus, as usual. And this is all just in the first 25 minutes.Sound familiar yet? Getting that feeling of deja vu? No, you're not in the matrix, you're just watching another fantastic film franchise ruined by the usual Hollywood political agenda.",3
954,"First 3 movies were like 5 star breakfast, lunch and dinner. This one was like a cheap snack, Completely ruined ""the matrix"" what a shame. Some shots were cool though.",3
955,"Watching The Matrix Resurrections is like watching an old friend's new cover band perform your favorite songs at a local dive bar and they... did their best.Generally, I'm pretty forgiving of bad movies and bad shows. I'm someone who enjoyed Picard, Transformers, and Army of the Dead. While my cinephile friends will get a good laugh from the kind of stuff that I'm willing to call good, I stand by my conviction to just seek a good time with cinema, even if I don't come out of every experience with my life changed.So, if I dislike a movie as much as I disliked Resurrections, I see red flags start to fly in my friends' minds about the quality of it immediately.I was generally looking forward to The Matrix Resurrections. Everyone, including me, loves The Matrix. And even if its two sequels didn't reach the same heights of the original classic, they were still interesting and thought-provoking sci-fi action movies with deep worldbuilding.But the fourth film, The Matrix Resurrections, is a disaster of a movie filled with meta nonsense and half-baked ideas. If it hadn't been made by Lana Wachowski, I probably would have already mentally deleted this story from the lore and chalked it up to misguided fan-fiction.Legend has it that Wachowski didn't want to continue the franchise, but she was getting pressure and constant threats from the studio that another director would be found to reboot The Matrix if she didn't return.It makes me think that Lana Wachowski made The Matrix Resurrections as a direct stab at Warner Brothers and their insistence on ruining the franchise in an all-too-common chase for the capitalization of nostalgia.They all but confirmed this theory in one of the film's painfully awkward dialogue scenes.And, you know, I kind of respect that sentiment from Wachowski. I even respect using that same threatened IP to throw the middle finger up to your corporate overlords.The problem with this epic-level troll of a concept is that Wachowski also threw that finger at both the fans of The Matrix and the IP itself.While you'll find a few interesting ideas and story continuations in Resurrections, mostly you'll get a bitter attempt at throwing shade at everyone who came to force this unnecessary fourth installment into existence.Sadly, the interesting moments of worldbuilding that do manage to sneak their way into the movie are token gestures at best, and mind-blowingly stupid story decisions at worst.And it's not that Resurrections doesn't have any good ideas, because it does. It's that the film isn't really willing to explore them to any satisfactory level. Instead, the film treads tired-waters and wallows in the misery of its own existence.You might say, ""But wait! Neo and Trinity are back! That's cool, right?!""Sure, in a way. Their chemistry is still good here. And they are a warm blanket on a cold day when they share the screen together. It just makes you comfortable and content seeing these two icons again.However, if you are expecting at least some decent Kung Fu or unique action set-pieces, then you should temper your expectations right now.The action in Matrix 4 is subpar at best, and laughable at worse, sans a 5-minute segment in the closing minutes of the final act. And even that sequence was just visually average for a 2021 big-budget film.As someone who has watched an unspeakable amount of martial arts films with paper-thin plots, I can say that the fights in Resurrections are really bad. A particular scene with Neo that was supposed to dose you with heavy nostalgia ends up being hilariously choreographed to the point where there are inches of space between punches and slow, wide swings that make no sense in context.The original choreography team is sorely missed in a film that needed them this much.All of this makes for a movie that just can't manage to justify its own existence, and that's a shame. Because even if the Wachowskis don't think there are more good Matrix stories to be told, there are potentially tens of millions of fans just like me who think that there are still lots of great opportunities for interesting stories within this complicated and beloved lore.I never thought that I would say this, but maybe it is actually time that someone else try their hand at this franchise, since it's obvious that WB is going to try to bring it back.4/10. This was my biggest cinematic disappointment of 2021.",4
956,"Man this movie was sooooo bad, it's a Christmas tree movie, just green , missing the red.They miss the mark, and even in the movie they had to do a documentary, like really?Ok!",3
957,"This is a complete insult to the original trilogy. The original movies was full of detail and storyline, the new one felt rushed, underdeveloped and not very well thought through.",2
958,"Very bad...Does no one know how to make a movie these days? I've just finished watching it and I don't think I can even remember half of it because... it has no plot. It's a whole lot of nothing.There was a line in it where they basically said ""we need to find something as iconic as bullet time"" and then they went on to find absolutely nothing.It's a sad pathetic lazy rushed money grab of a movie that will instantly be forgotten as just a terrible sequel.",1
959,It was the worst movie I have ever seen.If you have unneeded excessive time of your life just watch it.I paid in the cinema money and my time to sit and enjoy it however it was misunderstood not clear and till now I didn't get it. I couldn't complete it till the end. 30 min then I left.,1
960,"I don't know who hired what or how much money was paid but there's no way this movie stays in the 6 ratings. It's terrible. It's so terrible they couldn't even get Morpheus or Smith to come back so they had to replace the actors. You would think if two of your main characters refuse a script, maybe you just shouldn't make the movie. Maybe it should stop you from making something that's absolute garbage. I'm enjoying watching the rating fall now that whatever pumpers were hired to artificially manipulate the rating so high to begin with are being outweighed by actual people who watched the movie.Save your money and better yet , save your time. Watch -anything- else.",1
961,"I was a bit confused at first, but be patient, it all sorts itself out and then it is nothing short of fantastic. The action scenes, the effects, and of course Reeves and Moss. They brought the chemistry and the bad ass - ness. The vibe was unmatched.",8
962,"We were excited to watch a masterpiece that the film industry is proud of, but unfortunately the filming does not even amount to a family series because of the lack of use of artificial intelligence techniques that were used in the nineties that made the film a masterpiece. And the wonderful performance and elegant characters that were long ago, but now we see how the film is spoiled from all creative aspects.",1
963,"Matrix four definitively proves that anything a man can do, a woman can utterly destroy (even if they are the same person). Pretty sure the entire premise of this is to reboot matrix 1 but shoot it all in slow-mo, with horrible effects, dialogue, and acting. Shame on Keanu and Carrie for even doing this trash.",1
964,"They step in it with the original Matrix and it's been downhill ever since. New filming techniques made the original and zero talent in any other areas of film making were exposed on the subsequent films and other films. Shocking (not really) that a film this poor could get made. Obviously the Wachowski are not people who have a firm grip on reality. In a way this is a fitting end, self deluded peope living a fabricated reality and looking ridiculous while doing it. Art imitates life.",2
965,"God this was hard to watch! From minute 5 I was pissed. The slow motions and the miss rate of the shootings passed star wars, even the force use, too much, too many scenes from the previous movie, the dialogs were vere constipated, slow became hard to wait for them to talk. I had a few quotes picked up from the decent dialogs but, too bad, the cast didn't deserve this. I'm sorry for the people who paid to watch this and endure on cinema. Stop making unnecessary reboots! WB is beaming Marvel, faster and faster.",5
966,"Yeah, saw Matrix 4, unfortunately. Smacked of someone wanting to be a director, and the Bros had some money left over, not enough to attempt such a title, but hey, they think slow people won't notice, I guess. Only thing accurate was all the millennials shopping ideas (bounce that bae...) in their WOKE, disconnected confused additive to thinking they're doing it; made the room. Is how is in writing rooms and they think their convoluted agenda must just be what everyone wants (there's even companies can hire that will do Millennial Voice Over work). No wonder the insanity continues.",3
967,"Mediocre acting, bad storyline and horrible fighting scenes. It was like no one was even making an effort. Neo looked like on drugs. Can't even talk. It was like something is in his throat. Or like speaking in bass in his voice.",3
968,"I loved ""The Matrix"" 1999 so I gave this a chance. My hopes were not high after ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"". No need for Matrix 4, WB was trying to cash some extra money on this ""not needed"" sequel.",2
969,"This movie not only made me feel old, but also opens my eyes to just how screwed we are as a species. Whatever used to make us unique, call it love, passion or whatever you want. It's leaving us slowly but surely the further we move away from each other. If this is a sign of where things are going then we are closer to the end than I ever thought. I wish I could turn back time to when it all still felt real. Life now is as sad as this film.",1
970,Could have been a whole lot better if the characters were same. The movie plot is very slow with people left yawning at times including me. Also the action part as compared to other parts is really very less which makes me very disappointed considering the Trilogy which I have watched more than a hundred times.,4

972,"I'm confused. What's the point with this movie?Don't get me wrong, I was happy to see Neo and Trinity again and the first 30-ish minutes was very, very interesting. But, there are two hours left. Two hours of boooring mess! Nothing really new and iconic, nothing big and mind blowing. OK, there is no rubber Neo, this time they got him right. Action? We saw all of it in 1, 2 and 3, maybe some new yoga style shooting guns. Story? We have 10-15 minutes of flashback scenes from 1, 2 and 3, so...no, no story in number 4.So, why does this movie exists?Well, Lana Wachowsky said that shehad lost her parents and couldn't deal with that, so she brought back to life Neo and Trinity, two most important (fictional) characters in her life... That's it. The only reason. They have to be alive again and nothing else matters. Nothing else matters... Wrong reason to make a movie.",5
973,"Truly bad script not saved by a rehash of the overuse of previous worn out CGI special effects. Became boring about 20 minutes in and never recovered. There was absolutely no reason why this movie, or any of the increasing bad sequel Matrix movies, ever should have been made. Three stars only because I've seen worse.",2
974,"Even though I absolutely loved The Matrix when it first came out, The Matrix Reloaded kind of drained it out of me and I've not really been that into it since. Only just rewatched the original trilogy some time earlier this year/last year to come to the realization that Reloaded was utter garbage but Revolutions was a whole lot better than I remembered, possibly because of Reloaded tainting it.So when I heard about this one, I had no strong feelings one way or the other. I saw the trailer and it stressed me out a little but ultimately I didn't care enough to get emotionally invested one way or another. I went into the film fully ready to either like it, hate it, or think it was okay, and figure people would have their reasons to dislike it or not and have the reasonings be on a long-winded chart ranging from deep philosophical and technical justifications to the more simplistic, yet more profound reasonings of ""I like movie is fun""Whatever it was or however it was meant to be, I ended up deeply liking and finding myself resonating with this film a lot more than I expected.Right from the start the film it starts toying with itself, going meta on multiple levels, from new characters in a ""modal"" watching events from the original The Matrix being re-played with different actors, to Thomas Anderson presumably in the new matrix being a video game developer of a video game called ""The Matrix"" existing within this presumable new matrix.I was greatly entertained and drawn in by the conflict Thomas Anderson has, one which seems to go into a third sort of meta as to the seeming real life mental conditions of people who are convinced the ""Matrix"" is real and they are trapped in it.Thomas Anderson's life has become a mundane routine that is both comfortable and frustrating, and based on his therapy sessions with Neil Patrick Harris's unnamed therapist character, this situation has come off a serious mental episode and suicide attempt by Anderson in which he was unable to determine whether the events of ""The Matrix The Video Game"" in-universe were based on dreams or memories, and thus tried to fly off a building.While it seems to get mealy-mouthed and wordy about it, it's incredibly difficult to convey the sort of solipsistic trauma and perpetual uncertainty as to what is real in a way that is at both keeping with the themes of the original ""Matrix"" while also being new.I'm reminded of a meme of all things, comparing the classic novels ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"", claiming that ""back in the day"", it was the greatest fear of sci-fi dramas that the world would turn out like ""1984"", with a strict authoritarianism fixated on suppression of facts, truth, and reality and of replacing it with fiction, whereas what actually happened to the world was more like ""Brave New World"", with facts truth and reality not being suppressed by a central power, but drowned out by a flood of competing lies and propaganda meant to distract and disillusion.One of ""The Matrix Revolutions"" themes goes in on this as a concept; rather than trying to ""re-plug"" Neo into the Matrix and erase his past life, he's plugged back in and has his past life thrust in his face at all times, only altered in such a way as to make him question whether it was ever real.The rather fast pace of the film makes it so this theme is itself almost drowned out by a flood of other competing themes, and I can understand how that can turn many people off with the sentiment of many ideas being half-baked, or convoluted and unfocused. And it is unfocused to a degree. To give more focus to one theme over another would drastically change the film, and to give focus to every theme would turn it into a miniseries.But this theme of reality as a dream is given the most immediate attention and takes up most of the first 20 minutes or so. The fact that it isn't directly picked back up later on means that at any given point in the events that follow, it could still entirely be possible that ""The Matrix The Video Game"" is real, that ""The Matrix"" is not real, and that Thomas Anderson has gone off his meds and is now trapped in his own fictional world, much like the original intended ending for 1990's ""Total Recall"".Beyond that, there's plenty of fun stuff to be had, cringeworthy elements, as well as rehashes that feel like rehashes, rehashes that feel somewhat unique and new, and a lot of fun to be had in the ""Real World"" indicating that even with the ""return"" to the matrix, Neo and Trinity's actions from the original trilogy did have a clear and lasting effect.",8
975,"I wanted to like this film, as I'm a HUGE fan of the other Matrix films. This was just a mess from start to finish. The user ""ecsecs-91225"" summed it up quite nicely.This is probably the last time I'll be visiting the movies as a whole. Hollywood have now proven beyond an absolute doubt that they can no longer make movies.",1
976,"There was NOTHING about this film that brought anything positive to the Matrix universe, instead, it stands alone as a parody in so many ways. Fun if you don't care about the original trilogy; painful if you do.",1

Even in the movie is a reference to this WB issue.You can tell Keanu just don't care anynore it's just a compromise to Lana at this ponit.",4
978,"The new Morpheus was horribleThe new agent smith was horribleThe storyline was horribleThe fight scenes were horrible, the choreography, the angles, the camerawork. All of it horrible. In the original you could see everything happening in the fights. Here you get a close up of everyone's face while they fight. Barely able to focus on the actual fight moves.",1
979,"Starts well with some overt meta-observations of the Hollywood machine's tendency / necessity to make sequels no-one wants. That lasts maybe 20 minutes, after which it abandons any such audacity or self-aware capitalist commentary and descends into a reheated, deflated blancmange of remixed moments from the earlier three films. Sure, it looks cool, but there's absolutely nothing new on offer and it only succeeds in making everyone involved look foolish. Neil Patrick Harris is a terrible villain, too. This doesn't diminish the original film's status as a classic, but what a shame it wasn't suprising in any way and just proved the point the first few scenes make.",4
980,"I am not surprised that the 4th Matrix movie is bad but I am surprised at how much of a dumpster fire it is AND that this actually ever got madd - they seriously could not see thay this was a stillborn idea?The idea that a new Matrix has risen is fair enough and that a new Architect would rise that couls do it better - but trying to resurrect the effoet of Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving usibg actors who has not an ounce of their charisma and style, that was doomed to fail.That and the fact that the story is quite dull ans mostly a rehash of previous movies when it comes to the action, well it juat quickly becomes something you should see on fast forward.",3
981,"Special effects, Love Interest, The chase, Rebuilds crappy world, The End! Everyone luvs an action driven movie with all the special bells &amp; whistles but let this be the final Act!",5
982,"The 1999 Matrix was a visual spectacle but every action scene, every fight, every chase was tied to the arc of not only the story but the characters. There wasn't a wasted moment. Resurrections on the other hand brings the spectacle but without moving characters forward.By the time the big finale comes around, every big choice has been made, every character has reached their conclusion. The obligatory CGI fest is nothing more than big action for the sake of it and fizzles out in an unexpected but incredibly poorly handled way.In Resurrections, Lana Wachowski makes the same mistake she and her sister made with Reloaded and Revolutions. She doubles down on the Neo and Trinity relationship, a relationship that was barely extant through most of the original, and one that is not remotely interesting enough to be the core of one movie, let alone three.The additions to the lore are interesting and have far reaching implications. However, as a movie...well it seems the Wachowski Sisters caught lightning in a bottle once and only once in regards to this franchise.",4
983,"It's a bit random but I compare any movie to taking a nice evening walk. A movie need not win in such a comparison but it ought to give you a run for your money.As everyone else is noting, The Matrix Resurrections feels like a very sad cash grab, one which feels like explaining to you why some key actors are missing. They break the 4th wall in the most ugly way, as if to say ""haha we know this is a bad movie but you know Warner Brothers forced our hand."" Literally. Right at the start of the film.",4
984,How else could all the sequels be so bad! The 1st matrix is incredible in every single way!2nd one was ok because of the action.3rd one had no story and terrible fight scenes in the rain (terrible choice for an epic final fight scene.)And this 4th one honestly you can just pretend didn't even get made. It's just call backs to how good the 1st movie is and constantly reminds you during the movie that this one shouldn't have been made.The directors change into females and all the sudden. Girl power!! Trinity is the New ONE! And she's flying while Neo can't! Lol I'm all for this women empowerment move. But come up with your own material! Stop taking movies and making terrible sequels that make no sense to the originals!Needless to say don't waste your time with this movie. You could spend 2 hours doing literally anything else and it would be more enjoyable then watching this.,1
985,"It's a 2 and a half hour long trailer without anything that made the trilogy cult classics, didn't expect much, got even less, horrible movie that relies to much on meta and nostalgia, and it was not needed.",5
986,"2 1/2 hours of god knows what, why did they bother, that's just my personal opinion, all these modern films and the 100's of millions spent on them and they're absolute rubbish i'd even go as far as to say I could've done better, the only thing that i can understand about the film is that now I know why some of the original cast weren't in it , they definitely "" dodged a bullet"" , the only person in it that peaked my interest was Neil patrick Harris.",1
987,"This is beyond garbage, why make something you know will be bad?They try to be ""meta"" but everything is just complete garbage so it just feels like a bad Matrix clone.I had to force my self from turning it off, luckily I didn't pay for this mistake.Why ruin your legacy?",1
988,"Most of this movie is about meeting the same people from the early movies, just with a lot of time spent on talking about it.There is not the same spark about this movie. No flair, nothing. Just 90 percentage of ""let me explain the old movies into this new one"".",4
989,"Matrix Resurrections has a promising start. Suggesting that there is a meta-level of reality above what we encountered in the previous movies offers intriguing opportunities for storytelling. How deep does the rabbit hole go?Unfortunately, this was not penned by Charlie Kaufman, so the story lists back towards familiar ground; shootouts and acrobatics in cool suits, interspersed with dreary exposition in claustrophobic settings.Io (the new Zion counterpart) is a dull intermission with little dramatic tension. Oh no, Neo has been arrested and sent to a cell, what will he -- oh wait, he's rescued literally 10 seconds later.Another problem is clarity in action sequences. Group shootouts and melee are chaotic, fog-of-war brawls where it is hard to tell who is who. Parkour scenes of the heroes running away have more impact because of the focus on one protagonist.Rather than being an average action romp, it could have really tapped into the zeitgeist and been so much more. In the age of Fake News, imagine a fractured Matrix where the global consensus and what is real is replaced by Truth-Is-What-I-Say-It-Is mindset of social media, and personal sub-realities battle for dominance. That is the movie I hoped for, rather than just a variation of the previous sequels.",5
990,"Wow what a colossal disappointment this movie was. I was really looking forward to it too. Absolutely nothing exciting or interesting about this piece of garbage, not a single cool scene or special effect, nothing. Bad acting, weak story. Should have never been made is was so bad trust me guys don't waste 2 1/2 hours of your life on this movie.",1
991,"As a fan of the matrix &amp; reloaded I was disappointed with revolution as the trilogy seemed to get lost in its own soup , this new instalment does nothing to rectify that , so let be clear and precise so there's no confusion , everything good about the original this movie isn't that this move is garbage , what for it to come in tv if you must see it but I assure to spend money on this is wrong, I'm so so SO disappointed I can't tell you how much.",1
992,"It is sad to see them dig up one of the biggest franchises in movies history after 22 years for a quick cash grab from nostalgic fans of the series, does not represent the Matrix or anything it stood for!",1
993,What if the movie had started with a person who helped the machines in exchange for the better life in the matrix but who reveals himself and wants to help Neo to take back the real world for humans.And the scene develops saving Trinity with the support also of the machines who want to help the humans and that unleashes the war for the humans to take back the world.This plot makes more sense.,4
994,"They had a great opportunity here to do something unique. The idea of Thomas Anderson still alive wondering if it was all just a crazy man's dream or if it had been real could have had some nice twists with him ultimately choosing the Matrix over the real world and left you wondering if his choice was correct. Similar to how they ended the original Total Recall. I would have loved that and it would have left an opening for a fifth installment.Like many movies today they over emphasized the action over some of the new characters leaving the movie to feel really rushed. Remember Mouser from the first installment? I felt like I knew him better than any of the new characters in this version including Morpheus. They really needed to build the characters personalities up a tad more.The fight sequences were no where near as exciting as the original or the two previous sequels. ""I remember Kung Fu"" as Neo states at one point but he chooses to use his newly acquired shields more than any Kung Fu. He uses them to stop punches, bullets, cannon fire from helicopters, blasts from massive explosions and more...? And all he has to do is hold his hands up. A good portion of the action is just him shielding himself and Trinity.Mr Smith actually got nice? What? He's on Neo and Trinity's side? Ugh!!! The Architect who actually had some really cool things to say about the Matrix was fascinating. He has now been replaced by Neil Patrick Harris's Analyst who's big secret to beating Neo and Trinity is to slow down time and give them hints of each other without allowing them to have love but in the end it's one of the Analyst's servants that introduces them breaking the spell and causing them to realize the truth.The explanation of how or even why Trinity and Neo are resurrected by the machines was truly lame.The outcasts that make a reappearance seems to just be to throw a bone to the original actors. I mean what purpose is the. I mean what was the whole purpose of the Frenchman (Merovingian). To continually yell nonsense about how angry he is for his life being disrupted then to just disappear?So many opportunities.So many wasted moments.So many irrelevant screens.Great actors wasted on action scenes.But it did don on me how the Wachowski bothers became Lana Wachowski and as such the Wachowski Sisters. Good for them. Wish they were as good of directors as women as they were as men. Not sure why Lilly didn't participate. It might have been better.Never the less, I gave it a 5, edging towards a 6. But there is no cutting edge film making here. Still, I recommend seeing it just so you know how the story went. Where next? I don't see a follow up in the making.",5
995,"Like a ruminant, the Warmer Bros studio chewed the story to a slop, and regurgitated it into Matrix Resurrections.There is absolutely nothing new in this story, just a mish-mash of elements from the first, and the best, Matrix movie. But like in a distorted mirror, these elements are reflecting back a monster, as they are haphazardly put together.I couldn't bear to watch more than half of this movie, even if I didn't pay anything extra streaming it on HBO.",
996,"This movie reminds me of Star Wars Episode 9: the Rise of Skywalker... it is possibly a franchise killer...The direction of the movie was ok but the ideas were wrong. Also, It has way too much unnecessary scenes from the previous movies.I really love the Matrix trilogy and I would like to see more movies in the future but this must be done with different director and not, unfortunately, with the Wachowskis.",5
997,"I guess the main reason why I didn't really liked it was the fact that Neo and &lt;Trinity were played by original cast but Morpheus and Smith wasn't. You can try to explain this throughout the movie but then the story became chaos.On part of the effects it's all great and the fight scene's were stunning too but the further you went into this flick the more it lost it's attraction.It starts off rather okay with the making of the game but once they do get into the matrix I was lost. And why does every flick has to be over hours? You really have to get a strong story to do so.So overall, nice to see the fighting scene's again and the classic shots from the original but one you have seen and forgot all about the next day.Gore 0/5Nudity 0/5Effects 5/5Story 2,5/5Comedy 0/5.",6
998,This movie is a disaster in every direction. One would think that 18 years later the matrix could only get better - but it's gone over my head to watch how they released this - I literally felt like walking out of the cinema in the first 20 minutes of watching - the movie itself has no real story it's just stupid loops from the original with Neo a game Desiged just feeling trapped again but with every memory from the original series - the movie has no originality or direction where they are taking the story it just feels it's made for the sake of it.,1
999,"After almost twenty years since the Matrix trilogy concluded with The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions in May and October of 2003, Warner Brothers decided to dust off the Matrix franchise and ""Resurrect"" the series once again with ""Matrix Resurrections"", Was the 4th entry in the Franchise needed?, No, Not really, Even though the Matrix Revolutions seemed like it had a rushed ending and was the least popular of the franchise, It at least ended with zero chance of a sequel, Since Keanu Reeves character ""Neo"" sacrifices himself to save Zion and manages to bring about a truce with the machines, And Trinity played by Carrie Ann Moss perishes in a ship crash in route to the machine city, Matrix Resurrections is strangely missing two important Matrix actors ""Morpheus"" played by Laurence Fishburne, Who was not asked to return to the Matrix Franchise by the Wachowskis and Warner Brothers, Also missing is ""Agent Smith"" played by Hugo Weaving, Both characters are played by younger up and coming actors, Neo and Trinity are miraculously brought back to life, The movie seems very rushed and the effects look cheap, Warner Brothers, Just let the The Matrix Franchise rest in peace.",4
1000,"Just don't even watch it, I love the matrix but this one was very slow, confusing, long winded and will be forgotten about.It was good to see some of the characters back, but they didn't really sure much of a purpose.Don't get excited about watching it.",1
1001,"I went out of my way to write a review, somthing I don't usually bother with. Now, I'm a fan of the original films which is why it irritated me so that this cheap imitation is linked to the franchise.Everything about it is out of kilt with the other three, they have rehashed so much of the originals in a attempt to keep it all linked but it fails to do this. They have loads of new characters that links to the old but it just doesn't work and feels confused.Honestly it just feels like a cash grab not even close to being medioka. Don't pay to see it you will be disappointed.",2
1002,"This film is a bit of a disaster ... but it actually had an idea built into it that could have been really interesting to explore - which is the machines civil war - i.e. The reasoning behind this schism and perhaps making that a key part of the NEW story line. But no, instead its just a weird and tired ""overlay"" of the original film packed with nostalgia re-made flash backs. There is just nothing new here to watch.If you want nostalgia, go back and watch the original.",2
1003,"Terrible film, horrendous story line and even worse acting. They should be ashamed of themselves.Loads of bits ripped from the first 3 but so awfully done I actually thought it was gonna be a parody at some points, never been so disappointed from a film in all my life.My best film is still: Matrix 1,2,3...",1
1004,True story: my husband fell asleep during it and his subconscious felt like dreaming about rearranging his desktop icons was more entertaining than the actual movie.,1
1005,"I do not know where to begin with this movie, however I'll do my best. Apart from Keanu, Jada, and Carrie Ann Moss, the role of the characters felt severely unnecessary and the purpose from the beginning of the movie was confusing. Trinity was barely in the movie. Overall, a woke movie.",1
1006,"Another great series destroyed by the woke brigade. Brings nothing new, the effects and fight scenes don't even bring anything extra 15 years on. Save the pennies and avoid this dross.",1
1007,"I can mildly appreciate about 20% of this bloated, inept, inane, and glaringly pointless 200 million dollar cyberpunk kerplunk, which exists purely on the absurd notion that nostalgia is entertainment. More than a few of us have been waiting patiently for a worthy sequel to what is arguably the greatest sci-fi film of the past thirty years, but The Matrix Resurrections is not the one.",3
1008,"Humans couldn't get past the sentinels before, but now they can.The machines always found Zion before, but now they can't find IO.You had to take a pill and find an exit to leave the Matrix before, but you can have a mechanical dove transfer your consciousness to someone else and take both of you out of the Matrix now (for some reason).Neo was ""The One"" according to a prophesy before, but apparently Trinity is ""The One"" too now.Machines like Agent Smith had sophisticated intelligence before, but now they're apparently proponents of antiquated gender roles (""women used to be so easy to control"").Agents were the bad guys before, but now there's ""bots.""The machines were a unified force before, but now they have wars with each other (which we'll casually mention in order to make the plot work).Being ""The One"" meant you had powers that transcended the understanding and capabilities of the machines before, but now they can literally run circles around you (but not Agent Smith for some reason).Trinity died getting Neo to the machine city, but she's back because MACHINES CAN BRING PEOPLE BACK TO LIFE NOW!An insult to the previous Matrix movies. 3/10.",3
1009,"I went into watching this movie with low expectations, and it was worse than I could have imagined. I don't get how these people wrote/made the orginal trilogy as thats a master piece.",1
1010,"Well, keeping it short, and spoiler free.As a MASSIVE fan of original trilogy, and as someone who although recognizes the second and third movies of Matrix were nowhere as good as the first, but still did enjoy them, and also, watching this with almost no expectations, understanding reboots and remakes almost always disappoint.I have to say. The Matrix Resurrections is a total, massive fail.Story is just... stupid. Incoherent. And idiotic.Keanu Reeves as much as I love and adore him, he is no Neo. In this film... He's more of a... very confused and disturbed John Wick!Which tells you, he did not put any effort into it. Most likely because of how weak the movie was, and how wrong this reboots is.I don't know why they did this. Was a big mistake.If you a Matrix fan, and you haven't watched this, I kinda know I can't stop you.Such a shame they did this.",2
1011,"Rife with woke-ism, beating us over the head with meta-narrative and heavy handed messages, this iteration does an awful lot of telling rather than showing. It is not more than a very rough draft, a meta-Matrix.",3
1012,The matrix is my all time favorite movie. I even love the sequels. But that was garbage! It was like looking to a very bad remake of the matrix. It was hurting my eyes so bad that i wanted to rince them with the 3 previous movies and call the MIB to erase my memory so i could forget what I've seen... I stopped watching half way through i couldn't take it anymore...,1
1013,"'Resurrections' struggles to walk the line between being pure 'member berries &amp; a clever send-up of legacy sequels. When Wachowski leans on her cynicism of modern cinema, there's a lot to love, particularly during the video game stuff and the climax. The ideas aren't bad, but the plot &amp; action? Sorely lacking. Keanu spends far less time doing impressive Kung Fu &amp; far too much time standing still with his hands raised, stopping bullets with his boring powers.",5
1014,"It's not horrible, it's just so meh. And for a 2 and a half hour movie, it managed to feel like 8 hours. If you are fan of the series maybe give it a try, but other than that maybe avoid this.",4
1015,"This is a total piece of insulting, degrading, and dehumanizing garbage. A new low! It doesn't get any worse than this. SHAME ON THEM! I couldn't sit through less than half of it. I walked out. What an insult! What a rip off! This should be a crime.Well, one thing's for certain... They won't have to worry about this movie ever being pirated.",
1016,This is good example when money talks more than reasoning. They prefer to completely destroy Matrix series just for the purpose of making some extra cash. Completely boring and very poor script. They complicated so much that must of the movie is trying to explain the new reality.,4
1017,"I've seen more action in a bingo hall for over 80s.Thus sequel is truly lacking in every department.I waited and waited for the movie to start, but it never got going at all. The film was s devoid of any decent action or set prices. In fact, there was hardly any action at all. Very unlike a matrix film.",1
1018,No spoilers but the first 1/3 or so of the movie explains why this movie was made. They even name the company who wanted it made.It's a pretty dismal movie and I did not enjoy it. You are honestly far better off NOT wasting your time watching it.My 5 stars was inflated because it has Keanu Reeves in it and motorcycles. Otherwise it would be at like a 1 star.,5
1019,"There are some good ideas in there but it's a flaming hot mess. Way too many flashbacks and old references. Not to mention most of the fight scenes are simply idiotic and unnecessary. Some of the cuts and effects are dated too .. let's not even talk about the dialogue.Were the cast and creators forced into making this and though to give the middle finger to the Man? Not sure, but definitely a wasted opportunity.",4
1020,I am beyond dissapointed by this movie .Is the second time in my life when I leave in the middle of the movie .Everything was so wong I coulnd't believe how stupid it is and the music was making everything worse .Cam home to see if is new director or scenarist and was shocked to see is the same one that was in the trilogy .DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!,2
1021,Mainly because a zero star rating wasn't available. This movie was terrible in every aspect. People should be ashamed of being a part of this movie. They obviously tried way too hard to relate to the late teen and early twenties crowd and the entire movie suffered from it. Fist bumping with little machine creatures? Give me break man.,1
1022,"The Matrix was a landmark film when it was released. As for the two sequels that followed. Less said about them the better.The Matrix Resurrections has Lana Wachowski as the main director. She has bought a meta element to the movie. She might even be poking fun at Christopher Nolan movies.In one scene Thomas Anderson is told that Warner Brothers are going through a tough time and demand a sequel.The question for Neo is. Whether he is in the real world or whether it is a computer game. Maybe the post credit scene will tell you more. It certainly parodies the Marvel Cinematic Universe.It starts with an interesting beginning. The older Neo and Trinity suggests that the Matrix story might go to different places. The flashbacks to the previous films comes across as playful.The middle of the movie is where it flags. It has the same issues as the sequels and just feels uninspired.The end has some horrifying set pieces. The writers also poke fun at the right wing which has tried to co-opt the message of the Matrix movies.At least Neo would come away thinking that you should never tell everything to your analyst.Resurrections is a flawed film, it is too long but it is the best of the Matrix sequels.",6
1023,"This movie is literally a let down for me, if you take it as a movie it self is not so so bad movie but as a The Matrix sequel it's really bad I could stand only the first 30 minutes, the rest was like they got tired and they just left the movie to the garbage.Action wise was ok but who cares at the very end?I felt if this movie was never produced I would be happy, I had very good vibe and I was really positive to the sequel also the hype from the trailer but come on men, who really needs this movie?Also Hugo Weaving is missingand Morpheus and then the movie start to become weaker, really sad and very big let down really, for me just 02/10.",2
1024,"I've been on a cloud since I've heard of the Ressurection but.... Damn, seriously? Wish I never saw this film. What a brutal way to attempt reviving a legendary story. The film style makes zero sense. Who's to blame, writing or directing? My favorite story has been turned into a made for TV movie. This disappointed from start to finish!Thanks to Keanu, Carrie and Priyanka for having the same passion for the series as it's fans and coming back! Super bummed for everyone though. Sh!$&amp;@ D$@&amp;""",1
1025,Bored me to death with the poor screenplay and too much senseless talk. Very poor movie. I loved Matrix trilogy but this was a dissapointment.Jada smith's character and acting is so annoyingly painful to watchYou can feel how the movie was rushed and the editor had low standardsYou damaged the Trilogy so bad.,2
1026,"Was very hard to watch this movie, I couldn't even watch it to the end, went out after 1 hour.Gave two stars cause for me Matrix trilogy is an anthology of good movies, else 1 star.",2
1027,"I just saw it ! It was so bad , the actions scenes were lame and the visuals horrible . I can't believe this matrix could not have decent effects and actions scenes after 20 years !! WB broke my heart .",3
1028,Well as insanity would have it. At least one Wachowski Brother decided it was time to completely toss their legacy down the toilet with this abominable attempt to override the greatness that was the original trilogy.This is literal proof that you should Never infuse your own political beliefs with your work. This is not art. This is heavy drugs induced garbage.I am very disappointed Keeanu let himself get talked into doing this especially without Lawrence Fishburne. But i hope Lawrence can be Glad now that they Didn't him come back. What a dumpster fire.,1
1029,Terrible movie looks like a cheap channel 5 straight to dvd movie the camera work is horrendous doesn't feel like ur watching a movie it's like ur watching an episode of home and away.,1
1030,"I finally got around to watching this the other evening, and I guess my first and biggest mistake was to re-watch the original Matrix to refresh it in my mind. The Matrix is still spectacular, even if it has become anachronistic. The Matrix Resurrections was spectacularly ""meh.""Whether it's a movie or a motorcycle, if it's wobbly at the beginning, rarely if ever do things improve to where it becomes a smooth ride. At best it usually ends with a breakdown on the side of the road, at worst it's a flaming heap at the bottom of the canyon. The Matrix Resurrection story starts with Neo back in the form of ""Thomas Anderson"" working as a programmer at a corporation. He's had ""mental issues"" and has a hovering Doogie Howser as a therapist. He's been prescribed medication for his problems - you guessed it, a big bottle of the ""blue pill"" and much of the opening of the movie focuses on Neo/Thomas stumbling through a ""reality"" with a long series of scenes of him taking the blue pill, fumbling the blue pill, having handfuls of the blue pill cascading through his fingers, you get the point.The story just becomes more disjointed from here, and by halfway through I was surfing on my laptop and only half heartedly paying attention to the movie. It did that little to captivate me. The second and third Matrix efforts are masterpieces compared to this mess.",3
1031,"Had potential, but the story sequence and everything just didn't flow for me. Even the hand-to-hand combat and shoot outs were just a jumbled mess. They just reused popular special effects and cuts from the previous installments. Everything from Agent Smith super fast punching Neo up against a wall, to the shell casings falling from the helicopters.They should have played more off of the intertwining of A. I. tech with human innovation. However, I regret watching this because it cheapens my first mind-blowing experience of the first Matrix. I wish hollyweird would realize each sequel they make from a great first original film weakens the entire franchise and dilutes it. For example, the movie the Terminator was so great, I even thought the second one was unnecessary. And now look, the whole Terminator franchise sucks, because of all the pointless cash-grabbing sequels that have very little to do with the first. I have the same feeling that is what will happen to Avatar.Keanu Reeves John Wick franchise also didn't help any with this Matrix, because all the fighting scenes in those were several notches above this movie, and that's saying something because some of those scenes were outright ridiculous and not believable. So disappointed!",4
1032,Now they have erased what is left of the legendary Matrix. This is the only thing they still knows how to do Hollywood in these times. Shame. They just rewrite something and do these effects without a story.,3
1033,"I enjoyed it fully through. I'm glad with the story arch they decided to go with, it added more storytelling along with deeper allegorical meanings that went right over peoples heads apparently. The people bombing on this film just can't handle what comes with being free and only enjoy the thought of being free without the work. It takes action to be free and that thought scares the sheeple as they fear freedom and love their slavery (as mentioned in this film).",10
1034,"Well, it was good to see some nostalgic faces and its trailers were also building up the height for its arrival. But when the day came and i watched the movie i was greatly disappointed. See matrix franchise (The Matrix, Revolutions and Ressurections) has always been known for its ""Q""uality A+ action sequences. But this new one really disappoints that thing. Also it seemed like there were very quick cuts made between fight sequences. Although, it was good to see Neo and Trinity back again.",5
1035,"The first act is a clever and tightly edited setup that does a great job at hinting that there is a larger idea behind this movie, an idea about the state of the world post trilogy that needs Neo to return.Then the movie hits an almost literal wall. It just stops. People start expositing, a lot, and it's awkward, obtuse dialog too, often in complete silence like a homemade movie without a score. Characters act, but, with the exception of Neo, we don't understand why. Interesting developments about the post-trilogy world are introduced, but just as quickly as they're mentioned they cease to matter. From this point forward, good guys are good because they're good, bad guys are bad because they're bad, and they play their parts like hollow automata around Neo trying to reach Trinity.This transition between the first act and the rest of the movie is black and white. A real pity.",6
1036,"A sequel that was too long in the making .Having a 20 yrish gap between movies is akin to when they did the Star Wars sequel trilogy , warranted Lucas was such a grinch about hoarding the rights to make anymore Star Wars movies until like 2013 ,yet they ignored all of those excellent books that were written that took place after Return of The Jedi by Timothy Zahn and others, Instead we got a mess of a sequel trilogy that was both disappointing and felt like a sellout for money rather than story. The same goes for The Matrix Resurrections - when the masses were begging for a sequel 20 years ago and most of those people are now 40 and 50 and lost interest but their kids who are now in their teens and 20's gained interest . Yet again this movie looks lke it was written with a shoestring budget , it plods along with boring dialogue and a confusing plot that has Reeves back in the Matrix with no memory of his former life and Carrie Moss miraculously alive when she had been impaled by several rods of rebar in the Matrix Revolutions(another bad sequel written as a cash grab more than story). How could they rebuild her , I can't remember if she was cloned but she is now married to someone with kids and it turns out she also has been setup in a new life in the Matrix again. It's very confusing and the ending is such a redone copout of the First Matrix movie. Let's just hope they dont make any more sequesl to this mess.",1
1037,"It's meta to the core. The best big-budget extravaganza of the year for me. A new film after The original trilogy where it was all wrapped up with closure was something I looked at with some cautiousness because as much as I wanted to believe in Lana Wachowski, I was not really convinced there was room for a sequel, especially when the trailer dropped and it looked like it's just recycling the original ideas. But the film took a path that is perfect for such a movie in ways that I never thought possible.From the very first scene, it brought us back to the very beginnings of the franchise and then they started asking questions.""It's all deja vu, but something's not right.""""Why are they using the same code to create something new?""From that point onwards, I knew what kind of a film it was and it followed suit till the end magnificently. Every single dialogue in The Matrix, be it callbacks or original was quotable. The film knows what it is. It knows why it exists. It knows what the fans want to see. And it delivers in a way so that everyone knows what it is and have fun with it. The film unlike its predecessors is more interested in giving answers. Answers we don't really want to hear but would help if we can understand why these answers exist and what questions lead to these answers.This film easily is gonna be a divisive one. Either people will be unimpressed by its idiosyncrasy or be amused by it enough to see the honestness of it behind all the tentpole extravaganza. I really want to see this film again and have a lot more thoughts to unpack for which I would really need to give my brain more time.",9
1038,"First of all, credit where credit is due: The Watchowskis always put money you can see on the screen. It is the proverbial technical tour de force. The movie looks great. Comparisons have been made to Christopher Nolan, but I also find a lot of the Wachowski's take on Cloud Atlas as well.At some point, where realities start to be constantly portrayed as a dream within a dream, you stop caring for the characters. When the joys and hardships of a lifetime of experiences can be explained away as being part of a program, why should we care? The movie itself seems to echo this feeling, mocking the fact that in order to resurrect the franchise, it had to destroy the veracity of the original Matrix. They bring to this project a hipper-than-thou self-awareness that is supposed to inoculate you from the cynicism of the effort.It doesn't work. Being a Wachowski project, it is polished and displayed well. But the story itself needed a major re-think before any of this beautiful failure made it to the screen.",3
1039,"It was absolutely disappointing in every sense imaginable, I wasn't expecting much but this was atrocious. One of the few times I walk out the cinema saying what tha hell is going on here and why, why do this director did that piece of collage out of a great movie and two mediocre secuels.",2
1040,"The first Matrix had style, characters and originality. Versions 2 &amp; 3 piggy-backed it and made it a trilogy rather than a Trinity.Number 4 deeply lacks anything of the original: no style, boring characters and nothing new. Even Neil Patrick Harris's cat had class. Overall, disappointing and definitely unsatisfactory.",3
1041,"Those hopes were dashed within the first 20 minutes. If you subtract flashbacks, we probably got an hour long crappy remake of the original. The whole thing was like a big ole bowl of Matrix soup that someone threw together and then gave it a good stir. The fact that Neo couldn't fly was just annoying. The whole thing was annoying. Now I'm just a sad little annoyed person who can't believe I waited for so long to be so disappointed.",5
1042,"I kind of thought this IP was done after the first film. Everything is super easy, barely an inconvenience, not just replacing so many from the first movie.I hope Keanu cashes the check quick.",1
1043,"The first was an Revolutionary Masterpiece, with out-of-the-box thinking and superb special effects.The third sequel left us with a limp noodle ending.This one should've made up for it the 3rds ending but instead it was a complete let down and a massive flop.It relied heavily on flashbacks from the original.Lame to it's core.",1
1044,"Surprisingly the weakest part that really brings down this movie from its potential is the story. To me, this is surprising as Lana Wachowski, the director and co-writer, came back for this movie and if anybody should know how to write a good Matrix movie it should be one of the original creators, right? Unfortunately, that's not the case with this movie. This movie has some really good story concepts that if they picked just one or two to focus on then it would've been a more focused movie and probably more interesting. Instead, we got a movie that's all over the place and the writing isn't any better. There's one scene in this movie that while watching it I wanted to get up and leave because it really didn't need to be included. One thing that makes the original 1999 movie still a classic to this day are the fight scenes so twenty years later the fight scenes should still be just as good and if not better? Once again unfortunately that's not the case here. The fight scenes in this movie are so predictable, maybe because they're the exact same as the first one, and just boring to watch. The fight scenes are boring for two big reasons which are one, the camerawork for them and two, not utilizing slow-mo or bullet time. The camerawork is definitely the biggest issue as most of the time you can hardly tell what's going on and where everybody is. Honestly, though, my biggest problem with this movie is its heavy reliance on nostalgia for this movie. A good chunk of this movie are clips from the first three movies and obvious references to those movies as well. Instead of these just being subtle winks and nods they are just straight up in your face. The special effects in this movie also just weren't that impressive to me. Even though the characters in this movie are definitely weaker than those from the original three movies I can at least say the acting has improved. It was great getting to see both Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinity, back for this movie and to see they still have that chemistry after all of these years. The real stand-out, which isn't really saying much, for me was Jessica Henwick, who plays Bugs, as she really brought so much to this character and actually left an impression on me. I do feel bad for two actors in this movie and those are Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who plays Morpheus, and Jonathan Groff, who plays Agent Smith. Both of them did great jobs in this movie but unfortunately for both of them are playing characters that were made famous by other actors and unfortunately didn't do a good enough job to make these roles their own. Finally, I did really enjoy the updated musical score for this movie that was composed by Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer. In the end, The Matrix Resurrection could've been the redemption movie this franchise needed but, in the end, it was just another flop and is probably the worst one in the series.",5
1045,"Okay, I'm still watching, at 1:46:50 out of 2:27:54 - I'm really trying to stay all the way through but not easy. Someone review on another site stated this was Groundhog Day for us Cyberpunks. And that's how it feels, there's some bones in this script, but no meat, it's not necessarily a bad movie but it's not good, it's like HEY REMEMBER WHEN NEO.....MORPHEUS?? HERE'S SOME GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE BLADE!!!!! I want to like this movie, like I liked the original 3. It has the slo mo bullet dodging kung fu etc. But it feels old, not new and cool like it did in the first three!! It's like trying to be a reboot of the Matrix but it falls flat, no rewatch value, heck I'm having a hard time watching it through for the first time.",2
1046,"Bad acting, bad cinematography. How did they manage the choose bad actors like these. Unfortunately even Keanu is not enough to save this movie. I gave 5 for the old movies sake otherwise it definitely deserve a solid 1.",1

1049,The Wake Up Cover at the end is one of the worst creations ever made by a human being. That ruined a major part of my experience. They should be ashamed!,1
1050,"I went last week with a friend to see it.We had a good time with popcorn and coffee, I liked the intro scene, the special effects are amazing as usual, it is kinda refreshing, but...I seriously don't know who is this movie for. In the middle of it I wondered, is this the Matrix?...If you are an old fan of the trioglogy, most likely you remember every line. Why did they choose to make that fourth installment a documentary and a flash back? I hated those useless flashbacks that made the movie look like a documentary. And made me look like a kid who needs explanation during a movie....The movie is like two parts, one explaining the old and one telling a new story. Who are you explaining to?I didn't get that to be honest. #the_matrix is not a main stream movie, it had a specific audience before and the new movie should not be an exception.I would have liked to go straight to the new story, which is not that bad (chuckle), although it is kind of a stretch on the old, a real stretch. Naome's concerns were questionable to me. A huge mess of the old and new characters. A lot of explanations, I hate explanations in movies, I would rather not understand....Then comes the mood and visual character.Color was a distinctive design element in the trioglogy. The different color cast between the real world and the virtual one, etc. Was very well done and consistent.What the new movie showed was not faithful to that scheme. It has ruined it.I cannot imagine that the makers didn't realize that when it was very carefully contemplated before.Is this a sign of neglegance and lack of dedication? Or is it just a sign of greed and a try to squeeze a couple of extra dollars from an old successful franchise?The outdoor scenes look like they were shot in real streets, unless it is amazingly done with computer visual effects, they ruined the mood for me.We know that the matrix is a virtual world, the street scenes in the trilogy had this unrealistic surreal look to them because they were actually done as CG. So, what happened here? Where is that look? Why did we miss it?...If you compare this movie to the Starwars franchise, you can see a big difference in the dedication. The music, the opening scene, the flying yellow text, the characters build up without repeating. The audience makes the connections and be happy about it. No spoon feeding, no hand holding.The world is the same across the nine movies, you can relate while enjoying the new....Who does that to a 4th sequel of such a successful and distinctive franchise?Which audience do you expect?...A very confusing experience as an old fan.To me, the matrix first movie is a classic of classics. It had a very good concept and a very good excecution that rewrote the history of movie making. The two sequels that followed, nicely continued that and we accepted they came a little less than the first like usual.That 4th movie is perplexing.I left disappointed with so many questions.",5
1051,"Terrible movie. Not even a little bit as good as previous efforts. Who was the target audience? Not me, and I was a real fan of the previous movies. Very poor writing, uninspiring action, and even Keanu's performance couldn't hold it up.",1
1052,This movie just says do not go to another movie or spin-off of the Matrix! Otherwise all the characters you love will turn into empty shells.It seems to me that each and every person in the theater understood that.The film just proved what we all assumed - that Hollywood studio executives do not read scripts before approving them.The film goes against the commercialization of works and beliefs.It's not a Matrix film - it's a parody.Don't go to this movie and let the it die - if you really like The Matrix.,1
1053,"This movie is complicated to watch, not complex to understand, we get it, really, however the execution is too complicated, with cynical spins, and comical undertones does not translate into what the Matrix movies were. The 1st Matrix is one of the best movies ever made because it had integrity, its actors were all memorable, the story flowed, that movie had tonality, color, articulate speech, quality actors, think Laurence Fishburn, the giant Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano, Gloria Foster (the Oracle), and Carrie-Anne Moss. Where is that caliber of actors in the ""Matrix Resurrections"" ??? It's nowhere to be found. Neil Patrick Harris, Really?!?!",2
1054,"The entire movie felt like a sequel of RP1 but in the Matrix franchise. It is chock full of ""smart"" winks at the viewer that is supposed to be ""Oh, this is from that other movie"", ""Hey it's that guy, I remember that guy"" or ""OMG, they mentioned the Zucc"".Basically the entire first hour is scene for scene near identical repetition of scenes from the first Matrix, short clips from that same movie (which only serve to show you easy comparison which movie you should actually watch) and 4th wall breaking references to various IRL stuff.Lace this mess with a lot of wooden acting and a love story that desperately wanted to be a Disney movie and voila.",3
1055,"Lame movie doesn't make any sense, the end is dumb, i feel bad for the graphic effects, those are pretty good, if the movie didn't had that i would have rated it to 3.",4
1056,"Hugo and Lawrence played parts just as important as Keanu. To leave them out was a huge mistake. You almost had Hugo but did not want to adjust schedules. Big mistake. It's not about the product, it's about the quality, when will Hollywood get it. They nailed it with Spiderman, I hope to see that in other films. CAST YOUR PAST ROLES WITH YOUR PAST ACTORS OR DONT FILM ANYTHING.",2
1057,"They have not understood what made Matrix a cool universe- the dark dystopian tones, the interesting themes about humanity and its survival and spiritual undertones and (sometimes) great action. I have no idea what they did here. Feels like the whole team was together in a bad trip or a psychosis and in an echo chamber of bad ideas... WTF.",3
1058,It has strayed too far from The Matrix. If this was just a random film then it would score a 5 or a 6 but they have used the name to profit off of rubbish.,3
1059,"I really wish I took the blue pill and remained in the simulated world where this film was never made.Such a total waste of time and effort, on my part.I really can't believe there's people here giving this 10 stars, but okay, to each his own, I guess.",4
1060,"The entire time I watched this mess, I kept wondering ""why?"" and ""how does this add to the story?"" The truth is: it doesn't add anything and it doesn't have anything to say. This is what bothered me the most. The whole film seemed so unnecessary and the attempts to be clever and meta fell flat. Even returning actors like Keanu seemed to be so detached from his role. I barely made it through the entire movie and will never watch it again.",2
1061,I would have given it one star but this is so bad I can't stop laughing.I'm still watching but I don't know if I'm going to make it.I need to add more characters so here's an extra sentence.,2
1062,"Same old tricks with much worse plot and so much worse acting..First Matrix 1999 its a classic and legendary movie,... everything next just got worse and worse..unfortunately this one is not exception.Cant they just make something new and creative, and please hire actors based on the quality of they acting, those guys just cant pull it off realistic acting. But maybe they are targeting 5-10years old audience.",2
1063,"The first chat between Smith &amp; Neo in the matrix, Smith mentions ""Apparently our parent company has decided to make a sequel to the trilogy with or without us""The director is clearly telling the audience why the movie was made and why one of the director's decided to make it.Because if Lana W. Didnt make it someone else might have.After watching the film... I wonder if the movie would have been better without LW.Because the final product is TERRIBLE!!!3 Stars for the supporting cast trying to do their best.",3
1064,"I was really excited about matrix 4. But this movie is a garbage. It's a middle finger to everyone who loves the first ones. Bad cinematography, really bad plot, bad acting, even bad cgi... (yes 20 years old matrix has better effects). This movie made me so angry. Disgusting piece of garbage...",1
1065,"This really wasn't necessary. The first three fourths of the film are used almost entirely to reminisce about the original Matrix and while the last fourth involves some pretty creative &amp; cinematic action scenes, none of that justifies the existence of this film.The story is cringy and doesn't explore any new concepts, the characters don't have any depth and even the action feels inferior to that found on the original film.",3
1066,"Story is awful. There is no story. Action has no meaning. There's no real fear of anyone actually dying or being hurt. Characters have zero depth therefore the watcher has no vested interest in them. Trinity is ""The One"" or ""The Other One"" just because. There's no journey to awakening or discovered self confidence through overcoming adversity. It was difficult to watch. Took me 2 attempts to get all the way through it. Really not worth anyone's time. I was looking forward to this this movie, what a waste. Our society is disintegrating.",1
1067,"Why resurrect a franchise and not add enough plot twist? Bunch of flashbacks &amp; no new or creative stofyline, mostly lazy writing. Simple evolution in the matrix design would have given this promising franchise, the reboot it needed.. Reloaded had a refreshing enhancement but went downwards on revolutions due to unnecessary dragging of storyline.. When a director realizes these simple editing or redundant storyline mistakes, it's really these small changes can revitalize and add the needed suspense or thrill that the movie needs.. the matrix has a powerful &amp; flexible storyline that can be bent towards a more close to reality storyline, simply by adding new tech that can redefine and envision what a real 18 years of matrix evolution can offer that can show how matrix can work in the real world scenario as to explain how we have already integrated ourselves to that system which helped us evolve as higher beings with much better relationship with the machines. Sorry to say there was mostly reminiscing and not much of the expected thrill that matrix system evolution could have shown how that 18yrs in the matrix world can show atleast 30yrs of enhanced way of integration and living.. maybe la king 1 of the wachowski was a bad move.. so sad..",4
1068,"""The Matrix"". What associations do suface in your head when you hear this word? In one scene of ""Resurrections"", a bunch of characters try to answer this question, making many assumptions. Originality? Innovativeness? Or stupid explosive action? What is The Matrix Effect? There is hardly a single correct answer to this question. But how sad it is to realize that even the characters in this scene seem to understand more about what The Matrix is than Lana Wachowski.When you go to the theaters, you hardly expect to get fan fiction instead of a plot written by professionals who are paid millions of dollars to do it, right? But it seems that those who worked on the sequel to the once legendary franchise felt that this would be enough for the viewer. After all, this is how what is happening on the screen looks and feels. It really is like some other world, not the same Matrix in which the original trilogy took place. An absolutely meaningless world, like the plot of ""Resurrections"". As is the very existence of this new part. And it could be fun to watch Lana and co try themselves in postmodern humor in one of the scenes, if she had not said in an earlier interview that ""she really wanted to return to these characters, because they are so dear to her."" And I want to believe these words, really. But if they are sincere, then we come to a sad conclusion:The Wachowskis are bad writers and not so good directors who were just lucky once to make a masterpiece. That happens. Thanks to the coincidence which brought together an intelligent, exciting plot with a good idea and memorable characters, furious and interesting action, wonderful actors, well-chosen music, ""The Matrix"" was born. A science fiction masterpiece that continues to impress till this very day. And then...The attitude of people towards the sequels was already much more restrained. Then they were followed by such monstrosities as Speedy Racer, Jupiter Ascending and Cloud Atlas. I guess nothing more should be said regarding this flicks. But despite them, many people retained the belief, like they were in a computer simulation by themselves and the very idea was incepted to them by the program. The idea that it is still possible that Resurrections will be a great continuation, a first great film of Wachowskis after a huge series of misfires. And at the moment of the movie's promotional campaign, to be honest, I felt myself like something of a Neo myself - someone who sees what actually awaits us, while others prefer to indulge themselves with the illusion that everything is and will be just fine. But NO.Cheap fanservice attempts work about one time in a series of ten. The character of Smith is here but really is not, and an actor's parodic performance looks simply ridiculous against the background of Weaving's mannerisms and grandeur. Yes, the action scenes somehow rectify the situation, but not enough.The new villain, which was known even before the premiere, whose exposure is presented as some kind of huge revelation, grimaces and does not cause any sense of real threat.Apart from the action and a few nostalgic/fan-service moments, the only positive aspects of the film are Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss and their characters, Neo and Trinity. Keanu is Keanu, and even the best efforts of Lana W. And other screenwriters are not able to screw up his greatness. As well as the fact that Carrie is a great actress. The relationship between them, the chemistry of their characters, is still very powerful. And their plot, their scenes would be a saving boat for the second half of the movie if everything else wasn't so miserable.After such a point, is there even any sense in talking about whether there could have been some revolutionary ideas, like those that were present in the original and gave it a great deal of greatness it acquired? Someone will say: ""is it even possible to surprise the modern audience with something at all?"" And I will answer: yes! But not with special effects, not with fan service, but ideas, the embodiment of real science fiction. It is enough to open almost any classic book in the sci-fi genre, or select contemporary works like ""Permutation City"" by Greg Egan to find new ideas that have not yet been embodied on the silver screen that can be turned into something exciting. Jesus, Zuckerberg with his Metaverse literally wants to bring the Matrix to life! But neither the Wachowskis, nor the Warners, nor any of the creators of Resurrections had the courage to touch these ideas, to embody these metaphors on the screen. Perhaps they thought, ""Why? The modern audience does not need a spectacle for their brains. They only needs a spectacle to their eyes, with a mix of some drama here and there.""They thought so... and filmed the only possible thing that can be made with such approach: a typical Hollywood action B-movie, feeding off the past, but unsuccessfully so, and thus the title is only one thing it shares with the original. I'm done.Of, and of course, the word ""binarity"" has been pronounced no less than a hundred times, even more than ""reality"".",3
1069,"I could barely stay awake during this, what a disappointment. Horrible plot, bad acting, poor characters, amateur cinematography, low budget choreography, and absolutely no soul. This film is just another brick in the ruble of hollywoods demise.",1
1070,"Every performance felt dialed in from afar, the constant flashbacks to the first film only reminded me how bad this was. They should pull this and pretend it never happened.",2
1071,"I don't agree with the negative reviews about Resurrections because this was a sequel and like all sequels it's purpose was to do one thing....entertain. It wasn't as bad as the negative reviews make it out to be and that's because it's a sequel. After Alien and Aliens that franchise went downhill, after T1 and T2, (T4 was pretty decent) that went downhill, after Jurassic Park, the sequel franchise went downhill and after Predator 1&amp;2 those sequel failed miserably and the Fast &amp; Furious all those other sequels tanked as well. So if you go in with a 4th installment sequel expectation, you will not be disappointed because it's a sequel. A solid one time watch.",4
1072,"Sadly it was. Either they've lost their director's touch or they made this in a rush and on a budget. It wasn't awful, some elements were interesting but if you thought this was The Matrix quality you're sadly mistaken, and it was just another different film I watched.",3
1073,"It is a movie that has nothing to do with the Matrix series, which we absolutely love, which tells us that the flow of life enslaves people. It was a simple movie that didn't even choose its characters that didn't convey any philosophical message.",1
1074,"That was probably the worst movie of 2021. Hands down was awful in every single way. Bad acting, bad story, boring action, bad graphics. I couldn't find a single thing enjoyable about it. Neo being a game dev even made me think about quitting the game industry. I watched a review where a guy when off on a huge tangent and there was one thing that he said that I felt really nailed it. This new matrix movie isn't cool. There's nothing cool about it. That's a common problem recently in most things I feel. In art class my teacher would ask you why you made what you made and saying ""because I think it looks cool."" Wasn't acceptable but you could say ""I made this because it's esthetically pleasing."" This movie had none of that. It was shallow, meaningless, and ugly. I never even caught the names of the other characters they were so irrelevant.",1
1075,"This movie had a decent idea. But it's like the writers never actually watched or understood the first three movies. It's almost if they hired a bunch teenagers to reimagine it from reading a comic book.This story honestly would have been better suited to a new episode of the animatrix than a theatrical story. It's just too goofy and too unrealistic to be a feature film.My best line to describe the movie: ""It's decently entertaining as an unrelated independent film. It is NOT a Matrix movie.""",3
1076,"This movie shouldn't have been made. The Matrix Franchise concluded with the Matrix Revolutions. I never really enjoyed Reloaded and Revolutions but The Matrix Resurrections makes the previous 2 instalments so much better than they were before.As much as Lana Wachowski didn't want this movie to be made initially (with the end credits and the mockery she threw at Warner Bros), the Matrix Resurrection is a total insult to the original Matrix and the entire Matrix Franchise.I don't want to waste my time going into how bad the movie was, but to sum it up it is a very boring movie, too much meta and self-referencing, lazily written script with no original ideas that it has to resort to rehashing ideas from the original trilogy.",1
1077,"I get why people may have wanted this, given we didn't know the outcome of Neo from the final Matrix movie.I feel this just still wasn't needed, we don't need a ending or closure for everything, even now, this movie has left it open again for another.This wasn't anything spectacular at all, nothing new, nothing to make you say WOW, it just felt like another Matrix film like we've seen before but this time with Crew characters we don't really care about.It all felt very easy to watch with no great difficulties for the characters, no surprises, no plot twists, maybe it's just me but having seen many movies since Revolutions this just offered me nothing new or exciting.This to me has played on Nostalgia for the people who cared, if you've not seen the previous movies you may not understand completely about Neo and Trinity or how the world and The Matrix works, I felt the originals did a better job on that aspect, but this is just meant as a refresher really, to jog your memory and the characters memories to become who they're supposed to be.Another reboot that is going to potentially ruin the previous trilogy.",5
1078,"REAL TRUTH: We see the world as we are. No matter how great your intentions may be, people will receive what is being said from their level of perception. Some people will never truly understand the premise of this movie until they grow into the person who will.SAD TRUTH: ""You think you hold all the cards because you can do whatever you want in this world. I say go for it. Remake it. Knock yourselves out. Paint the sky with rainbows. But here's the thing. The 'SHEEPLE' aren't going anywhere. They like my world. They don't want this sentimentality. They don't want freedom or empowerment. They want to be controlled. They crave the comfort of certainty,"" (ANALYST to NEO &amp; TRINITY).You know what's typical sheeple behavior? Being overly critical of every. Single. Thing. Are you the analyst? Or are you a Neo/Trinity? Pick a side. Because most people rating this sequel low are just not getting the premise of this movie, at all...and are more focused on the acting, instead of the message Ms. Lana is trying to deliver. To the masses, I might add. Of course, those who get it, really get it. Those who don't have the loudest mouth and the emptiest head, hence the low ratings. Have you ever sat in a crowd while athletes played on the field? The crowd is always full of criticisms and comments. Loud boos and what not. Why? Because their vantage point is different and they are able to see more than the actual players on the field. The players are out there toiling, getting kicked and beaten down and then there's those who criticize, the spectators (aka the Agent Smiths and Analysts of the world). If you have had the pleasure of being both on the field and on the stands, you'll notice that being on the stand is so much easier. It takes absolutely nothing to criticize. Being a spectator allows you to do just that without much responsibility or accountability. However it's the soldiers on the field, the players, who shoulder all the responsibility. It is the player who must focus intently in order to score. It is the player who has to block out the distractions from the crowd so that they can concentrate on the task at hand. Well, in the Matrix (Our world), you are either a player or a spectator. It is YOUR choice. The world is full of spectators and critics. I mean, check them out in the comments. They are more concerned with the performances of others instead of THEIR own. They have criticisms for everything and everyone except themselves. They can afford to be undisciplined and sloppy. But to be a player in the Matrix, you have to train hard because your next game is approaching. It may take years to train, but you have to keep moving forward. Prepare. You cannot afford to be like everyone else. You must separate yourself from the pack. Go the extra mile, push yourself. Train beyond exhaustion. Train like your life depends on it, because it does. We only stop to rest and restore, and then it's back to the training ground.In the end, your life will be what you settle for.",10
1079,It is like a parody of the original one. I don't even know why they made this sequel. It's full of cliches and bad action scenes.

Then - to placate the viewer with the worst kind of callbacks and tired plot devices already well used up from the first three movies...?

It is obvious they the producers are just trying to make some money from the success of the original trilogy, but having said that they could have at least put some effort. The script is bad and super cheesy. There are lots of new characters trying to replace and match the personality of the originals from the trilogy, but their story is shallow. Acting is also bad and not convincing even from the A rate actors! This is somewhat expectable if the script is ridiculous and unoriginal how can they take their job seriously. It doesn't even work as a movie for the fans only since the hole atmosphere is really light compared to the darker original trilogy. This is a movie that people will forget but they will not forget the bad acting from previously top actors.",3

1087,"The Matrix Resurrection was directed by Lana Wachowski, this film was completely different from the previous trilogy, the older sister Lilly Wachowski was not involved with it, and the atmosphere of the film was totally changed. Frankly speaking, I don't really like this one because it only duplicated the same message from the old films.The message of free will and love were still the point that The Matrix Resurrection would like to say, and the director tried to exaggerate the meaning of love in the film in a way. Moreover, too much flashbacks and trilogy footage also ruined the film, it seems to be just a memorial show for the-20-year-ago trilogy. This was nothing but boring with awkward jokes, and the rhythm was so quick as a movie over 2 hours but nothing to be told. The movie repeated the same pattern while saving Neo and Trinity, which was the one reason why the runtime was that long. Many new characters were in the movie and they appeared and were gone in the next second, I didn't remember those faces after I stepped out of the movie theater. I personally hope that there will not be the next trilogy, it must be going to be a disaster.",3
1088,Yet another pump and dump money grab movie. Aweful! Choppy cinematography with one take rammed into another with the strong female lead character crap Hollywood has been pushing as the final insult. I am quite pleased I did not spend one penny to endure this garbage.,1
1089,This movie felt like a Walking Dead filler episode stretched on for 2 hours. Too much unnecessary exposition forced into your ears. The studio felt like they rushed there project with a half assed script and plot. The only thing I can consider somewhat entertaining was the actions scenes that were far and few in the movie. I hope they do justice to this just like they did for the Sonic Trailer.,4

1094,"This movie is a big F you to WB. It's about the studio taking Lana's ability to choose by saying they would continue the franchise with or without them. This is directly referenced in the conversation between Neo and his business partner (Mr. Smith) in the beginning. It's also about Lana finding freedom in controlling their world they created, which is again directly referenced at the very end when Trinity tells the Analyst it's theirs and they'll do as they please.Through this lens I found it was pretty enjoyable. It doesn't seem many of the other reviews I have read on here looked at it like this.If you're looking to watch ""The Matrix"" pop in the 1999 film.",7
1095,"This movie actually had parts that I think saved it from a 1/10 score; however, overall the movie just isn't good. Not only is the story sub-par, but it just doesn't even feel like a Matrix movie. Also, i originally would have voted 3/10, but the ending is so stupid that i had to take 1 star off. Try harder or leave established franchises alone.Edit: I added the star back because Keanu Reeves is always a win.",3
1096,"Extremely disappointing movie. Commercial objectives overtook the story and purpose. The cinematography, action, and features lack enthusiasm and creativity. 😔",1
1097,"This movie has no script, is just a bunch of scenes of the other matrix movies, I don't know who wrote this one, but it's bad, so bad, what a waste of time, I feel sorry for Keanu.",1
1098,"The movie had no plot or purpose. Neo and Trinity are just moved from scene to scene where they fight and talk a bit. And what's up with those non stop clips from the original movies. Or do the makers think people suffer from memory loss ?I fell asleep twice before finally finishing it, it's that dull and pointless.",4
1099,"The only good thing in this movie was the scenes from the older movies. I just finished the movie and I barely remember what was happening and out of all the characters I only remember Neo, Trinity and Morpheus. I wish I could rate this movie 0/10.",1
1100,"They should have called this matrix deceased, just awful dull dross . Why Hollywood keeps handing money to either of the wachowski sisters is baffling, they haven't made anything worth watching since the original matrix. Can we please clone Stephen Spielberg and put him in charge of all remakes please.",1
1101,"Strike 2 Reeves, stop making sequels to franchises long gone (Bill &amp; Tedd, now Matrix)This movie is terrible in the sense what is the point? The story was terrible, the action actually was pretty week too and the ending, so now Trinity can fly and Neo can't, but he can still stop bullets? At least Revolutions was wrapping up the trilogy.",3
1102,It was so bad! What is this? I think you tried to make a children's movie. Marvel jokes. The absurd behavior of the characters. Worst scenario. Zero philosophy. What about agent smith? Why did he keep saying tom? Why didn't he say mr Anderson. Zero charisma. All of Neo's charisma is gone too. They turned him into a weak character. I was very sorry. But what about the end of the movie? They held hands and flew! Trinity flew! Like a Disney prince and princess. Laughed. Now i want blue pill for forget this movie.,1
1103,Turned this movie off after 25 mins. Just absolutely terrible. But every diversity or inclusion and left wing politics you want is in this movie. This is 1984 we are living in now.,1
1104,"The first Matrix movie was made in 1999. The effects were amazing.The camera work, the cinematography, the score, it was perfect.You could tell just how much effort was made making that movie.Every fighting scene in the original movie was expertly crafted, every scene made sense, every character had some depth to it.And then 22 years later we have this. Cheap camera work, mediocre cinematography, awkward scenes, uninteresting characters, weak fighting scenes.Really really bad.",4
1105,"I am just baffled at how bad this was. There was no sense of any danger, coherent story or logic. It was older actors going through the motions following a confused story where literally everyone could guess where it was going.The only funny moment was the frenchman cursing.Especially after seeing free guy, this was just mehhh.And what were they thinking plugging John Wick into the matrix!? It never stood a chance....",4
1106,"So, this is what happens when you take a popular movie franchise, use *some* of the same actors to play the same characters, and put them in a convoluted, non-sensical storyline? Ooooookay.The magic of the first movie is not here. This was a waste of two hours.",3
1107,"If you take everything that was iconic about the matrix and remove it from the movie, you will end up with matrix 4. It's nearly as if it was a fan made attempt. Everything is lesser, the quirky meta narrative is just a waste of time and the humour in the movie is a mockery of the franchise. What a waste.",3
1108,"Don't waste your time. No logic at all, things pop out of nowhere, tough things are done with ease in a second. No style. Just some pathetic attempt to earn money.",1
1109,"It's all going downhill. I only really liked the first movie. Now we are in cash-grab dumpster fire territory. The original actors are too old, and none of the new characters are any interesting at all. They all seem to either have some radical revolutionary personal stylists and personalities.The new agent Smith is especially awful. And a lot of the rest just seems like cheap copies of the great stuff brought to us in the first movie.The storylines are all spent and used up. Trying to extend this further just gives us very very far fetched ideas.All these reboots coming out of Hollywood shows the lack of originality. They should have stopped by now.",4
1110,"WTF did I just watch? I'm still not sure what happened.No one can be told how bad this movie is. You have to see it for yourself. Take my advice and before you get stuck in the theater, bring your VR headset and play Beat Saber or something in your seat. Don't worry about bothering your neighbors, they are quite likely asleep.Random characters entering into the scenes for whom I was supposed to understand their backstory. Who is this? Why does it seem like Neo knows them?The sound was bad, half the time the actors were slurring their dialogue so I couldn't understand what they were saying, or using Matrix vocabulary of unusual words that without context, sound like gibberish.The 20th century has thousands if not millions of great sci-fi novels to draw from and this is the best they can come up with?I could have been at home watching my ant farms.",2
1111,"Over done, bloated and boaring the 1st film remade as what? It is such a shame;'I expected more unnecessary so much potential wasted. I get it they made it for the money it will bring in from a new generation who only know about the 1st film from their elders..watch Spiderman instead or anything else.",1
1112,"Because they thought it was a joke.Between the droning on and on, the robot Pokémon, the awful fight scenes, a 1/4 of the movie being clips from the first 3 movies, the awful soundtrack, CGI that wasn't as good as the older movies, and the way they just shrugged their shoulders through the ending, what am I supposed to have liked?I genuinely don't see where some of these even ""it was ok"" reviews are coming from. It was absolutely awful. The first 30 minutes were very solid, and then it fell off a cliff and didn't even try to climb back up.I usually like pretty much every movie I watch. The only ones I've genuinely hated are Stuck on You, and Open Water. The Matrix Resurrections was so outstandingly worse than both of those movies I just can't understand why it got the go ahead.If you're on the fence about watching it, turn around now and don't look back, it's not worth it. If you're going to watch it anyways, prepare for disappointment to keep you awake at night.",2
1113,"It's pure vomit. I hated every single minute of it. It's a total train wreck. As much as Matrix 1 was a gem, matrix 5 is like a dried nose booger stuck on a desk. It's a complete sabotage. Avoid like plague.",1
1114,Very disappointed. The best bits in this film were the clips from the other 3. Its as if they had to do this to keep the fans happy. Any new story or filming was not even close to being acceptable for a Matrix film.Shocking.,2
1115,"I just have 3 points:1- Is this a remake for the first matrix but they bring back the lead character in the original version (neo).2- Neo look like a homeless dude, they ruined his John Wick look.3- The Matrix trilogy is officially ruined. Even Hanover maker now better!!",5
1116,"I'm still not really sure what I watched. I feel like nothing really happened in this film.For a 2.5 hour film, there should've been more of a climax or resolution. It's very light on action and the action that does transpire is lackluster to say the least.I enjoyed the start of the film, excluding the unnecessary retread of the original film's opening. The White Rabbit sequence and everything with Neo questioning his existence was compelling. The meta commentary was okay at first, but seemed really out of place the more they hammered it home. The constant flashbacks to the original were weird and just reminded me that I could've been watching a better Matrix film.Keanu is as watchable as ever and the relationship with Trinity is solid stuff. I enjoyed Groff and NPH quite a bit in their roles. The recasting thing was odd and the explanation is pretty weak, but the actors did as well as they could, having to live up to some iconic performances. I'm not a massive fan of the franchise, but I still expected something more from this film than empty nostalgia.",6
1117,"To be fair I'm only halfway through it, but don't think I can possibly stand continuing watching this. Shame on everyone that thought this was a good way to reintroduce this franchise to the next generation.",1
1118,"This movie was a shame for all Matrix fans. The jokes about the first masterpiece were absolutely out of place. It felt like the whole crew was in the queer scene. Does every character really have to have this quality? The fight scenes were a joke. Everything was repeated from the first movie, only this time in a colorful world and staged much worse. I don't understand why Keanu wanted to play this role so badly. He looks the entire time like John Wick. Got the feeling that he didn't have fun at all. Like this movie was a bucket list thing, so he can move to another one.",4
1119,"This was a disgrace and total disrespect to the original movies. They really should feel ashamed. I want to forget this ever existed and i wasted my time on this. I am a big fan of the original movies, so this was extremely painful to watch. I cannot understand how they could mess it up so badly, looks like it was messed up in purpose. 0 creativity, 0 effort, if laziness and shame would be a movie this would be it.",1
1120,"Where to start:Colours - Where is the original green colour gone? And why? Classic cheap blockbuster yellow/blue instead.Zero atmosphere. Why to repeat all the time scenes from previous parts? Looks like a parody. Especially scenes with ""New Morpheus"". And when I saw him in this nonsense scene in the bathroom ... (It has to be a bad joke).what was the outfit of Morpheus in the training sessions?fighting scenes so poorslow motion effects looked like from old ""Power Rangers"" TV series(not the movie ).All this philosophical bad talk was so boring and nonsense .Poor humor.(this frenchman as homeless- no comment needed).new Agent Smith looked like a bad character from ""Miami Vice"".and all that Zombie scenes .Why?Only reason for 3 points is for sentiment to Matrix series and actors.I didn't expect much but this was garbage.",3
1121,"I was hoping the articles bashing this fil I had read were wrong, but they werent. This film was a disaster and really shouldnt have been made. Shame on everyone involved for tarnishing the repuation of a great franchise like the matrix.",4
1122,"I sat through this whole movie, even though after 30 mins or so, I wanted to turn it off, but for some perverse reason I don't understand --- I kept watching.To most honestly express my feelings about this movie is that the whole thing was incredibly rushed. It was as though they planned a dull new trinity (the original three) to be sequels and realized just how bad it was unless you imploded and de bloated the plot.All I could really say was: this is just TOO FAST! Everything moved as though the story was a landslide force fed us. They crammed in so much nostalgia. Too much! If they'd have gotten.If they'd have gotten Hugo Weaving onboard for this project, it would have been better, but probably not good enough to save it.It came off as a parody of the original trilogy made by fans who wanted to have some funsies. It wasn't serious enough. There wasn't enough gravity and by the end of the film, I was NOT invested. The final scenes after the credits just reinforced the feeling that this was just that: a parody.The age of Jaesus Neo has passed. Hail the new age of GOD Trinity and worship her glorious beard!Demoted to a sad sidekick, Neo is just happy to have her back.",3
1123,"The Matrix Resurrections isn't worth your time and money. It's a desperate cash-grab that hurtful to fans of the original movie and to fans of the two sequels.It makes Reloaded and Revelations feel like instant classics.There is absolutely nothing reedeeming in Resurrections.The story and dialogue is childish and dumbed down. The pacing is mediocre at best.The fight scenes are more laughable.The new cast and villian are embarrassingly bad, although the script and story make it impossible for anyone to look good in these parts.Just can't imagine how someone saw that script (if there ever was one before filming started) and gave it a go and decided to spend ~200mln on it.",4
1124,"Yes, it isn't ""the one"" if there really are two...we call it ""the two"". Just saying!Ok so to start...I am not a matrix groupie. Yes, I have seen them all, but only because this is one of my husband's favorite franchises. He is a programmer and I think it is a requirement for anyone who writes code.There were a lot of callbacks to the original film and I am really glad they brought back both the original actors to play Neo and Trinity. I hate it when series recast actors...if you are going to do it, do it right.Now for the hard truth, the matrix has never been my jam. There is so little story it gets really boring for me. There is no character development...and as a scientist, the pseudoscience drives me nuts! It comes down to crazy fight scenes and lots of cgi, which I had no appreciation for.The scenes with the analyst where he was a therapist was interesting...only in that I like the details in the room.My favorite part of the entire movie...the black cat, deja vu.If you have to see it, see it. If not there are lots better ways to spend your time.",3
1125,"I found everything about this movie to be awful at best.There's basically no story. They grab Neo out of the Matrix, but without any reason. They do it because the script told them to!Then Neo goes to save Trinity, because that's all he knows to do, now.Then, nothing. Just talking heads talking you straight into the heart of Boredom County, with some basic ""Look at me I'm intelligent"" social critic that is so on the nose it looks like a witch pimple. Oh, and don't forget all the pointless flashbacks to the first movie, and the background characters spewing out what you just saw on screen, and action scenes that have the suspense of a Flintstones episode, and that's about it.Also, to Hell with this new Mr Smith!",1
1126,"I do not plan on watching this. The trailer made absolutely no sense and I really don't want to be upset watching a movie that really should have been left alone after all these years in wait. This looks like it's more visual fx than story. And I love me a good story. I think I'll take a much better chance with the new Spider Man. I just can't do this movie. Spoil it all you want to for me, it just looks like a gimmick trying way to hard. Just stop it.",1
1127,"Thoroughly straight forward enjoyable movie. Unlike in The Matrix (1999) one did not know what was happening, this one left no doubt who and what was happening. Amazing that after 18 to 21 years one's memory of what happened then is easily recalled and neatly ties up any loose ends. Resurrections is flick number four and there is place for more!",8
1128,"This was pretty terrible. Hard to spell all the wrong thinks out. It would take too much time to waste on such a ""film"".There should be a petition to prevent Matrix 5.My suggestion is to rather watch the original for the 14th time.",1
1129,And watch something else! Super happy I wasn't in the theater watching this and could fast forward after 30 minutes. It really is just a waste of time. Worst movie I've seen in a long time. This movie sucks. Shame on everyone involved in this money grab.,1
1130,"I'm sick and tired of movies that are recollecting their prequels, especially in a poor way. When you make a sequel it's crucial to take into consideration whether there's an actual point of doing so. Like this one.. Was there any purpose? Nope. Sadly, nothing but money.",2
1131,"My first issue is the casting; replacing with/adding all these kids to play adult roles makes for an immature and unconvincing film. The new Morpheus character was a joke and embarrassment to the original Matrix. I felt he was making a mockery more than anything else to Fishburne's character. Then adding a ""captain"" who looks 16 years old with blue hair and named Bugs(??) is cringeworthy and infantile. And how did most of these new characters develop a barely-legible British accent lmao? The only convincing and exciting actor was the amazing Keanu Reeves, who also gave us some laughs. Even Jada Pinkett Smith's acting felt as old and outdated as her characters age.My next issue is the lazy convoluted and dull writing with the constant flashbacks from the previous films, that pretty much made this film a lame repeat of the original Matrix. Don't get me started on the major plot and technical issues. The entire first quarter of the film was just nonsense. The camerawork, mediocre action sequences and editing were amateurishly choppy and sloppy. The only interesting (and different) narrative was the love story, but that's not the only part the Matrix fans want to see. May as well just watch reruns of Teen Wolf.The cinematography, V/SFX and score were the only decent parts. Time for Wachowski to take up needlepoint. It's a generous 7/10 from me.",7
1132,"Feels like curry for toddlers. You're expecting the spice to kicks in but it doesn't even until end of the meal. But the smell is the same, look pretty much the same, and taste almost the same. Interesting in a way but not for everyone - even if you're a curry lover.",1
1133,"I didn't expect much from this movie seeing as it was written by someone who has lost their mind. This franchise was ruined after the 1st film. Absolutely no need. Maybe it's the directors way of saying that reality is perception, relating to how he lives in his own reality.",1
1134,"Changing the source of Neo's power to be his relationship with Trinity is ridiculous.The fight scenes were missed opportunities for innovation.The new ""old"" characters inclusion didn't make much sense to me.The inclusion of bot is also poorly conceived.",5
1135,"The first 20 minutes of the movie was such an enormous mess I was scratching my head thinking, wtf? It was a mishmash of flashbacks, new characters, and a confusing uneven mess to start the movie. Then neo finally made it back to reality, with his signature shaved head from the first three movies. It then started to look like a matrix movie. From this point it was so enormously boring I literally fell asleep. When I woke up I shut the movie off, and put something else on. Sometime soon, I am going to drink a couple of Red bulls, and give it another try to see if I can stay awake through the whole thing. To say this was a sequel is a huge joke. I think it would have been way better had they made a brand new movie, new characters new plot, set way into the future. Isn't this movie obvious? They just want the money from the rabid matrix fans around the world. That's it. Such a wasted effort.",2
1136,"Um NO! You can add this movie along with The Last Jedi tothe Garbage heap. Just re-watch the original one again it will make youfeel better lol.I did enjoy the trailer, there that lol.......if you already have HBO fine.But don't waste your money going to a theater. Really not worth it.",1
1137,"You'll notice the first three Matrix films were partly written by and directed by both Wachowski's. The latest addition was directed by one and it shows through the writing and directing. Seems rather rushed, unfinished and not like any of the first three originals. Watch it and you'll see why!",4
1138,"I had a feeling that I was going to be disappointed with this one, and I was right.Let's start with the casting. The lack of Laurence Fishburne was a severe omission to the movie weight. Together, the trio of Reeves,Moss, and Fishburne was perfect on-screen chemistry. Fishburne practically propelled the mystery and hype of the storyline in The Matrix (1999) using his iconic demeanor and tone of voice in the ""Pill Scene"".Next, Neil Patrick Harris. It was difficult to believe Harris as the head honcho of the new Matrix. Perhaps Helmut Bakaitis ""The Architect"" in The Matrix Revolutions (2003) had set the gold-standard for what a high-level Matrix villain should be: cold, calculating, stoic and monotone. Harris' facial responses and body language didn't seem to fit the role he was cast in.Then, Jessica Henwick. I think she was a good fit for the role; a good balance of cheerful and melancholic. But perhaps, there could have been a better choice in Jihae from Mortal Engines (2018) to portray that strong female figure.Lastly, Jonathan Groff as ""Smith"". Understandably when you have a role previously portrayed by the critically-acclaimed actor Hugo Weaving, this new movie character would inevitably fall short of being believable.Aside from the questionable casting, perhaps there was an even greater wasted opportunity to tell a new aspect of the story: machines fighting each other... as well as the story of the machines taking the side of the humans.The narrative had just rushed and glossed over it, which makes it difficult for viewers to grasp the full sensation of the drastic changes in the so-called 60-year timeline of the ""then-and-now"".Matrix Resurrections did try a jab at making humor, which can be appreciated. But, I think this movie needed to be a tad more serious in order for old fans (and new fans alike) to feel that this story continuation is worth it.Lastly, perhaps the script had rushed the ""Trinity rescue"" thing all too soon. It might have been better if Trinity's successful rescue was put in a next subsequent film, thus giving focus on creating a richer context of the timeline gap that would bridge the years since that last movie.",3
1139,"What a glorious mess of a movie. While the effects were ultra-amazing, the story was a convoluted, confusing mess. I didn't get what was happening half the time. At least the original movies were somewhat easy to follow. Too much meta and ""aren't we cute"" during the first part of the movie.I did enjoy seeing half of the cast of ""Sense8"" in roles throughout the movie - nice to know that the Wachowskis loved that cast enough to give them more work!I had to watch the movie over two nights. Couldn't finish it all in one sitting - it is 2.5 hours after all.I really missed Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Jonathan Groff was a little too smug - as he usually plays, while Neil Patrick Harris was enjoyable as always.If you have HBO Max, watch it. As to seeing it in theaters, only if you can sit for 2.5 hours - and I would pay a matinee price only.",5
1140,"(spoilers ahead)It takes a special kind of film and genius to redefine a genre with a brand new idea, something that takes careful consideration in all aspects of production. With the Matrix 1 (original) being one of my most favourite films ever, I had to be really careful not to let my expecations get too high when the fourth installment was announced.Matrix fans were slapped in the face instead.This film is so rushed, so slapdash and so damaging to the existing matrix trilogy that it's more respectful to the rest of the series to exclude this installment as canon. The matrix resurrections should not be viewed as canon.There is a scene in this movie where neo and his boss are talking about warner brothers wanting a fourth matrix 'game' (very meta). His boss wants the fourth 'game' created, and neo doesnt. This scene happens about 20 minutes in.I truly believe that this (or a similar) conversation took place between Lana Wachowski and an exec at Warner Brothers, and that she was forced to make this fourth movie against her will: ""direct it or we will get someone else who will"".There are also a number of subtle clues thoughout the movie that she really did not want to make this one, namely the big parody brainstorming sessions about the 'fourth installment' that are really wanky and corporate, the shamless copy pasting of dialogue from the previous films, and even the immature lines that come out of some of the characters.Three examples that come to mind are (and these are real quotes from the movie - the actors actually say these lines).Jude (Neo's Handler):** sits with neo having a coffee** looks at trinity in the distance""Oh yeah, there she is - total F'in MILF""Morpheus:""Time is always against us, etcetera, etcetera. Noone can be told what the matrix is, blah blah blah. You gotta see it to believe it.""The Analyst:""Resurrecting you both was crazy expensive, like renovating a house, took twice as long, cost twice as much""(referring to overriding coppertops)""And bonus: swarm mode is sick fun""The above are all actual lines. Said by actors. In this movie.This movie should never have been made. :(",2
1141,"The self-referential meta screenplay is mildly amusing in the first half hour of this fourth ""Matrix"" installment. However, it soon wears out its welcome and becomes overly muddled with ludicrous complexity that 14-year-olds will think of as philosophical depth. The bending-over-backwards bullet dodges and the wall-running somersaults quickly become tiresome. Keanu Reeves' iconic Neo somehow keeps the film watchable, but it does remind us that the original ""Matrix"" was never anything more than a very cool 1999 action flick - not a religious experience that some nerds would have you believe.",4
1142,"So just so you warned if you want a good sleeping pill, go watch the Matrix Resurrection, yes that is what the movie was, a bad sleeping pill.Let me say this, i really liked the first Matrix film, it was something new and classic, but from like 10 min in this movie i was like, no i can´t believe this.. i really really wanted to like this movie, but no this is bad ohh yea bad!Keanu kicking some as was ok, but the rest was bad! I mean sleeping bad..Ok i will defend Carrie-Anne Moss, she was fine as well, but the movie is not good.Does it deserve a 1 out of 10, maybe not, but i am just so sad right now that i can´t give it more.. maybe it deserve a 4 out of 10, but that is still bad! So don´t give them you dollars, because that is what this movie is, a money grabbing thing.. hey this is matrix movie, give us your money..! Do not go to the cinema, don-t support this garbageSorry this is a sad that for hollywood.",1
1143,"I'll add this to my growing list of movies that I'll ignore when remembering the original. It was missing the intrigue and compelling story of the original. It just felt like it was being made for the money and nothing more. I was bored, pretty rare in action movies for me.",1
1144,"Let's be real, everyone who is a big fan of the original trilogy, especially the first movie, went to see this movie with HIGH expectations. I mean, it's been 2 decades, new technology, new amazing CGI (look at MCU movies), this movie can only be amazing, right?Wrong. The special effects were not big deal. Most of it was recycled from the first movie. ""Oh he did this in the first movie!"" or ""Oh this happened in the third movie!"". Most of the movie had those flashbacks and copied a lot of the sequences or special moments from the original trilogy over and over to the point where I was wishing I watching the original movie again, instead.I understand they wanted to rely on the nostalgia, but this wasn't the best way to do it. Instead, they should've done something similar to Spider-Man No Way Home, the scene where MJ is falling, that brings us back to the second movie of the second Spider-Man installment, without having to rub on our faces that that it has happened before.Although I love Jonathan Groff and he did an amazing job in the Matrix, he is no Hugo Weaving. No one can do Smith like Hugo. The fact that he kept calling Neo ""Tom"" instead of ""Mr. Anderson"" was a big let down.The new Morpheus back story made no sense to me. It has nothing to do with the original Morpheus, this new character could have a different name. Unless we assume that Morpheus is like the Oracle, which still wouldn't make more sense than just simply give a new name to the character.Another thing that I loved but also hated a little bit was that this was a Sense8 reunion. I absolutely love this series and I wish we could've seen more of it. So, if the first half of the movie made me wanting to watch the first Matrix movie instead, then the second part made me go watch all episodes of Sense8 instead.The constant flashbacks and the ""remember this?"" kind of approach was a big let down.The only thing that was satisfying was to know what happened to the Machines and to Zion. The rest added absolutely nothing new to the story and ending in a ""this is just the beginning"" kind of note was like shooting oneself on the foot, because they're creating the expectation of a second movie (or fifth if we count all of them) and I'm not sure after seeing this one flopping like this.I'm extremely disappointed to be honest. If they do another movie, I hope it's Matrix: The Redemption, because they really need one after this mess.",5
1145,"Loathsome, miserable, pathetic, insulting, deeply cynical, woefully inept and embarrassingly empty. Imagine if Beethoven came back from the dead to write ""Barbie Girl"". The fact Lana Wachowski had anything to do with this pitiful defilement of her own joint magnum opus is quite simply astonishing and inexcusable. The Matrix sequels had their issues but good god, compared to this drivel they seem akin to masterpieces. Absolutely mortifying.",1
1146,"The wachowski brothers did a million times better job with the previous films (legends). If you put the first movie and this monstrosity side by side, this so called movie will look like as if it was done in 99 and the first one done in 2021. The script is so weak, the cgi is horrible with weird choices especially in that 2 frame bullet time animations of Neil's and that horrible train scene... This movie looks like they had no budget, no script, no choreography, no stunt management, no creativity, no cgi artists and no energy on both Keanu's and Carrie's end. I wish we were really living in matrix and we're able to restart from a previous save file in which this thing was not shot at all...",5
1147,"As a hard core Matrix fan, was very dissapointed about overall performance of every aspect of this film. Keanu Reeves acting was awkward. The fighting scenes and the cgi was below par, taking into consideration The Matrix was revolutionary in this aspect. I'm sure everyone was expecting learn how Neo stopped the sentinels in the real world. But we did not get a closure for it. This film will not stay in memory for sure.",3
1148,"Very disappointing, however in order to be disappointed I imagine you'd have to have some sort of expectations of grandeur. I definitely didn't expect anything from this movie as the matrix trilogy progressively got worse the longer they went. This felt like a fan made spoof of matrix and it's truly comical how far they missed the mark on what made the matrix iconic. Even something as simple as neo fighting and shooting (he never touches a gun) fell terribly short. Film students could easily re-create a better story. To me the only redeeming aspect was the somewhat interesting beginning of the movie.",3
1149,"Sad to see how a director can destroy a movie.. this movie feels like it´s own kind, but in a bad way...by the way they are trying to bait us for a sequel of this! Hilarious, rent this movie if you want to see Keanu again, but don´t spent 10-20 dollars on it.The real issue is that the movie just isn't very good. The music was bland, the CGI was ugly, the editing was bad, the choreography was uninteresting and the action was occasionally hard to read a la the Bourne films, the cinematography was lifeless, the script was pretty abysmal, with several interesting ideas all executed poorly3/10 because of Lana wachowski!",2
1150,"Worst movie that I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. Didn't need a remake- especially this comolete disaster of a movie. Washed up hacks...,................",1
1151,"Despite the end of Revolutions, we find Neo(Reeves, who's still got it) seemingly living an ordinary life. However, there is something else going on.Let's get the obvious out of the way. Yes, this has many problems. It being Leftist is not one of them - this series has been that from the very start. I was pleasantly surprised that it is communicating a new message, rather than simply restating the old one. Both are progressive. One of the big issues here is, why does this exist? And ultimately the answer is: the studio wanted profit and they threatened Lana Wachowski that they would make this with or without her. It's clear that while she still has a passion for this property, she doesn't have that many brand new ideas. We mostly get variations on the old ones.This is a soft reboot, in the vein of Star Wars Episode 7, although in some ways it is more similar to Nightmare on Elm Street Part 7. There's a lot of love expressed for legacy characters by new ones. Countless references. They are excessive in amount and frequency. With that said, I'm not sure why people are freaking out that this reuses a bunch of footage from the trilogy... whenever it does that, it is because someone is hallucinating, remembering, seeing through the illusion of The Matrix. The action is bad in choreography(bland, uninspired, boring), cinematography and editing(way too rapidly cut, rather than the long takes we're used to). On the plus side, this does have compelling scenarios for them, ones that fit in the universe and aren't retreads. This looks like it was cheap which it wasn't. The darkness and seriousness has been replaced by brighter elements and it's odd that it feels like this is trying to sell toys when it's R-rated. No, this is not made for people who haven't memorized the first three(why on earth would it be?). The villains are incredibly entertaining, we have as much fun watching them as they did playing them(a huge amount).This features some strong language and a lot of bloody violence. I recommend this only to completists. 6/10.",6
1152,"This is nostalgia 101 a trip back to the sci fi classicthis is not action packed but a trip back in time to see what happened to neo and the free world. Its a trip and bloody good one. Dont understand the bad reviews, maybe they have seen to much ruby rose flicks.I would love however a different take on it directed by Denis Villeneuve or christopher nolan.",10
1153,"Did you ever have a dream which felt like it was a fake, distorted version of reality? You would wake up with bad aftertaste, glad that it was over? That's how this movie felt for me.Being a huge fan of Matrix universe (the trilogy, Animatrix, video games) I have been really looking forward to the continuation of the story. But they took and ruined it for me, and so many others.The story itself was so and so, the visuals were bad, it was so dark you could barely see any of the action scenes. And don't get me started on the music, it was horrendous and out of place.But most importantly, everyone was so out of character, even the ""originals"". It was supposed to be a different world, but some things should not change. (""But some things do"" (c)).Some people would call this ""meta"", I call it a hipster cosplay, or a bad dream I would rather forget.",3
1154,"Spoilers of course;what a mess of a few good ideas. Neo was a whinny little b&amp;^%$ the whole movie. Practically whispered/cried ever line of his.Going back and forth in time, well, at least back as they forgot to mention they went forward as well.Oh the betrayal, of every long waited sequel. I did like the messing with neo's head to make him think he imagined the whole thing caused by to much stress designing the imaginary game of it all. Ok, the game was real, in the movie. So why not a real movie in the movie of the game of the movie in the movie?That trinity could bond with a person, her matrix husband, for 20 plus years and her very own kids, cyber or otherwise then ditch them instantly is in itself inhuman of her trying to regain being human. How about bring them along? Her time with neo is done even if cheated out of that relationship.That the exiles are more powerful than any other character, they can be shot and not die but agent smith and his like can be? And who the hell are they? No explanation offered except to have yet another unnecessary fight scene.That agent smith helped them while hindering them and then for whatever reason, ended their alliance.Any why was morpheus human then not human? Not to mention they didnt re use the larry, the original actor while they re used all the rest of the main character's actors. Except agent smith. I didnt read anything as to why a new actor played him.To many inconsistencies and contradictions.This seems to be a remake of the force awakens bad idea using the matrix universe that was a remake of its own original movie as well.I could have accepted that the matrix world and Zion moved on in peace the entire time until the rogue program of the therapist aka, computer virus, tries to take over. Then having Zion having to rescue the matrix from the therapist working together with agent smith and company.Putting Neo back in the pod just seemed silly and ruined the plot/story cuz the writer/director ran out of ideas and didn't really care much about it except the pay cheque.Some of the same mistakes that i didn't like in the original movie;you die in real life if you die in the game/matrix. Should never have been. Should have only been booted out of the game at a crucial point and to find their way back in, aka, re-spawning.That the matrix seems to be based of the dark net hackers. Not one program to be monitored by its own self that would spot any hacker instantly every time but everyone's just like the net actually is in our world. But this movie isnt our world, its the matrix world that has one only hard drive, so to speak and it programs itself.As in, if I'm good at coding and hacking, i would instantly know someone else hacking my computer. Not so in the internet. But wasn't the matrix implying its one computer, not a system of computers intranetted together?These are the kind of things this and every movie should be scruntinized over before release so its not just a lot of pretty CGI flash bangs money grab. Fix the stupid mistakes first please. I feel cheated out of my money otherwise and would prefer to be refunded like any other good product name offers their customers.",3
1155,"Back to the Matrix's Matrix.Oh my oh my I still can't believe they revived the Matrix after 18 years. After watching, I appreciated the trailer for doing such fantastic job hyping the movie without revealing anything significant.I had a blast with this movie. I won't say what's it about of course, but it found a cheeky and brilliant way to connect to the original trilogy. It took a while to completely figured out what's going on, but it got me hooked and excited. Funny enough the movie used similar elements that made fans screamed and clapped like kids while watching No Way Home. However, unlike that, this element in Resurrection had a real purpose to the story, not just to please the fans.The action wasn't the major part like in Reloaded or Revolution, but it still entertained me because of the big scale as well as creativity.Where the movie didn't do well was having a strong reason to motivate the characters. Because of this, the last third of the movie wasn't as fascinating as the first two-third.Overall, I still enjoyed the movie a whole lot, maybe even more than Revolution. 8.5-9/10.",9
1156,"I really, really wanted this to be a great movie, yet deep down inside I knew how easy it would be for them to screw it up...lo and behold.If you want to see Neo be reduced to an even less interesting character in the matrix, here is your chance. I actually REGRET seeing this movie.For me the trilogy, while it has its flaws, will remain intact and I will just consider this a mid life crisis flick from ONE of the wachowskis.",3
1157,"I remember sitting in the theater 20 years ago, credits rolling. My mind blown.This time, it was the exact opposite. What a waste. I can't even think of one part that I liked.",1
1158,"Waking up from reality. Things feeling different. Everyone is in a trance. Sound familiar? Is that real life we're living in now or science fiction? Why this movie is SO great because it is not even fantasy anymore, it is directly about day to day lie. It all rings completely true, from how the Matrix has evolved on screen from just being a theory, to actually practically showing how it controls people. This would be like Minority Report that the update is not just 'psychic people know you'll murder' but that all the surveillance can pinpoint who is about to murder. Science fiction has shown us avenues all this becomes real. The idea of futuristic Gen Z people who have nothing going for them so go to rescue Neo, is so on point. It is like how all the young kids now still listen to all that stupid dad rock or watch those old movies, because nothing is there for them. They are just hungry for life, for meaning, in a post-collapse system. The movie it is just 'right'. The first movie predicted the world we would live in, and this movie shows us what living inside of it is like.",10
1159,"The Matrix Resurrections was an extremely frustrating, boring, bland and even generic action movie. It somehow lost everything that made The Matrix so special, and in my opinion doesn't even live up to the sequels. Its so peculiar to experience; it has moments that are quite interesting but ultimately bogged down by being in a terrible movie. Where The Matrix had revolutionary action and philosophical undertones, this had none of that. The action was quite lacklustre, some of it was okay but none of it was worthy of the Matrix name. It even felt quite mindless, it didn't have any real philosophical questions to ponder in it; just felt like a jumble of ideas thrown onto the screen. It quite literally made me laugh and roll my eyes multiple times (when I wasn't supposed to), and even had the audacity to retcon and revise the original movies, to the point it didn't even feel like they mattered. It felt somewhat like ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" in how it really betrayed the movies that came before it. I felt like there was potential at the start but as it went along it got progressively worse. The trailer is truly the best way to experience this movie.This really did feel like it was a reluctant sequel. You can tell through the meta commentary this movie has (and there is a lot of it) that Lana Wachowski did not want to make this movie. There is lots of dialogue about how no one wants to return to the Matrix, and strong commentary that really attacks the culture of Hollywood studios' over-reliance on reboots and sequels. There's even a line about how the studio will make a 4th Matrix with or without Thomas Anderson, which is exactly what WB did to Lana Wachowski. It felt like a bit of a middle finger to Hollywood; accepting the job and making this very mediocre at best movie with meta commentary attacking them. I enjoyed the meta pieces of the film and thought they were quite clever, but I will admit they took me out of the film at many points. It also led to moments that felt cheapened by nostalgia or meta narrative, such as the use of footage from the original films. It was such a mistake to intercut this footage as it was jarring to the point of stupidity and even made new cast members really seem terrible.I actually really liked Neil Patrick Harris and Jonathan Groff in the film! They were definitely miscast but I still felt they popped where the others didn't. Neil Patrick Harris was just so much fun to watch onscreen, and while Groff does a terrible Hugo Weaving impression, he is pretty good when he does his own thing and really sells the connection between Neo and Smith where Weaving didn't. Yahya Abdul-Mateen was fine as new Morpheus, but he can't compare to Lawrence Fishburne who I really missed. It was interesting what they tried to do with the character, but it really didn't work for me. It was nice to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne-Moss in their classic roles, but it doesn't feel like they had anything new to offer here. Carrie Anne-Moss was also barely in the movie, but did have a great monologue. Neil Patrick Harris also had a good one too, in one of my favourite moments in the movie.Aside from these interesting monologues the dialogue felt like it was written by a five year old. Same goes for the story. It has some good ideas but they just never went anywhere with it. The movie tried for high concept without bothering to layer in logic. I did like what they did with Neo at the start of the movie, but it just completely revised what the end of the 3rd film meant. This movie also had much lower stakes and just didn't feel as interesting, it was more about the relationship between Neo and Trinity rather than saving humanity; it doesn't play like the 4th film in a franchise. There also seemed to be so many WTF moments where it was hard to tell why/what was happening, especially in the last 30 minutes. It also didn't feel like much happened in the film overall.This movie just felt cheap. It didn't feel like a Matrix movie to me and was even visually boring. There were a few cool shots but nothing like in the first movie. It really had nothing new to offer, and felt like a rehash of the first at best. The most interesting parts were the meta narrative, but ultimately the movie is nothing special. I didn't hate it, there were some good moments, but they just didn't amount to anything good; I just didn't like it as a whole, but really liked some scenes. It just wasn't good. If you like the Matrix sequels I'd check it out, but it is quite disappointing when compared to the groundbreaking original film and feels so disconnected with what made it special. I've heard some people think its great though... so maybe you'll like it! It just wasn't for me.",6
1160,"My word of advice - don't listen to anyone who'll curse and scold this new Matrix part. Resurrection is a huge and triumphant improvement over last 2 weaker sequels, and this new one delivers both great fun as well as excellent action-packed sci-fi thriller. With all the impressive CGI and excellent casting, perfect pacing, huge irony, absolutely tasteful elements of modern coffee / hipster culture, all together Matrix brings us a superb fourth part that both entertains and makes you ponder a lot. All the puzzle pieces are in perfect places here - tempo, visuals, sound, stunts, great jokes at the expense of Keanu and Carrie Ann. Reeves are Moss are impeccable here, as well Neil Patrick Harris who is excellent as The Analyst. The younger cast is a warm welcome, too, as they deliver their parts with gusto and fervor. What also adds a certain flavor to the part is a gorgeous mix of older scenes and new reality. New Agent Smith is a dear darling, especially with his sarcastic remarks and excellent humor at his own expense. I will not disclose the necessary plot details but wanna say, this film is a real must-see, due to its smart plot and endearing mixture of old and new, with all these 20 years at our belt, it is so touching and moving to see our old heroes being brisk and energetic again, strong and superb, smart and sincere.Great effort, worth watching and yes, big Yes to the montage - 2 hours and a half fly like one minute, which is yet another example of a good movie.Hurrah to The Wachowskis, Keanu, Carrie Ann and all the cast of dozens.Also pay close attention to the soundtrack, Wake Up being a huge hit at the very end.And sure, the film is so beautifully shot, with all the gorgeous views and clever editing, that it leaves no time and space to waste any millisecond. Nope, no minute is wasted here, the whole movie is a feast for eyes and a great food for thought.Highly recommended.",10
1161,"The big disappointment, I laughed in some scene, what was the state of that french guy , like a skateboarder rebellious youth hahhahah .. acting camera shots camera shots disaster all bad subject pattern soup we barely lasted for 45 minutes :/Some heroes should never be resurrected, I wish I hadn't watched them...",5
1162,"The movie is mostly dialog - not very good one with the action scenes you have already seen in the trailer - not much more to it. The fights from the original Movie from 1999 look a lot better. They didn't make an effort in anything - script, execution, fight choreography. It this were made as series it would have made more sense.",2
1163,"Neo and Trin are back, (no this is not a spoiler... its in the title and art for petes sake) but for the most part it just rehashes the same plot of the original trilogy. Some slight variation to the story but pretty much we are at the same place we left off after the 1st movie. In other words, this is a reboot without being a reboot... i doubt anyone is fooled.Unfortunately, the novelty is gone and the dialog and general direction are not good in this version of the story. Im actually surprised Reanu and Carrie were willing to do this one. But in general I am convinced that the 1st Matrix movie was simply a happy accident. Every iteration since the 1st just kept getting worse and worse and this movies follows that tradition.Skip this one.",3
1164,The beginning was interesting but as you progress through the story it begins to make less and less sense. There were too many holes in the story that didn't make sense the motivation for the characters was weak and it seemed like they were trying too hard to make it less about Neo and more about Neo and Trinity. Sadly the efforts left a lot to be desired. The visuals and NPH were the best part of it.,5
1165,"Just because you CAN do something does not mean you SHOULD. Yes both Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss are astonishing physical specimens that can still pull off the amazing stunts. Very jealous I am about that. And yes Keanu's John Wick bankroll can fund movies for the next decade plus. And yes you can find younger actors that want to step into iconic roles. But damn someone should have stopped them from making this hot mess that tries to both meta poke fun at the ridiculousness of the franchise while it also serves up more fan service than a Star Wars sequel. Nothing about this works other than the nostalgia it literally tells you is coming in an attempt to make the experience more entertaining and less painful than the last attempt(s) to cash in on what still is an astounding original film whose concept was then completely run into the ground with those truly awful sequels. Only to be, yes, resurrected with even worse results. So a big congratulations to Hugo Weaving, Laurence Fishbourne, and the other Wachkowski, along with everyone else that stayed away from this train wreck.",4
1166,"I won't give it more than a 1 out of 10.* If you will bring Morpheus back then bring the actual Actor, otherwise make a new character with a new name. Same goes with the agent. Those are so iconic and replacing them like that just means there is very little respect to the audience.* Another thing I didn't like was the constant reminder of the previous matrix movies. Maybe a better way would be to make this movie great and people will make the connections by themselves.* The fights haven't came even close to how thrilling the previous movies were. Its insane to think that after all the advancements in movie editing this movie ends up like this. Feels like a low budget movie.* People who saw the previous movies remember that Neo jumped of the building before he could stop bullets with his hands. Neo was at his peak of power when he stopped the bullets from the Agents. That was the turning point of him being able to fight the Agents. So how can he stop all the bullets and zombies and cars but can't jump or fly ?*I can keep going however I think its not worth my time. I'm really disappointed by the movie.",1
1167,"The first film was good. Really good. It had action, heart and originality. By this point, it just feels like a sad money grab with no substance.Plot holes everywhere and if they are addressed, they are the weakest of excuses. Half of the story felt like a bland repeat of the very first film.The acting was stiff and tried to be cleaver, but fell painfully short. There was no reason to care about these characters anymore. The audience is no longer able to identify with them and they appear to just be going through the motions.The story was slow, painfully slow, and contained a lot of very unnecessary exposition. The dialogue and action were very predictable and there was really nothing original about this film.The direction was lazy. Someone had a good idea once and just like George Lucas, has tried to redirect a dead franchise with obvious monetary motives. The character emotion was flat as a result.Overall, if you were a fan of the first film, but not too keen on the second or third one, don't waste your time. This will be two and a half hours you'll never get back.",2
1168,"It's worse. Pure torture. In this case, don't avoid the spoilers. Avoid the movie. It's just sad. Nothing, and I mean nothing works or makes sense. I tried treating it as a parrody, but it soon stopped being funny. No one will see this debacle a second time. Nor any other Wachowski movie.",2
1169,"Unfortunately it so bad, it is a worse one. I just want to forget this. They broke that as expected...Graphic is worse then in old films.Neo and Trinity the only actors how play their roles naturally.Script is terrible.Sound is terrible as well.I regret spending money on this film....",3

Fishy was the true leader with the sheer ginormous Leviathan groinage but he was lied to by the supposed wise ones....if he'd only looked deep inside and decided to take it upon himself to lead the rebellion and ignore Trinity's loser talk. If The Morph had lead the way, we wouldn't find ourselves in some god awful useless fourth film, he would have saved us numbers 2, 3 and 4 and left us with a perfectly great stand alone movie but no, no we had to suffer and maybe that's what the Matrix was actually about all along.....",2
1172,"The entire plot of the movie just feels generic and lacking in any depth which make the entire thing feel unnecessary. It feels like as though they made a story just to bring back Neo and trinity and the world for a few quick bucks. The entire first act is just so drowned in nostalgia and self referential nods that I just found it hard to enjoy the movie. It's not until maybe the last act where things feel somewhat original and by then I couldn't find any connection to the characters or why these events are even happening to begin with. It's convoluted, messy, and generic all at the same time. Not necessary viewing for Matrix fans.",6
1173,"As far as movie goes,its not that bad. It brings nothing new as far as inventions go. Its a sequel, not a reboot so it basicly follows same plot lines and Matrix lore. First half of the movie is interestng, has lot of expositions, so you are caught up with new future. Second part is where movie falls apart with story and is just boring. Acting - Keanu is just bad, outside John Wick series he is unwatchable, Jessica Hendwick is great, girl has a bad habit of choosing bad projects ( Iron Fist and this).",5
1174,"If you feel like watching a movie with an empty attempt at a story, this is the movie for you.Mr Anderson/NEO just stumbles through the movie being dragged along by poor copies of the characters from the first three films. Each character from Mouse to Switch to Dozer had character in the first three movies but I could not tell you who the new ""crew"" is.Any real details that are somewhat interesting are simply mentioned and never fleshed out. For example, who runs the opposing factions for the machines? If machines and humans are working together, does that mean that there are humans on both sides? If there is peace, why are they still hiding underground?Naobi's character is pointless and annoying and the lack of Fishburne as Morpheus other than a few cut scenes takes away from the story.Please end it here. No more reboots, spin-offs, or sequels.",4
1175,"Despite 20 years of technological improvement this outing looks low budget. Fight choreography is clunky and awkward, special effects look like a tv show from Syfy channel.

1176,Pretty sure title says it all.If you make a movie that relies on scenes from your old movies its unlikely to be good at best. 1-3 had good dialogue that made you think with jaw dropping action scenes. This has neither. What a dumpster-fire of a movie.,1

1178,"Back in the day, the two other installments of The Matrix were criticized for having spoiled the unique vibe of the original one.Those movies are *masterpieces* compared to Resurrections. This movie is so bad and stupid, full of unoriginal movie clichés, predictable lines, dumb soundtrack, abysmal lore.Sure go ahead and watch it if you have nothing better to do, like playing checkers.",1
1179,"I think the studios should have rebooted the whole franchise instead of this movie.This could have been 7th alteration of matrix with new cast and everything.Matrix trilogy were trendsetters, I expected better CGI after such a long time. I was disappointed.Rating 5 only because of nostalgia.",5
1180,"To be honest, the film seemed meaningless to me, as they are trying to sew it to the finished franchise, and as a result, the feeling of its uselessness constantly does not leave. Although I will not deny, there are interesting ideas in the picture.Most of all, I was upset that the atmosphere of the classic ""Matrix"" is not in the film, and the soundtrack is clearly worse than the previous parts. The staging of fights is clearly made worse, they fight as if under a stick, and not cheerfully and with a twinkle. Tilogy was the best and the first part was a bomb, a masterpiece movie.",3
1181,"One rating is what I would give and I'm still being very generous !I'm not the only one, I spoke around and found many people disatisfied. The worst movie of the year would still be better.

1183,"Easily the worst Matrix movie that has been made. The storyline is awful, literally not interesting at all. You would think they would of made Keanu Reeves more like Neo instead of Jon Wick. The character playing agent Smith (Jonathan Groff) is such a bad pick for this role ... he literally makes you cringe, he is nothing like agent Smith. Also Neil Parrick Harris is another guy who should not be in the movie ... the guys has starred in a lot of comedy roles, you cannot take him seriously playing in a movie like this ... it's like putting Will Ferrel in a horror movie you just don't see it is because it's not a type of movie you would see him in. Glad I never paid money to see this garbage, literally ruined the Matrix franchise with this !. The movie seemed like it was targeting the new generation instead of the people that were around to watch the originals. Fights scenes were poor, Neo basically lost his mojo ... there was no scene in this movie where you would think ""Neo is the one"". If you thought the Ghostbusters remake was a flop wait till you see this.",1
1184,"Something about the movie reminds me of the terminator franchise... Maybe it's nanoparticle Morpheus or the attempt to literally bring back from the dead the story of the Matrix, and Keanu &amp; Carrie back on screen.It was easy to understand challenging to do so. You have on one side the wish of the fans who were in love with this movie, and on the other side, the real limitations, actors getting old, or rusted, or the fact that the trilogy was so perfect that it doesn't support a sequel, it cannot be matched or less likely overcomed.I must recognize I am dissapointed with the movie. I hoped for more... It's like trying to reheat a two week old soup and hope for having a joy eating it. The young actor's acting is poor... Agent Smith is more likely a high-school student, one of them bullies which playes footbal in the school's team... The merovingian's return is not convincing... He has a very small part... like a guest star, I'm thinking the actor was on set between lunch and dinner.I am very curious if the next sequels will get canceled or not.",4

I convinced my mom to see all 3 originals to see this and she loved it too we both think it's a 10! An exhilarating fun popcorn film with lots of epicness, beautiful cinematography, my favorite aspect symbolism/metaphors and humor. The Matrix 1 is among one of my favorites and to me this is one of the best sequels by Lana Wachochski she did perfect with her visionary style that is mind blowing mastery!Edit: If it makes a difference I have autism and I enjoy most movies others don't.",10

1195,"How did the trailblazing first instalment of the Matrix end up evolving into a piece of amateurish FanFiction?Lazy (the self-referential first third seems to be more like ""the making of..."" than a standalone movie), ludicrous script (many lines seem to be making fun of themselves, ""remember when we used to be cool?""), fawning new characters that add nothing to it, and pedestrian cinematography.",3

It hurts to waste words on this review but save yourself the trouble and watch something way better than this. Why can't I just get a movie deal to remake it? Honestly I think there's just too many pills in this movie and that's before the cameras started rolling. Why I mean why????

1198,"No exception to that rule here.When I was a freshman in college, I really wanted to go out with this beautiful, stylish and smart girl from my English class. It took me weeks to get up the courage to talk to her and I didn't really think I had a chance since there were always so many other guys in her orbit. But, she was really receptive and we dated exclusively for the last two months of the semester until I transferred to another school. We fell out of touch since college is so full of distractions and changes, but about 6 years later when my company sent me to Atlanta to work on a transaction, I looked her up since she lived nearby. I also called up a few other friends from school who I knew were living in and around Atlanta and thought I'd throw a little expense-account-funded party in my suite at the Ritz Carlton in Buckhead. A few of us were already a couple of drinks in when I received a call from the front desk wanting to confirm that I was expecting a female guest and asking me to describe her. I described her from memory and was told my description didn't match so, I said I'd be down in a minute. When I arrived at the front desk, the girl looked almost nothing like she did the last time I'd seen her - to the point I barely recognized anything about her. She had dyed her hair from raven black to a sort of orange with the intention of going blonde and had gained about 50 pounds, but the most shocking transformation was her face and eyes. I learned weeks later, she'd been in drug rehab for the prior 6 months after a family intervention to extricate her from an abusive relationship with a drug dealer who had hooked her on heroin and meth in-between beatings. She had been binge eating to replace the drug addiction which explained the massive weight gain, but her skin, teeth and eyes had been ravaged by the drugs.It was such a violent contrast to my last memory of her, that I was left literally speechless. I tried to act gracious, but couldn't hide my shock and even disgust at what she had allowed herself to become so soon after college. I had a hard time explaining to my other friends who she was and why she had been invited and it ended with her screaming expletives at me as she stormed down the hallway to the elevator as I followed behind her feigning words of regret but inwardly grateful for her departure.This movie is like that.Leave the past alone - it's there for a reason. I wish the creative team behind this sequel had believed that.",1
1199,"We knew this fourth chapter couldn't keep up with the previous ones but seeing such a deep/philosophical topic ruined almost completely by jokes (like Neo too old or not in shape to fly), replayed scenes as flashbacks (like if we couldn't remember them) and adapted in a kinda comedy-love story was very painful to my eyes and especially soul.I wish I wouldn't have ended up saying this but here's another situation where the past should have stayed exactly where it was, untouched, engraved forever in our minds.",4

1201,"So the movie starts the same as the very first one, but a bit different. Let's just say this is going to be a bit of a theme going forwards.Cool, so the prologue is over and it turns out it was all a game? The Matrix, the Chosen One, the machines - it was all a computer game Thomas Anderson made to cope with real life. He's having hallucinations and takes literal blue pills to maintain his sanity, and now he's forced to make a sequel. Huh, so we're doing the meta thing, this might be interesting...Sike! This is still the Matrix, but everyone is depressed! Let's rescue Neo again! Let's show him experience an unfamiliar world again! Let's show him find a purpose in life again!Let's introduce a new Morpheus, though this time he is wearing flashier outfits and makes half-baked attempts to reference the original in a funny way!Let's bring back Merovingian - he was snobby and elitist, repulsive but charismatic in an odd way, and now he's a hobo who hit rock bottom. Let's give him half a dozen lines that will be spliced throughout the fight scene to REALLY hammer this point home - look at the contrast, isn't it funny? ISN'T IT?? Oh, now we're ""breaking the fourth wall"" and he's going on about remakes and whatnot - am I watching a Deadpool movie? It's totally M-E-T-A though, wink-wink :^)Here lies my problem with this film. In an attempt to please ""the fans"", 85% of the movie is just references, trying seemingly so hard to have the same appeal as the original, but be fresh and unique, with funny sprinkled on top, it loses the cool factor entirely and becomes shallow to the point you can't take it seriously. It's like those brainstorming sessions in Neo's game company actually happened in real life. Is this another meta commentary on the nature of modern remakes? I don't care, because it didn't make the movie more enjoyable or its philosophic value more profound (if it even had any to begin with).I can hardly call it entertaining - each movie from the original trilogy had far better fights and music. Don't get me started on the Walking Dead-esque chase scene near the end. Also, what's with the random frames from previous movies? Is it because people apparently forgot what happened in them? Are they meant for those who've never heard of The Matrix?Overall, some moments were silly, some moments were embarrassing, some moments were cringeworthy. Few were epic and inspiring, fewer still - thought provoking. This is not why I watch The Matrix movies. This is not why I fell in love with the original trilogy.",4

You can't just throw in a bunch of ""new and hip"" elements into movies and hope it's gonna be good without any regard of the original tone, I mean do you c suite executives really need to put zombie aka swarm into a matrix movie? For god sake stop killing beloved IP from the past, at this rate what's left of our childhood/teenage years will be nothing but Sesame Street.",2

1206,No words....Just tears...at how horrifically TRAGIC this movie was. Terrible. Would give ZERO STARS if that was an option. I literally wasted 2hrs and 28 minutes of my life... Time I will never get back again. Don't fall victim to this tragedy!,1
1207,Heed the bad reviews. They are true. It's 2.5 hours you can't get back. I'm sorry that I watched it. I had high hopes. It was terrible. I'm just typing now to hit 150 characters.,1
1208,"The first Matrix was a good music video: aesthetics and interesting scenes under a collage of ideas intended to be something original. The second movie was way below expectations, and the third was lousy.The first film elevated the Wachowski brothers to the status of Hollywood demigods, and they remain so, despite having failed to do anything in more than two decades. Perhaps because what matters to North American cinema today is only aesthetics and progressive catchphrases, and not coherent plots. Situation to which the aforementioned directors have a significant contribution.This new film begins with complete self-reference, telling the viewer how he should understand the trilogy, as this was a revolt against the oppressive system; a manifesto in favor of sexual freedom and against capitalist exploitation. But he also seems to know that he really became known, after all, for his main visual innovation: the so-called bullet time.Lana #Wachowski directs this film without the brother-in-a-dialogue, she inserts that the film was only made by pressure from Warner Bros. (some think it's daring, but it's just silly) - and forces your hand on pseudo-philosophy. The most repeated word is ""binary""; when presented with two possibilities, the characters say ""Is this a choice?"" As in the trilogy, the argument boils down to a pretentious litany.Despite this, it is possible to reach the end of the film by putting aside any attempt to understand it and waiting for the action scenes, which, in turn, with nothing to present again, are mediocre at best.Speaking of mediocre, Keanu Reeves (Neo) is really an interesting case: a below-average actor with immense charisma. Their dialogues are again kept in single, short sentences, as if the writers were already creating them with their limitations in mind.Without the appeal of innovation, Matrix Resurrections is irrelevant, and will vanish from mind within minutes of its completion.",2
1209,"Bad... Just very bad. I don't blame lily for sitting this one out now, he's clearly the smart brother. Lana tried to be meta and philosophical but the whole thing was just annoying and poorly thought-out. Don't waste your time on this garbage. Lana needs help.",2
1210,"The stage curtains open ...There was something that bothered me back when I had finished watching ""The Matrix Revolutions"" back in 2003. Something that had gotten under my skin. Now, here in the year 2021, I'd forgotten what it was ... until I watched ""The Matrix Resurrections"". Then it was like total recall and I remembered everything that bothered me nearly 20 years ago. And again ... I was left feeling the same way.Neo is dead right? Apparently not. We catch up with Thomas A. Anderson, a successful video game programmer who has based a trilogy of video games on his dreams of the Matrix. He is unsettled, and the company is pushing for a sequel that will push the envelope even further. Then he receives a text message from none other than Morpheus. Hardly believing what he is seeing, he follows the white rabbit once more to find himself back in the real world as Neo. Everything has changed, and there are new players and new rules - but when he finds out there is a chance to be reunited with Trinity, he lays it all on the line.What made the first three movies special, the original Matrix movie especially, is missing here. There was a certain feel, a certain mood that this 4th film does not capture. It tries to by revisiting scenes and recreating moments, but ultimately, these fall flat. The Oracle is gone, the Architect is gone, others have died, changed, or aged dramatically. The Matrix is stronger, and more advanced - being run now by the Analyst. Oh yes ... Agent Smith? He's still around.I enjoyed the underlying love story between Neo and Trinity, and the respect given to them by supporting characters. The action sequences were well filmed, and the production values are high. All the actors were invested, and not just there because it could be done...but because it seemed to matter to them. However, this isn't anything special. 6 stars out of 10.Oh,..and that thing that bothered me and bothers me still? The Matrix is still there. Even after all this time. Humanity is still imprisoned and in pods under the control of the machines. Nothing has been won. These small battles they are winning, are only distractions from the big picture. If they ever make a Matrix movie where all of this is finally defeated and mankind is truly freed, then that would be a movie worth applauding.",6
1211,What was that? FYI when a lot of your reviews begin with that question you know there are problems. When this was first announced I tried to remind everyone of how bad the last two Matrix movies were. I tried to remind everyone how Reeves couldn't act his way out of a a paper bag. No one listened. Everyone was too excited like they had forgotten how absolutely awful the second and third movies were. I still remembered though. Well those movies were gold compared to this train wreck.,1
1212,"I loved the first one. The second one had some moments, the third was trash, the 4th was a car crash where the outcome was not pretty and fatal.This movie went nowhere for me, fight scenes were too close up, the girl handling Neo kept mumbling throughout. The odd elements which were thrown in as a side idea to promote the elongated exposition that went non where. The harking back to the original content was just plain lazy and cheap. The only scene which drew a laugh from me, was the end, more from derision, rather than humour.Thankfully, a forgettable movie.Please stop and do not make any more.",2
1213,The storyline was complicated &amp; confusing? All these gun shooting scenes.... no one got hurt? Just too fake. Spent over 2 hours in the theater.... so disappointed. They should just keep the original film as a classic. The script is bad &amp; the acting is bad as well.,5
1214,"The dialogue shows an obvious lack of maturity and professionalism of the writers of which some genius thought it would be really funny to make the Matrix overly sarcastic making it feel like it's in a completely different genre. So another words... It's stupid. Had the writers left out the passive aggressive banter towards they're real life Hollywood corporate enemies, it might have turned out more decent. Focusing on a excellent screenplay would have been the greater revenge but in this case it fails in the ratings and the profits. Its biggest fail was to resurrect a Timeless franchise that could have done so well.They even had a decent cast. Total loss of potential in every way.",2
1215,"Neo and Trinity were fine, they had no issues in holding the originality of the first three movies but when prime actors like Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne are replaced with inexperienced actors, the theatrical attractions is destroyed. Its rather obvious that this is propaganda when key words like sheeple are used. This movie was a let down in accordance with current degradation of society.",6
1216,Very bland story and cheesy writing. Reminds me of TikTok storytelling. At some points the dialogue was so boring I nodded off until the next scene. I mean there is nothing to hide - it's a cashcow that exploits the branding of Matrix.,4
1217,Really couldn't believe how bad this film is. Looked like a sci fi channel knock off. Didn't help it's self by flashing back to the original film every 5 minutes so we could see how bad this film was in comparison. It's like warner bros is determined to destroy every franchise they have you messed up the DCEU then there was the dog S**T space jam thing you made not to mention the end of GOT. Instead of subscribing to HBO i should of invested in a chocolate tea pot. I didn't like the faketrix.,1
1218,"Why would you do this? Did anyone read the script? Why did they think this was a good idea? The matrix made ma love scifi, this movie made me hate it. I cant even express my disappointment, I couldnt even finish the movie. Dont ruin your childhood people, dont punish yourself. We have been through a lot, watch something else instead.",1
1219,"This a movie that should never have been made. It did nothing for the franchise. Just another bad movie.The element of surprise was not present, as it was in the first movies. So this is just a dumb remake of all the same, but no wow factor. Special effects is not enough to save this movie, the story was plain and uninspired.",3

1225,"The essence at the start is good, it places a valid bridge between the old trilogy and the present movie. That's all the good this reboot has to offer.Everything else is a silly blend of nostalgia and pretentiousness. It fails to hold the drama, depths and spontaneity of the first movie.The lack of attention to detail is killing the atmosphere; the shallow soundtrack, the irrelevant editing. Trying to touch all bases, trying to be everything, while not bringing nothing new.What a disappointment.",2
1226,Don't bother sitting through the credits. Like the marvel films there is a short scene after credits but they work for marvel. Unfortunately not sure if it's a joke but it's a pretty terrible scene after almost 10 minutes of credits. It lasts 30 second and consists of 4 or 5 random characters (bit characters who appear for about 30 seconds in the actual film) discuss creating a cat matrix; yes you got it catatrix they call it. Wtf very angry as not needed and not even funny.,6
1227,*Zero originality.*Full of plot holes.*Terrible casting overall.Apart from the 3 main key points above you can't ignore the fact that this movie is just trying too hard to be politically correct as well - it's just pathetic. It's so obvious what they're trying to portray and accomplish; at times it's frankly annoying to watch and you feel like skipping ahead.To put it simply this movie should have never been made and you should consider rating it as such in order to deter everyone else from pulling off the same sort of non sense.,2
1228,"Sam rudder had just gotten her first paycheck from the navy. In 'the matrex' sam rudder removes the seating arrangement of a buick and points it in the direction where (far off in the expanse) an individual (also named sam rudder) sits on the floor next to a kitchen table. A plastic duck with iron sphere eyes is born from the wall and immediately splits into two halves. Mainly the idea here is: each half of the duck eats food like a machine. After some time, a fully removed seating arrangement of a Lincoln town car is lit up by a full moon (near 88 cigarette lighters) and a taken apart big mac (separated and organized by its like components) is seen as if it had been taken apart on the floor next to the Lincoln seating arrangement. TOTALLY SEPERATE NOTE FROM MY POEM: this newer matrix film should only be shown to human bodies that aern't alive anymore.",1
1229,"Do your self a favor and spend 2.5 hours doing something else.Original Matrix from 1999, was, and still is, one of the best movies I've ever seen. Because it opens a lot of existential philosophical questions, bring them closer to the broad audience, broaden your views, ignite the imagination and motivate you to think abut life, future and the nature of our existence. Resurrections is quite the opposite of that. It's just another Hollywood trash filled with mindless shooting, fights and effects. If you are 5 years old or just enjoying to look meaningless flashy images, than this is perfect for you. Otherwise, as suggested, do your self a favor, skip this one. Watching the original Matrix again would be far better time spend.",1
1230,"No spoilers here. But wow... just wow. How can a movie with a $175million (roughly) budget be such a flop? Shot in 6k 60fps and it feels sooooo disconnected, so fake, it gives me the chills. I was physically uncomfortable the two times I watched it. The first time I even fell asleep. This is a terrible movie. The OG matrix, 22years old, is a masterpiece and looks/feels a million times better than this. I'm sad I watched it. I need to watch the originals to wash my brain.",3
1231,Forced dialogForced action sequencesForced filmPure garbage. Watch it if you want to fall asleep.Nothing is believable about this film. It's a cheap substitute. Kind of reminds me of the crap that Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music (2020) was filled with.,1
1232,"This movie is a lazy, lackluster attempt to try to ""modernize"" the matrix. Piloted by a clearly aging Keanu Reeves, The Matrix Resurrections features poor action, horrible cinematography, and disappointing performances galore. The part I personally found insulting was the constant use of actual footage from the first 3 films as if they thought the audience needed a constant reminder of what had already happened. It is clear that either Lana Wachowski has completely lost the plot, or that this film was intentionally sabotaged to serve as a satire of reboots. It is clear that there's bad blood between Lana Wachowski and Warner Brothers, as it is quite literally stated in the film that they were forced to make another sequel whether they wanted to or not.",3
1233,"Confused. If you've seen them you will be even more lost and confused because absolutely none of this gobbledegook makes a lick of sense. An interminable, tedious script makes this a long slog. Reeves looks bored ( like most of us ) in half the movie. Some of the new characters ( especially the Asian woman ) acquit themselves well but they have nothing to work with. Wachowski again and once and for all proves she is a two trick pony ( The first two Matrix movies ). Everything else has been an unmitigated disaster. A Matrix series ( not movies ) will one day most likely reboot the story. Let's hope the total hack Wachowski is not involved in it. This was a massive disappointment. Reeves can take the hit but feel sorry for Carrie who is more deserving than this utter trash.",4
1234,"I just watched the movie with great disappointment. Let alone the first movie of the trilogy, it can't even be compared to the 3rd movie, which has named ""revolutions"". It's so pity that words are useless. Neither imax nor any other platform, wherever it is watched, this movie is obviously bad. I gave the movie a 5 stars on imdb for the sake of the beauty that lana wachowski has given us before. If another director had made the movie, I would probably give it a 3 stars for betrayal of the matrix series. I wish Lana hadn't done this to us. The movie is going to be a huge box office hit, they're going to fill the pockets, of course I'm sure of that. However, this movie will not be well remembered by any means. I hope they don't continue this cruelty in the form of a new trilogy. Set your expectations too low.",5
1235,Unwatchable garbage. I can't understand why this was made? Money? I don't know but it's a total flop. Normally I'd say watch it anyway but this is just bad enough to avoid altogether.,1

Not engaging.Like playing a video game but you can't play the game you only get to watch the cut scenes between levels.

1238,"I loved the film. I liked the way it played the postmodern game back on itself, took the matrix idea to the next level, injected humour into the script, hit my brain with a big hammer on multiple occasions and brought the franchise to a gentle lovely hope filled close. It also looked beautiful on an IMAX screen.I look forward to watching it again on Blu-ray as, as with the previous films, More will be revealed on subsequent viewings - films I watched again in the week leading up to watching resurrections.It needed another 20 minutes.",10
1239,"As others have written, this is quite simply a sorry sequel to a brilliant trilogy. In really every department -concept, screenplay, photography, editing, directing etc- it lacks the genius of the original films. In truth the fourth movie feels at times more like a Marvel film than a continuation of the original Matrix movies. Just like with the final three Star Wars movies, to leave intact the majesty of the original films, Matrix: Resurrections should never have been made.",5
1240,Imagine rewatching space jam 2 - it's that feeling but twice as bad. I love the first 3 films; this repeats the first 3 with snippets of the original films every 5 minutes. Painful.,2
1241,"This movie was essentially everything wrong with sequels...It was a completely pointless addition to the Matrix story-line and damages/undoes pretty much all the sacrifice and accomplishments of the previous films. The movie has clips of the original films spliced throughout. This was a pretty big mistake because it reminds you that the 20+ year old original movie not only had a much better more interesting plot but it actually somehow looked much better too.This was clearly nothing but a cash-grab from WB and it's now easy to see why only one of the Wachowski siblings worked on it. High concepts are brought up in the movie only to be dropped almost immediately with no clear message or indication as to why they even brought it up by the end of the film. This film effectively undoes everything accomplished by Neo and Trinity in the previous films for a pointless ""meh"" sequel. It's one of the most disappointing sequels in a long time.",4
1242,"I really wanted to like this movie. I LOVED the original movie, the second was ok and the third was meh. This movie hits you with the nostalgia and classic fight scenes, but it brings the 2021 twist we are seeing in every movie today where the hero can no longer be a man. It wouldn't be bad if it was organic, but this is not.",3
1243,"This film in one word: unnecessary. Literally everything about it is a rehash/remake of some component of the original trilogy. Nothing is new, nothing different, nothing interesting. The characters are dull, the throwbacks and cameos uninspired, the choreography is boring, cinematography distinctly un-Matrix-esque, and the Matrix itself has no feel to it, probably because the filmmakers abandoned the classic green tinge in favour of an absolute explosion of colour, particularly in the costumes which were about as far from the gothic black leather getups of the originals as they could get. I guess they decided it was an upgrade to ""paint the sky with rainbows"".Urgh, I'm so bored of thinking about this film. I would always have gone back to rewatch the originals from time to time, but now I wonder if in future I'll have to include this film as well in a rewatch of the franchise, and suddenly I never want to see any of them ever again.",3
1244,"I never thought it would be possible to mess up a movie this bad. It looked cheap with no memorable action sequences. Fights are filmed with shaky cam, and can't tell what's going on half the time, but it doesn't matter because the story is utter garbage. This movie should've never been made.",2
1245,"This generation needs to stop making sequels...they are purposefully changing the meaning, feel and overall look of previous franchises to meet some ideological new meaning, and it's awful. This movie has no purpose other than to just try and make a few extra dollars at the box office. It's completely thoughtless in storyline and plot, totally misses the meaning and characteristics of the original franchise, and lacks any imagination what-so-ever. As a Matrix fan, I was nothing less than utterly disappointed by the vision represented. They didn't even try to relate to the original feel, banking solely on flashbacks to keep it afoot while their extreme lack of creativity and story progression heaped nothing but uninspiring crap upon us. Only those who liked ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" will truly enjoy this horrible disappointment, the new gen. There is truly no imagination left in Hollywood, and they are ruining long standing franchises in their wake.",2
1246,"Everything about this movie is wrong . The story is lame , the new actors feel like they are straight from a made for TV movie and the action is tedious. Somehow they managed to make the slow motion scenes really lame (this from a franchise that pioneered slow motion ). I really don't get the point of this movie ?It's puzzling how it all went so wrong . I'm questioning whether the other reviewers even have eyes , are these people brain dead ?I think it's time to wake up !",1
1247,"The trailer for the film was epic, but the film was a complete mockery of the original. I just don't see how on earth this could of been a success. I have no clue in the thinking behind this film. Just proof that origins should be left alone and when you mess with things that don't need to happen, it all becomes a bigger mess.",2
1248,"After the first 15 mins of it I was only thinking when will it end, is it not over yet and o no it still has more to go. Neo felt like side character, the story was well probably there are some fan fic out there that are better.",4
1249,"I don't write bad reviews often but this movie screams ""please don't bother"". I promise to god I grade this genre on the curve however this sequel does absolutely nothing to add to this franchise. Complete waste of time that I will never be compensated for. From beginning to the end I was so uninterested. Never felt this way for a matrix movie. At no point was I ever interested. That's a bad sign. DO NOT MAKE ANOTHER SEQUEL! At least if you plan having these same writers, directors, producers involved. Please God for the love of all things holy convince them all to walk away.",4
1250,"I couldn't even finish the movie. Seriously, what was that?You guys know those end of the season re-captv episodes they used to do in the 90s? You know, the ones that just showed clips of the previous 20 episodes because shows need a certain amount of episodes per season?? Well, This is the best way to describe how I felt watching this movie. So many of the scenes in this movie were fillers ( literal scenes from the original movies), therefore making the movie seem cheap.All the ""new characters"" were the same. The fighting scenes were the same, but felt more like a knock- off version of the movies , I've seen better fighting in WB TV shows. Agents weren't difficult to fight... was there ever really a threat in this movie?The plot was boring.The casting was bad for the villains (although I think the actors are good).I didn't expect the movie to be great, but I wasn't expecting it to be that bad.",2
1251,This is the worst movie and should be banned from ever being shown again. Refunds should be given immediately to everyone who had the misfortune of paying money to sit through this abomination and they should be entitled to mental health services for life. The worst! Arrest warrants should be issued to everyone involved in making this movie. End this horror immediately. Do not waste your time.,1
1252,They turned a classic movie into a laughable mess....I truly have no comment!!!!The script was rushed..&amp; the continuity was bad.The action scenes had no substance..I have to add...Why was this even made???,4
1253,The 4th Matrix is just as bad as you would expect it. It is made to suit very particular type of audience and badly represents the continuation of the trilogy. It was very much a waste of time to try to watch it. And yes - I approached it with very open mind and with very little expectation..... yet still got disappointed.,1
1254,"This 4 installment is not the matrix, its a sort of parody for the Matrix mixed with Alice in Wonderland and other woke fest movies. If I had to rank this matrix with the other 3 movies, I'd put it at a solid 11.",1
1255,Yet another truly horrible sequel which is almost as bad as Last Jedi. Do like me and now believe that there is only one Matrix movie and the other don't exist.,2
1256,"This movie looks more like poorly executed satire of the franchise. Awful plot, shallow dialogues, terrible acting and forced commedy on an environment that used to be misterous and complex. Feels like the director was trying hard to adapt the franchise to Hollywood trends. You can even see ""likeable"" ""sentient"" characters and zombie-like hordes. This is simply not Matrix.",1
1257,"SPOILER-FREE.I'm a HUGE HUGE fan of the original trilogy. I absolutely LOVE all 3 films equally. The 90s was my time (I'm 46), music, birth of the mainstream internet and associated culture, this trilogy was an incredible reflection of the continuing modernisation of our culture.So I had massive hopes on this fourth episode. AndI nearly walked out of the cinema. That's how unbelievably BAD this film is.Yes it's great to see Keanu and Carrie-Ann back, but they're shells of their former character-selves.All the mind-blowing aspects of the original trilogy are gone, and what Matrix Resurrections delivers (just barely) is like a family-friendly caricature of a throwback cash grab.Matrix Resurrections is such an unbelievable and directionless mess, relying on constant recycling of old footage and nods at the past, that frankly I think this script shouldn't have been green-lit.Re-casting of some characters with new actors does absolutely nothing to help heave this blundering mess through a pool of thick mud and the new characters are so forgettable I don't even remember their names.I was hoping for a legitimate continuation of the story, but sadly this just doesn't happen for the most part. There's interesting aspects of Neo and Trinity's characters, but it does little to help.A fourth installment should have been made much much sooner. This was left FAR too long.I give this film 3/101 point for Keanu1 point for Carrie-Ann1 point for visuals.TERRIBLE. This film ""resurrects"" nothing. I just don't want to remember I've seen it. It's THAT bad.",3
1258,"They say, ""disappointment is a factor of expectation.""But even though my expectations for Matrix IV were low ... it's hard to overstate how bad it really is.The only reason I continued to watch it was out of curiosity to see how much they'd trash it. Suffice to say they basically turned one of the most profound and creative films of a generation ... into a pretentiously boring SJW-fuelled Marvel cartoon of idiocy.It has no charm, no point, and serves only to degrade the memory of a brilliant original concept ... as well as further dumb-down the creative expectations of our current generation ... whose idea of ""entertainment"" apparently hit rock bottom (and then started digging), quite some time ago.It feels awfully sad ... but somehow, more or less appropriate.One thing the movie got very right was this.""The Sheeple aren't going anywhere. They like my world. They don't want freedom or empowerment. They crave the comfort of certainty. They want to be controlled.""Given what we've seen of how easily and willingly most of humanity has been kowtowed into slavery this last couple of years ... it's pretty goddamn hard to argue with that.#RIPMatrix.",1
1259,"They had almost 20 years to make this..I like how they really tried to make it a great sequel, how they're trying the viewers to question the Matrix..BUT they tried to hard!What could have been, is not good enough.Matrix 2 + 3 is actually better than this One.But, I Did enjoy seeing Neo and Trinity again(too little), and I like all the celebrations from the previous movies. Maybe little too much, it felt I was trapped in a ""bad Matrix loop"", since it was almost exactly the same scenes(or throwbacks).Soooo....+ Good to see Keanu and Carrie again+ Some good Matrix scenes+ hints/celebrations from previous moviesToo long movieNeil Patrick Harris (I like him, BUT not in this kinda movie!)No Fishbourne (I understand why...)Crappy ending. This is not a comedyToo little ""Neo and Trinity kickass""-scenes.No ""wow""-moments at allAs a typical sci-fi/action movie: 6/10As a Matrix-movie: 5/10.",5
1260,"I watched this film in IMAX, entered the cinema with no expectation, but I'm still incredibly let down.I thought, at worst, that Matrix 4 will be an unnecessary sequel like Toy Story 4. But, oh boy, was I mistaken. It's so much worse than I can care to admit. This movie made Space Jam 2 look like a masterpiece by comparison.Morpheus is awkward and does not help the storyline one bit. I do not believe Groff's character one bit.This film is chock-full of member berries that it reminds me of the disappointing Star Wars sequels. They bring back a bunch of characters that should have remained dead.The soundtrack is such a train wreck that I think Rebecca Black's Friday deserved a Grammy.The writing and pacing are so bad, and there's so many Deux Ex Machina, that I don't know how many times I've rolled my eyes. And I believed I'm now permanently cross-eyed.This movie undone so many interesting concepts from the previous trilogy that I can only surmise that this movie is an over-budgeted parody written by Uwe Boll.I thought my heroin-addicted son will always be the biggest disappointment in my life. Not anymore! I guess I have to apologize to him now.",1
1261,"I loved the first MATRIX at first sight. The next two parts fed on love for the first. The last part is so far away from the first one that there is not a grain of sand left from this great beach of love. Seriously, this is one of the worst blockbusters I have seen in recent years.",3
1262,"I wanted to love this. I loved the first movie, and even the subsequent two were good by me. But this... This is so far removed from 'that' world and 'that' vibe that it's almost unbelievable to think that the director had anything to do with the initial trilogy. It felt cheap in so many ways. And the crossing of lines between reality and movie just felt immensely forced and cringeworthy. I seriously hope no more travesties are made following this. Let a good thing be.",3
1263,"The good and the bad:Bad:Horrible fight scene choreographyWeak music scoreTV quality cinematography (no green hue when in Matrix either)Ship crew with small machines helping them that they high five like it's a cheesy MIB movie... seriously??Machines with the characteristics of animals expressing empathy helping the humans? What the fluckers is that?Neo only gets power when trinity is trash talked... ""don't mess with his girl bruh""Scenes force added just to have but add nothing to the storyMorpheus is comic relief with no real depth5 minute speech in the movie complaining about Warner Brothers. Yea, we get it so sad to be you being ""forced"" to make a fourth movie.One of the sisters didn't want anything to do with this messGood:Was free with my HBO Max subscription.",2
1264,"Let me start off by saying that I LOVE The Matrix trilogy. I love it so much I watch it every year around christmas time, just because I love it that much. Unlike other people I love all three of them. So imagine how excited I was to see this fresh new Matrix movie, the trailer promised a lot.Well, everything they shown in the trailer are the only good parts.Its that bad, literally. I honestly don't even know where they where going with this. This entire movie was just a snooze fest with very few really sub par, bad choreographed and even fake looking cgi. Then in the end after a story that literally from start to finish made no sense what so ever, and random short flashbacks to show us how good the trilogy was, they managed to cram in some action in the final 20 minutes. Action that was again badly choreographed, if that at all, with fake looking cgi and just again a story that made no sense what so ever. I don't know what the point of this movie even was, its like that really bad Bill and Ted last movie all over again. Somehow Keanu keeps getting suckered in to these. They say Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving ""don't know why they aren't in it"" but I reckon that they saw the draft and just opted out. To me that makes a lot of sense, I would have to. It definitely would have made a lot more sense than this movie. This was awful, and I simply refuse to see this as the sequel to the Matrix trilogy. It didn't even have that Matrix-ambiance of the trilogy. I will never ever watch this again, and the reason for it is because I love the Matrix Trilogy so much. It will remain a trilogy for me, and I heard rumors of them wanting to do a Matrix tv show. If its anything like this movie I would want to tell them to simply not bother.I definitely hope the new Matrix game will be better than this, but judging by this movie it will be another Cyberpunk type deal. I'm sorry Keanu. I love you, my dude, and Carrie ann moss too, this isn't your fault I could tell you put effort in to this. Unlike the writers and the rest of the team.",1
1265,"What kind of moderately budgeted fan fiction was this? I guess, among the many meta lines in the film, the best one was that Warner Bros. Wanted another sequel and were doing it regardless of the participants, so everyone might just as well cash a paycheck.",3
1266,"Not a 1/10 like the faux outrage critics or 10/10 like the fanboy/girls would have you believe. Certainly underwhelming as a whole with a weak supporting cast and some jarringly poor dialogue. When the scenes are out of the Matrix, everything is familiar and the love starts to build but we are brought crashing back to the reality of the flics shortcomings as soon as the new cast in Matrix scenes start babbling.The 2nd half of the film is better...thank the Lord. Please stop here..I beg you!",5
1267,"As a fan of The Matrix, of the idea that it represents, I am deeply disappointed. I am sick of sequels of movies that does not gives anything and are made with the single goal of making money. Am sad that Keanu and Ann-Marie are part of it.",1
1268,"I guess the filmmakers tried hard to make a sequel after so many years, and good on them for trying, but so sorry to report that it just doesn't work. Needed extensive editing. Extensive. The beauty of the first movie is its tightness. Each word matters. In this film, the script is a mess. There is gratuitous fighting that adds little to the plot. Neo, is not really Neo and there is no point to this resurrection (in the title and previews). I waited and waited for a plot and it never came.There are some interesting special effects but these in no way sustain the viewers interest.It seems this was a committee effort as there is little coherence.I am very disappointed as we made a group effort to see this movie together and had the release date in my diary. It was all for nought and we should have watched something else.",1
1269,"The 3 Matrix movies were all masterpieces. The trilogy defined a new era and a new concept of movies. We as fans all accepted the ending of the trilogy and found peace with never seeing another Matrix movie ever again. Why was such a perfect trilogy disrespected by this joke of a movie. It didn't even feel like a Matrix movie at all. What was the point reviving a perfect trilogy with this ****?I genuinely want to know what the people involved with this movie thought they would achieve with this ""resurrection ""They actually spat on genius characters such as Agent Smith and Morpheus by portraying them in the way they did in this movie.It didn't feel as a Matrix movie at all. Worst movie I watched in all of 2022.I'm going to watch the trilogy again and pretend this joke of a movie never happened.",1
1270,"The worst of all Matrix movies.There is no doubt about that.Lana, it was a very very bad idea.I don't see anything that would catch my interest and curiosity as the first Matrix. That was the only one that is important. The message was clear. The rest it's just.....hundreds of minutes of less interesting ""stuff"".",1
1271,It didn't take too long to realise that this whole movie was going to be a rerun of everything we've already seen played out with differed actors portraying far too familiar Matrix stereotypes. Perhaps it was an experiment to see how The Matrix would look with todays CGI. But there was really nothing new here either in concept or execution.,2
1272,"I'd been wanting to watch this movie for so long and by the end, I was left shaking my head in disgust &amp; disappointment. Below are some things I'd like to point out:1) This movie was unnecessary and singlehandedly destroyed the legacy of The Matrix trilogy2) Hollywood needs to stop casting Priyanka Chopra in films. Go for TV serials instead3) So many flashbacks to the old films were unnecessary. It's as if the team wanted the new generation to ""get in on"" the Matrix hype train. For people of my generation who watched the trilogy, we only needed to watch the movies again once just to recap4) For the last few years I've been seeing Hollywood thrusting women in our faces. Women now are suddenly more powerful than men and are ""better protagonists"". - Wonder Woman 1984, Red Notice, Tomb Raider come to mind.5) The role switch of now Trinity being ""The One"" was below the belt because the entire trilogy is based on Neo's quest to becoming The One i.e. Realizing that he had to make a choice by saving Morpheus and saving Zion. What this movie does is just ignore ALL of that which is ironic because we see flashbacks and scenes from the trilogy throughout the film. He also saved Trinity from certain death &amp; ""moved like the agents do"" which Trinity had seen for the first time6) WTF did they do with Morpheus? Actually saying ""blah blah blah"" felt majorly insulting to Fishburne's Morpheus. Morpheus was pretty ignoble and ignorable like ""stfu already""7) ""Bullet time""? Really? Really?!8) Jonathan Groff was an ""okay"" Agent Smith. Personally, Hugo Weaving cannot be replaced and should not be replaced. Groff's Smith kept grunting and growling; something that I do not recall Hugo's Smith ever doing because he was a machine and he makes everything look effortless.9) With the Wachowski Brothers now Sisters, I get why feminism was continually shoved down our throats but this movie went too overboard. Bugs, Priyanka AND Trinity? You could have just made a Charlie's Angels sequel (where OBVIOUSLY Charlie would be a woman, too) Yeesh.",4
1273,"This film has nothing. No plot, no characters, no direction.I'm a huge fan of the original and very much wanted this film to succeed.Spend your remaining minutes of life elsewhere.",1
1274,2 hours. 28 minutes and 55 secondsOf forced one liners sewn together to create the world's longest trailer to a film that doesn't exit.Why is there a robot that looks like a bionic dumbo in this film?Shame. I like reeves.,1
1275,"An improvement from the previous film but not a great improvement. At least it felt somewhat like a Matrix film in concept but not visually. I don't mean the visuals are bad. The visual effects look good and so does the cinematography but it's missing that iconic green tint. This is obviously a minor issue but it impacts the film a lot. The green tint is iconic to the trilogy and it not being here makes the film feel like it's lacking something. A lot of this film feels like it's lacking. The story is really weak and contrived and it's meta commentary is awful. It's possible to do meta commentary on your own films/genre right, look to the Scream films for that, but it's awful here. They make fun of the tropes but then do the exact same thing without a hint of irony. It feels like they forgot there was meta commentary to this film. It's my biggest issue with this film and it really drags it down. Some of the action doesn't necessarily suck but it isn't great either. It's hard to tell what is going on and it's filmed in such a bland way. The performances are fine. Keanu Reeves is being Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss is fine. Neil Patrick Harris and Jonathan Groff are standouts but I take issue with their characters. Groff plays Hugo Weaving's role from the original films but he just kinda starts being Agent Smith. There isn't any build up prior and he just becomes him. The issue I have with Neil Patrick Harris's character is due to his presentation on screen. They lower the frame rate whenever he is on screen and it looks awful. They lower the frame rate a lot in this movie and it never looks good. This film really didn't need to have been made but at least it has some sort of message which is more than I can say for Revolutions. I probably would recommend passing on this movie and just watching the original again.",4
1276,"I had heard bad things about this ""movie"" ,but i didn't imagine to be this bad....the story was stupid and confusing, the ""new technology"" was laughable, they even have machines as friends now for no reason.....all the new characters are horrible....the action scenes were embarassing, and don't get me started about the ""new"" morpheus.... they also had to add all those feminist crup....more women fighters....an 80 year old woman general (coping starwars i guess)...they gave trinity powers too, because we couldn't have just the guy having those, am i right?? That would be sexist, am i right??? And finally , they even changed the f... song at the end to a cover by a woman of course. I know only the first movie was exceptionally good, but i was expecting something better after all those years.",1
1277,"I don't know where all these 5-7 star reviews are talking about but this movie blows, it's literally pointless lol I like I rather go back to 2020 and experience that whole mess and be one more year away from this God awful movie.",1
1278,"This movie is a retread that appears to be a money grab. Don't waste your precious 2.5 hours. Instead, watch the first movie again if you must. Or move on with real life!",3
1279,"This is not the next huge chapter in The Matrix saga. However, it's very enjoyable return that has some meta fun with itself.If you you love this world and have a yearning for seeing Neo and Trinity again you'll have a good time. Just don't go in looking for more than that.",7
1280,They should have brought back original characters. This did no justice to the trilogy. It was horrible. This has a ton of the same exact scenes from the originals with nothing new to add to the story of the matrix.,3
1281,Unbelievably bad! So much talking and nothing important is happening. Too many unnecessary and useless characters. It destroyed the beauty of The Matrix 1999. The green screens were so bad and cheap that hurts your eyes. Why they made this?,4
1282,"The film does not have a coherent story, there is little to no character development, and the special effects are often flashy and distracting. Overall it seemed like a blog entry or even a series of disjoined tweets which were transferred to the screen without proper work. While I liked some of the messages, which the authors tried to convey, I did not like the delivery. They were not part of the plot and were simply said by characters. That is they were not conveyed by the story but were simply inserted into it as side notes. The criticism of social networks and contemporary relationships with technology would be welcome but in the film it fell flat and was not explored at all. Some of the sets and CGI characters had a cartoonish feel about them, as if they came from a different film franchise altogether. The lead actors did not seem invested at all and therefore gave flat performances. Some of the support cast did a better job but the incoherent screenplay did not help them either. I gave it two stars for the effort of those actors who at least tried and one star for some interesting commentary.",3
1283,"You know a film has missed the mark when you are pleading for it to end. At almost 2.5 hours, too many silly and unnecessary character turns. I'm no gun nut but 20k rounds were fired in this film with zero casualties. Why have any weapons? Other than some neat visuals, there is no connection to characters and only Bugs gives a performance of any note. May appeal to Matrix romantics, but it really doesn't offer anything new.",3
1284,"I am so disappointed from the movie, from the acting, from the visuals, from the actors.Such a shame to call it Matrix at all. I wish someone would stop them when they were just thinking on the continuing...So bad, so goofy, so disrespectful for the trilogy.",1
1285,"Fell asleep halfway through, pointless actions and plotholes galore. At the end they were fighting thousands of ""spawn"" when for some reason when they were done fighting they were pulled out of the matrix with no problem, previously stating ""I can't get them out of there"" then neo and trinity start flying around in the matrix again. Absurd. Also, Neil Patrick Harris is possibly the worst villain ever.",2
1286,"The Fourth Chapter of this Matrix Reboot feels like a rehash of the previous Trilogy with a more tame Scenario and Keanu Reeves not exactly Comfortable in his boots. Although it has all the technological advancements one must expect, it lacks the Mojo of its Predecessors.Average at Best.",5
1287,"With its bad script, acting, editing and story, Matrix Resurrections offered us a average review of the Matrix, a straight action movie, and a bad Matrix sequel. With this production, we have probably seen once again how unpleasant it is to reheat and present things that were very trendy in the past, and seeing this event in a production like The Matrix shook me a little. If it's not enough that you ruined such a good movie years ago, you also bring it to an intolerable level for the new generation, and you earn money from this work. Seriously?? While I recommend Matrix 1 lovers to stay away from the movie, it can be a good for people who want to go to the cinema for a straight action movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like it's worth seeing.",5
1288,"I will need to rewatch it as most of the time I was bored and looking at my phone which isn't a good sign.I really tried to get into this - and I will re-watch it just in case I've missed something. But as a first watch, I'm really upset that this was made.I loved the Matrix Trilogy and I'm usually indifferent and rarely post reviews. But the first 3 Matrix films I feel attached to, it was part of my teenage years and I played the video games aswellthe first film was revolutionary at the time it came out.The reason for making Matrix Resurrections was apparently the theme of ""Grief"" that the director wanted to explore. But this film is so meta and so full of sarcastic humour about the first 3 Matrix films that it made me cringe. There are plenty of films that I have watched that deal with the theme of grief well (The Lord of the Rings being one film) and this isn't one of them. Watching this it feels like I'm grieving the wrong thing - I'm grieving about this film being made in general and that really isn't what the director wanted.The Matrix trilogy films had these specific and thought about camera angles that made the action scenes feel important - so I watched them carefully and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The camera angles drew me in and made me want to watch more. I don't remember a single scene from Resurrections. And that's sad because I was so excited for this. It feels really low budget and lacks any wow-factor with the special effects.There was clearly the budget for the special effects and the costumes and the lighting and the storylines in the first Matrix Trilogy and just about everything drew me in. Fair enough - the 3rd film starts running out of steam and the ending is a bit much, but I still re-watch it. Watching Matrix Resurrections it's just really upsetting to be honest - this is the only thing that I've been excited about during the COVID lockdowns and it's been so disappointing.Maybe I'm wrong to compare this film to Trilogy films that were made in 1999 and 2003. But I can't help it. Those first 3 films are the barometer - I've seen them and they are awesome to this day. They hold the test of time for me and for many other fans across the world. They have a legend quality to them like other great films. But this new film just seems like a Netflix knock-off. Maybe it's the reduced budget? Or it was rushed? Who knows? But it just isn't what I was looking for at all, there's none of that wonder or magic you have when you see great artwork and it's annoying that I feel this way about it because I really liked the Matrix as a concept.The Matrix is such a great concept and allows so much to be said symbolically about the world we live in - but this film just makes me want to forget it exists to be honest. This is a very critical review - but it's how I feel authentically. And I'm sad I feel this way about it as I really wanted to enjoy it during lockdown. I got so excited when it was announced - but the trailers bored me and I thought ""ok, give it a try anyway"". But unfortunately not, the trailers give a good sense of the film.The good thing is that the Matrix Trilogy cannot be messed with - the films have been made and they are out in the world - and so I can always go back to those and enjoy them as a trilogy and just try to forget this 4th Matrix films exists.I tried to be open and I will rewatch it again to see if I'm being too judgmental because I'm comparing it to the films before it. But first impressions are that it's a real let-down. Maybe it's a money grab, like when they remake old franchises for new audiences over generations? But it's a real shame for people who wanted a taste of the old wonder of the first Matrix films.Apart from the meta-irony and nostalgia that this film is full of - it feels empty. It's lost that sense of being great art and feels less important as a result. Maybe that's the point? Who knows? It's so meta. But it's not easy to watch.",1
1289,"The writing was so poor I felt compelled to come read user reviews to see if I was the only one. I'm shocked to see how many people thoroughly enjoyed this garbage. But I guess when so many of us, myself included, entertain ourselves in this era of scrolling social media, the bar has been set pretty low.I don't have the patience nor the interest to list the problems with the movie, but they're plentiful. What a sad way to bring back such an amazing film.",2
1290,"It all feels like a parody callback of all the original scenes and looks like it was shot by a lowbudget yt channel with cgi to shot up the cost of it all.Awfull color wash transitions and current politics shoved up forcefully on the old movie for a simple money grab.With the amount of talent that would have loved to work on a sequel and this is what was delivered? It's like you found a pirate treasure and decided to take the rotting wood chest instead of what's inside.My 2 stars go for ""Neo"" and ""Trinity"" and their willingness to appear on such a poor execution of a fan script.How come this kind of mindless script has 2 (3) writers.",2
1291,"No, it isn't better than matrix 2 or 3. The only thing that remained the same in this new installment was the actors.People love to talk that 2 and 3 was horrible. But those movies were action packed, the fights were good, the acting, the matrix atmosphere was there, etc... You could rewatch those movies TODAY and still have fun.I can't say the same for Matrix 4. No history, no dark atmosphere, no fight coreography, no nothing...I gave it a 5 because, if you compare it with OTHERS movies (not matrix prequels) this would still be kind good.But considering this is a matrix movie that is 20 years a part from the first, it should be GOLD.",5
1292,"An entirely disjointed bore fest. I did not like the ending to Revolutions and was so excited to see a new chapter after all these years, but now I wished it just stayed done at after part 3.",1
1293,"Another victim of recent feminism swaping roles unnecessary on movies. Suddenly trinity is the one who can fly... she is the key etc etc etc.On IO we never see a male figure havin any important role.Also the only captain we see is a women. I have no problem with that, if they would have done a good movie. But matrix 4 was VERY bad.Thanks god is missed it in the cinema.",1
1294,"I don't even know how to articulate my disappointment with this movie. The performances were good, but the script, direction, and cinematography were absolutely terrible. A scene early on joked about Warner brothers contractually obligating the creators to make more films. By the end of the movie this sentiment rang true. Whether it was or not. The majority of this film felt completely devoid of what made the original and even the two other films good. My advice is: if you're a fan of the original trilogy, avoid this movie at all costs.",1
1295,"Matrix trilogy dashed a hypothesis that men are living in a virtual world. It is not like it had never been mentioned before. But I think no other entertainment products made for mass population ever captured the vast majority's attention like this trilogy.Then, with that kind of hype in the background, one come to watch this resurrection. It is like a zombie, not even a ghost compared to its predecessors. Other people have said enough. Anyone who haven't watched it can imagine how big a disappointment they could get from the 4th one.I'd, nevertheless, like to point out another evident point that, the intention is to have more sequels come after the 4th. So maybe in the producer's grand design, the resurrection only serves as a reintroduction of a new set of Matrix movies decades after its last appearance. If it is the case, I would argue, to use a complete movie as re-intro is too time-consuming for many audience and consequently too costly for the investors. Personally, I will go to watch the next sequel anyway, but with much lower hype.",5
1296,Hollywood will go bankrupt at this rate but it's their own fault. They seem to have completely insulated themselves from the outside world and become those elites you see in the movie Zardoz where they believe they know what people want without asking them.That's what this movie is. Why was the only one of the agents in the whole film Black? I am aware of who that agent was supposed to be but among a sea of white agents faces it feels more like a token gesture and virtue signal than a plot point.There were really only 4 main characters in the Matrix that stuck throughout the Trilogy and they replaced all of them except Trinity and Neo. Then they turned the whole concept into a videogame for most of the movie lol.Also very disappointing to see that despite Reeves gun and fighting skills not once is he required to even use them!Only one of the Watchowski sisters wrote this. You can see where the talent was.So when Hollywood drown in their own self-egotism and virtue signalling maybe we'll see better movies. Until then it's only downhill from here.,1
1297,"No positives to this film...The new cast is forgettable, the plot is terrible, Mr Smith awful the fight scenes abysmal and for some reason they decided to do about 20 flash backs of the previous movies throughout the film...The people who came to watch this film didn't need a recap!! 2 hours and 15 minutes of my life i will never get back...Keanu you hurt me today!!",2
1298,I can't recommend this 4th movie in the Matrix series at all.Dull... boring... confusing.You're best either watching on HBO max (if you have it) or by waiting 45 days and you can stream it.Absolutely pointless 3rd sequel and a poor end to this series...i hope so anyway.,5
1299,For every unexpected sequel/remake of our classic favourites comes with an unknown level of suspenseful uncertainty to whether it can predecess the origional or at least justify its necessity. The film starts regretful but slowly emerges with flickers of compitent plot which offers a wiff of deception of a potential worthy predecessor. The film falls short within 30 minutes to an overly complicated story complimented with anticlimactic action. The choice to film digitally over film does show the distinction of reality that Thomas Anderson is experiencing compaired to the other 3 films which complimemts his realisation process to the world he is living but all falls short for every action scene is plagued with comical CGI and poor fight choreography overemphasize by abismal directing. Every fight scene had no emotion nor rememberence to the extent where the film ended i was still expecting a big finale action scene but instead the movie ends by permanently tainting an origional classic that never needed to be touched.,2
1300,"Worst movie ever, I've no words to express my disappointment. We've come from the movie that revolutionized all the modern science fiction and special effects in cinema and ended in this crime to the franchise. I'll give two star only for the Rage Agains the Machine in the credits, the only thing that rest good from the franchise.",2
1301,"While IMO Reloaded and Revolutions are not that bad, at least they had some great action sequences.First I'd like to tell you how I thought Trinity/Neo would be back. I thought that since Neo ""injected"" Trinity with his code to bring her back to life in Revolutions, somehow she would still exist in the matrix. And Neo being the one would still exist in the Matrix as some sort of ""Smith's replacement""Back to our regular programming...Resurrections is a huge MESS, at first I thought that eventually everything would fall in line and somehow make sense. Short story NO.The opening scene is probably the best thing on the movie and NEO isn't even in it. That tells you a lot.The movie fails to explain the hows and whys of every character. Young Morpheus is hinted as being programed by Neo but that's not clear. Neo himself is brought back to life but the scene shows Neo's body with major wounds like a fractured skull with exposed brain tissue and a missing eye. That never happened in Revolutions.The ""I know Kung-fu"" scene with Neo and Morpheus is badly done.There are also hints that everthing in the Matrix is a loop and there are alternate characters ""a la multiverse"" that replace Trinity/Neo on the loops, but then that gets discarded.Yet another storyline goes on Neo/Trinity being a fundamental part of the Matrix, like it can't exist without them, but again, guess what... I'll let you figure it out.You would be led to believe that Smith is the main villain again... and for the most part of the movie it appears so, but then that also went to the trash, and that's really really bad as the main villain is ridiculous. You tought the Architect was bad? Think again.The worst part of the movie is that there is no real threat. Xion (or whatever its called now, I forgot.) is in no danger. Apparently the machines kept at least part of the bargain by not attacking humans albeit apparently not letting pods free. Even Neo and Trinity aren't in any danger. But for some reason (Love) Neo ""must"" selfishly rescue trinity in spite of potentially putting everyone in danger, again for some reason.To think they are already considering a sequel...",5
1302,Nice ideas here and there but overall a waste of time. Best parts of the movie are the copied and pasted scenes from previous movies.Let's hope we will have Morpheus one day offering us a red pill to wake up from this ugly dream.,1
1303,"This was by far worst matrix. Mostly looked like a parody to matrix .... Matrix was serious movie with good action and a charecters with soul.This movie is just a comedy with fake Morpheus and Smith... At least they should make CGI of real actors... Cos ""new"" Morpheus and Smith destroyed this movie even more.Story with very very predictable ending.",1
1304,"What is the Matrix? A cash cow for Village Roadshow. Neo is angry because he didn't get a piece of the gross. Carrie Anne is like a desperate housewife from an exoplanet in the Trappist-1 solar system.If you want to see a real Matrix sequel disguised as something else( which is it's brilliance), rent John Shea's "" Grey Lady"". Nantucket is the Matrix . The lead, played by Eric Dane, is Neo. The police chief, portrayed by John Shea, is Morpheus. When its over....its over. Or is it? How can one keep one's eye on the prize if the prize....isn't real? See for yourself. You'll see.",2
1305,"Only reason I give it 2* is because of Keanu. It follows new Hollywood narrative of diversity and female empowerment, so at the end of the movie, Trinity is more powerful than Neo. Not only that, only reason why Neo was powerful in the trilogy is because he had Trinity by his side. Bunch of bs. The concept it self is honestly pretty weak, tried to mold it into today world, but did a pretty bad job. Agent Smith character is also really badly written. All in all, this is probably the worst sequel of any movie since Alien resurrection. Right up there. They took a dump on Matrix trilogy pretty hard on this one. Awful movie.",2
1306,"So excited to see this, glad instead of buying a movie ticket I used the HBOMax, this should of stayed as a script on the table. It was slow, boring and not entertaining.",2
1307,A huge disappointment. I don't think of any other title to describe what I watched. No real story. It felt like I am watching an episode of a long-running series. The repetition of fight scenes did not make any link to the original Matrix. I did not enjoy watching it. It ruined all The Matrix legacy.,5
1308,"A complete mumbo jumbo of a movie with tons of blah-blah backed up by newbies that are even painful to watch.If you are able to sit through it, at around 60 minutes in, you'll be awarded and your saga begins with lots of other dynamic blah-blah, love story sci-fi version and a whole Matrix world that seems to be located at a green-reality nursing home with respectful ""elderly"" in so much love and care.P.

Idk, it was nostalgic kind of. Somewhat entertaining. But it was also cringe and kind of stupid.I don't really know how to feel about it, tbh. Also the 'catrix' kind of proves my point.",5
1310,"Thankfully I watched this on April fool's day, because it was definitely a joke!It was a garbage film, with no script, no meaning, no characters, no serious dialogs...I honestly think that from one point they just having fun improvising...And I was about to give it a 4.5-5 for the nostalgia, but then I saw the after credits film... And I generously gave it a 3.Matrix is a trilogy. The end!This was not a part of the story.",3
1311,"Everything is bad about this movie, bad casting, direction, editing.. Even keanu reeves acting felt bad for some reasons, That's what i felt while watching this.",3
1312,"Movies today are so unpleasant. Only requirement for a movie seems to be that, you make it ""inclusive"" enough. I had to stop watching this useless movie, so it didn't ruin my admiration for the originals. I wouldn't have paid 50 cents to watch this movie. My 3 stars were for Keanu's beautiful hair I suppose.",3
1313,"Lana wachowski must be high while writing this movies script and I would never understand how such a big studio like warner bros green lit this as a revival of matrix franchise and why would keanu Reeves would come back to such script.I think it's all about money.Neo and Trinity are superheroes in this new movie. Neo can just wave his hand and 4 to 5 cars would fly in air. Omg. In the first matrix there was real tension between agents and neo because neo wasn't this overpowered so all the chase scenes and action scenes you feel a certain tension in them but in here you feel nothing cause they are superheroes.In whole matrix trilogy there are so many action scenes and memorable cinematography is there but in this movie there is not even single scene that i can remember.While watching this movie in theatre i was keep asking myself, what happened to wachowski s i just can't believe these are the same people who created iconic matrix 1999 that changed cinema foreverI just wish they pass this franchise to someone who has real vision and something original to offer to the fans rather than cheap nostalgia.I hope they give it to denis Villeneuve the director who did blade runner sequel or jon favreu who did the mandalorian.",1
1314,"I mean this sincerely, and not to be taken lightly: this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't even mean that based in my opinion or what I disliked, I mean there was no story. Nothing happened for the entire duration of the movie. They never once answer a single question, the characters and fights are uninteresting and have no purpose.This movie is beyond unsalvageable.Keanu Reeves and the cast did a great job, the acting is great, on all accounts they deserved a better story to be in. I'm dedicating the 2 stars the the actors for doing great jobs, the 8 missing stars are for how terrible the story and immersion are.",2
1315,"Making this movie was a big mistake. Could be a career ending decision that the director unfortunately had to make.I'll try my best to keep this review spoiler free.There is absolutely nothing revolutionary about this movie. When the first matrix came out. It was thought provoking, mind bending, cool, changed action forever. There was no other movie filmed nearly as good at the time and maybe even till today. It had a unique feeling. Everything about it was exceptional. Reloaded was not as good and the full CGI fight scene might have not been pleasing to all audience, but still, it was revolutionary in its own way. The Neo vs. Hundreds of Smith fight, the highway car chase, the fight before the car chase was remarkable and very satisfying to watch. Every scene was carefully shot and perfectly edited.Once again they were able to create something that has not been created again till this date.Resurrections on the other hand was a below average movie in general. Not only it did not hold up to its predecessors, it didn't even hold up to some of netflix's original much lower budgeted movies. It had nothing new neither in story nor in filming. So many poor directing decisions were made that is hard to believe that someone with much experience would make. Fighting scenes were very bad. Even Indonesian action films are still coming up with new ways to film fight scenes. Actors did not try hard enough neither did the director. So many shots seemed unconvincing as if they were bored already and called it off anyway and hoped they'd fix it in post. Most characters have no chemistry together. Scenes are not properly stitched. The movie had no flow it just felt so flat and emotionless. And the worst thing was, they kept flashing the previous movies to remind you how much better the they were.I can go on and on on how bad this movie really is. But ill end with saying that somethings are better the way they are. If the director has lost the passion and the energy to create something as good or better than what has already been created, than its better to try something else or retire rather than fooling people one last time to grab their money and in return risk loosing some if not all the glory that was once created 20 years ago.",3
1316,"Bad, bad, bad! For reference I liked some of the earlier movies in this franchise when they were released and I was younger. Those movies have not aged well in my opinion but I was interested to give this a try. It was garbage. I cannot get back the minutes of my life I wasted watching this movie, but you can learn from my mistakes! Watch something else.",1
1317,"So the time has finally come: the 4th instalment of The Matrix has been released after a hiatus of almost 20 years and Neo and Trinity are back, or are they? There's a new crew in town: a group who have been released from The Matrix who are now in search of Neo. Neo, for his part, has somehow found himself back in The Matrix. He has become detached from his true identity and is back to being Thomas Anderson; this time, however, he is not a computer-hacker, he is in fact a games' developer and has a business partner called Smith. The name of their most successful series is called ""The Matrix"", it is a series which recreates the events of the first three Matrix films. Neo no longer has any clear memory of his past exploits actually occurring in real life; he has almost convinced himself that those events are a fiction he has invented. And, yet, there are lingering doubts: why do the events from his game feel so vivid? Why does he feel as if he has experienced them in a world beyond the fictional? And why is he so drawn to the woman who frequents the same coffee shop as him? She looks an awful lot like the Trinity from his games. But that must just a be a coincidence, right?After the disappointment of the sequels, I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film. But, contrary to those expectations, I believe that Lana Wachowski has delivered an almost pitch-perfect post-modern masterpiece; allow me to attempt to explain. The film is replete with references to the earlier films in the series, including a fair amount of original, archival footage, but these references aren't simply designed to function the way they normally do within the continuation of a film series; namely, to explain elements of plot or to provide narrative continuity, they are used in order to provide a reflection on fiction itself. The first film asked the questions: what is reality? And how can we tell the difference between fact and fiction? In Resurrections, Neo is forced to go on a similar journey all over again, but the journey the audience must go on is different this time: now we must ask ourselves, why does any of this matter? Why does it matter whether Neo stays in or comes out of The Matrix? Why does it matter whether Trinity joins him? And, beyond all of that, if we, as an audience, care so much about our characters leaving the world of fiction and joining the world of reality, why have we ourselves chosen to re-enter this fictional world in the first place?We know that Neo doesn't really exist, and yet he does. We know that Trinity doesn't really exist either, and yet she does too. They exist within the consciousness of their creator and they exist within the consciousness of the viewer. Neo and Trinity, for those who care (and why are you watching the film if you don't) are an extension of ourselves. They represent the hero and heroine in each of us. They represent triumph against adversity, they represent bravery, self-sacrifice and, most importantly within the context of this film, they represent love. The essential value of these characters is demonstrated in the connection that exists between themselves and it's that connection which Wachowski uses, alongside the audience's more general connection to the iconography, mythology and philosophy of The Matrix, to establish the film's value. There is a meta-level of self-awareness which the film's script and direction is able to deftly employ. Wachowski is quite openly showing us what she is doing, she wants us to be aware of it. Consequently, the film is able to develop as a love-note to fiction itself. It is a celebration of the value of art and creativity. In so clearly being aware of itself and in finding value in the creative journey that made itself possible, the film unashamedly invites its audience on a journey of meaning and belonging in a way that only the most heartfelt and inspired forms of fiction can manage.Having said all of this, the film will alienate many. This is partly because it is not The Matrix of 1999 or even The Matrix of 2003. It is, rather, The Matrix of a new era and a new time. And just as self-awareness and post-modern deconstructionism are concepts which have developed in art and in society more broadly, so has The Matrix developed. It consciously confronts suffering, isolation, disconnection and lack of purpose and, in response, it provides creativity, connection, reverence and love. That is what this film is to me, it is a declaration of love: love for the artistic process of creation, and love for love itself as redemption from suffering and pain. It succeeds so well because it knows what it is and it contains all of the verve, energy and originality of the original film but, this time, it uses those tools for a more essential purpose. Its plot is not as tight, and its narrative is far from traditional but, ultimately, the former is only vaguely important and the latter is very much the point.Having watched the film only once so far, I am convinced that this is a work of profound value. I was deeply moved whilst watching it and I'm almost just as moved whilst reflecting on it. It's films like this which continue my own personal love-affair with cinema.",10
1318,"If your pre-teen and you watch movies in order to see fights then you might give it a try and and even enjoy parts of it. If you're a movie lover it's simply unwatchable, mainly because of the poor script. A total mess and a waste of studio money.",2
1319,"Like I do not know where to begin....It feels like they violated a legendary trilogy just to make some bucks.I know that marketing algorithms dictate to serve yesterday's food retouched and at a premium price instead of risking at attempting something creative/artistic/genuine or simply new but they should have touched the matrix trilogy... really...The matrix trilogy is a legendary one from so many aspects that revolutionized the film industry and also went so much beyond that even universities were talking about its concept and philosophizing about it.This is just wrong!Everything feels either cheaper or out of canon or halfbaked or all 3.From the colors to the plot, from the actors to the clothes to the dialogues.Especially the dialogues! I mean ok the plot was nothing to write home about (pun intended) but you could descern that from miles away since the plot of the trilogy is complete near to perfection and doesnt allow for this low hanging fruit reboot... But the dialogues... That hurt me more than everything else!The dialogues!!!!In the first 3 iterations out it felt like (and probably was so since you can read pages upon pages analyzing the dialogues) 10 out of lets say 15 words hard a specific purpose to be said like they were said and there couldnt be a better way they had been spoken, everything had an apparent and sometimes a double/hidden meaning as where in ""Matrixy 4"" its mostly blah blah blah blah superficial boring stuff to fill up time...Even the names on the original Matrix had meaning, e.g Morpheus the primal god of dreams the authority to wake you up from them, Cypher originates from Cyphus who was the one (in Greek mythology) that betrayed Morpheus, Trinity as in the christian dogma which combines all three facets of God into one as Trinity in the film is the element that combines all facets of the One and makes him complete which leads to a different Matrix conclusion compared to the previous iterations mentioned in the plot..In ""Matrixy 4"" we have names such as Bugs as in Bugs Bunny!!! No kidding, that's actually why they call one of the ""Matrixy 4"" Characters...It's like the gave it to millennials and told them take them actors and make them ""matrixy"".There was no need for Matrix 4 except for making a fast buck as I said in the title cheapshot and disappointingEven at the first minutes of the movie the nostalgia cheap shot start to surface in the dialogue in the form of repeating epic quotes from the previous movies...Why did you have to do this to the Matrix? Just leave it alone... My eyes can not unsee that.I watched the movie for free but I still couldnt go past a few minutes and I felt that I wanted to be reimbursed for damages.",3
1320,"Like most, the original Matrix blew my mind when I saw it in the theaters. I don't think there will ever be another movie that will have the same effect on me and truly being genre defining. So it's silly to expect it from Matrix Resurrections. They were never shy acknowledging this was in big part fan service and honestly they did well on that end. They also managed to make a decent story, have good action scenes, and get the actors to give it their best shot. Again, it doesn't compare to the original but it's good enough to make you forget Reloaded and Revolutions, and just for that it's a great movie in my book.",7
1321,"I am one of those who grew up in the matrix generation, I have watched the original films countless times as well as the animatrix and I rewatched everything in anticipation for this newest instalment.I had my doubts when I first heard they were making another Matrix and was intrigued as to how Neo and Trinity would return. After watching this newest instalment I don't understand the widespread negativity towards the film. It is done in a unique way which is not cheesy or expected and the plot is different enough from the original films that it feels fresh while still keeping the aesthetics that the fans love.My only issues with the film was that it had way too many flashback scenes of the previous film and the beginning set up took up most of the movie and then the end felt rushed. Overall though I think if you were a fan of the original films you will enjoy this for what it is.",7
1322,"First things first: I know I'm rating this movie higher than average at 9/10 and even I understand the main reason for its existence is that Keanu is at a stage in his life where he's reminiscing about characters he's played in the past and feels the need to relive that character all over again in the present. The fact that this movie came together the way it did is a testament to Keanu for going ALL IN on becoming Neo for 4 years between 1999-2003, and I thought Keanu slid right back into character like a baseball mitt from little league! The nostalgia of the original Matrix trilogy was worth every bit of the ticket price that my date treated me too!To all the naysayers who say ""this movie shouldn't have been done,"" and ""it's just a cash grab,"" etc I say ""There is never enough movies to remind us that TRUE LOVE triumphs over all!"" The chemistry between Keanu and Carrie Anne Moss connects me more to the film than any special effects ever could and for them to still have that same electricity 18 years later totally did it for me! It's a reminder that no matter the odds true love will always find itself. We can do things we never thought possible when it is to keep love alive, and that's not just a Trinity and Neo thing! That goes to all the red pillers and blue pillers alike living together through these unprecedented times: True love is always real! We can overcome any evil in this world when we channel our inner love in order to fight back against that evil!The entire Matrix series is a bit of an enigma in just how liberating the underlying message is. It's no secret that Hollywood for the most part is run by those trying to send controlling sub-concious messages somehow, and teaches principles with the intention of making the viewer confused and weaker somehow, but since the beginning The Matrix has made a point of questioning the Status Quo and those that society has put in positions of public trust! The entire Matrix franchise has me questioning whether or not the world really is working together to fight for the greater good or not? My closest friends and I call ourselves red pillers for this very reason that we believe we are fighting for the greater good and doing everything we can to help wake up all those who matter in our lives to see the truth and see what's really going on! There is a huge difference in being ""Woke"" and being ""Awake"" and from what this movie has taught me taking the red pill is about being ""Fully awake!""The entire cast is really well selected and because of that is able to execute an array of different emotions from suspense to humour and even some tear-jerking moments, but the 2 actors that really stuck out to me was Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who plays a young Morpheus and Jessica Henwick who plays Bugs. Those 2 were really put in the make or break roles of the film and they totally played the roles with more confidence than I expected coming in and made the roles their own! I'll be looking forward to those 2 actors in future films.I'll leave on the note that the action and special effects were great, and for all the throwbacks of the original trilogy there is also a ton of unexpected twists and turns! I give this film a 9/10 and all you red pill taking Matrix fans the 2 and a half hours will fly by and I think you'll love it!",9
1323,"Everything feels wrong in it...the tone of the movie, the color, the feel, the dialogues, characters, fight scene, car chase scene, it almost feels like.....it wanna be a Marvel movie...it wanna milk Matrix like how The Terminator was milked to death!....it is just sad.....again...it was just painfull.",1

1326,"Felt empty and soulless. Story may have worked if there wasn't so many stupid decisions that had no sense from previous movies perspective.No originality that worked yet where they took from previous movies it felt lazy and forced. Filming a scene to look like in original Matrix is not keeping the spirit of the movie. Its ""we know people liked this scene in original so let's use it again"" type of cash grab. But it did not work as most if people in cinema simply shook their heads as did i.Somehow even special effects felt off like that didn't even try. Fighting choreography was half of what i expected from Matrix title.If the original movies didn't exist then this one may have been 7/10 maybe.I left cinema an hour ago and if not for those stupid moments all i would remember would be lack of essence of this movie.",3

1329,It was kind of Lana to warn us before the slaughter of my favorite franchise began by putting a mise en abyme so early with a character explaining how the Warner forced a new trilogy of this movie only for the money.Even if I tend to agree with her I would have much appreciated if I wasn't baited into a war between a director who wants to protect her work of art and a studio hungry for money.,2
1330,"So, I was originally planning on avoiding this movie but I had a few people message me online telling me I had to see it. They enticed me with how it fit my world-view on something - completely trolled into seeing this terrible film.I loved the Matrix trilogy even the cgi that many complained about - I love the Matrix. But Matrix Resurrections was just bad.Neo never picks up a gun, barely fights, and has a new weird power. I was surprised it wasn't woke so I guess that is a plus?? There are so many things that make no sense to the canon created by the other films.With that said what was the whole point of making this film??? There was almost no real conflict. There really wasn't any reason to activate Neo or Trinity because there was perpetual peace and the ones stuck in the Matrix were making that choice!!! So Neo and Trinity are terrorists now?Just more 'member berries and Hollywood just cash grabbing while offering this cheap representation of the art that I saw in the original trilogy. This was just dumb and soulless.",1

I have no idea how the rest of the film went - I too was utterly disinterested and walked out after an hour.For something with an inkling of promise this was garbage. And boring garbage at that. The young supporting cast can't hold a candle to original gang, and are utterly faceless as well. Giving them funky sunglasses and blue hair is the only interesting thing about them.I have never walked out of a film before. Well done Matrix Regurgitations - you've made me break my duck.",1
1333,"Where to begin? Story - A rehash of the original matrix, just to even things up a bit because its 2021.The acting was seriously bad, I mean wooden bad, I mean just plain bad. The one and only bright spot acting wise was when Keanu Reeves was asked to play a more stupid Neo and willingly obliged, thus saving his John Wickness for that franchise. You know its bad when Chad Stahelski's cameo was the standout.Also what on earth was the thinking behind turning the Merovingian into what looks like a Cat-Weasel cider drinking hobo, shouting drunk things from the roadside? I was surprised he wasnt pushing a trolley full of tin cans. Throw in some poor fighting scenes that looked like some old drunks from my local staggering around having a fight and you have the gist of it. As for the swarm, leave that to zombie films please.And Morpheus, you know, the new sassy one, with all the charisma of a carrier bag, who is just shoehorned in to provide the motivation to get Neo believing again...er again. Laurence Fishburne is the one and only Morpheus, why they didn't just retire his name I do not know.Worst of all are the Agent Smith cameos, I mean c'mon the big bad is back and all he does is preen, pull funny faces, fight the same fight sequences and say a few snarky words...and also pops in with an assist because you know, he just does??? I really was hoping that Hugo Weaving would pop on out, slap the new annoying one, apologise to his enemy, laugh manically and get on with being a major protagonist in the film.The Matrix / How I met your future mashup (The Neil Patrick Harris villain is so bad he belongs in a Bond Film) is a shockingly poor movie and it really is just a cynical cash grab that's clinging desperately on to a franchise declining since the sequel to the original Matrix.Here's hoping the resuscitation equipment is handed back for a refund at costco and then we can move on from this botch job.",2
1334,"Beyond disappointing. Honestly 20 minutes in, and my BF and I couldn't decide if the moviemakers were trolling us, or if the movie was really that bad? The director of photography must have come from the USA network, or CBS because the visual feel looks like a hyped up episode of NCIS. Sure, it's fun to see the new cast, but the flashbacks of the previous triology just serve to show off the low quality visuals. The dialogue is painful-it's just all out sad. Don't ruin the original trilogy. Don't waste your time.",2
1335,Honestly this felt something like a long form cheap CW marvel series. It was the ultimate retcon that essentially renders the entire Matrix saga meaningless and is so meta and self-referential that the audience has no hope of becoming immersed in the non existent story. They did to Neo what they did to Luke in the new Star Wars trilogy but at least Disney had the decency to maintain some semblance of cinematic awe and storytelling. I wasn't expecting much from this and it still disappointed.,1
1336,"I love matrix 1 , I love it it's ke of my favourite films of all time , 1999 one year befor the humanity enters a new era it came and changed everything.The beginning, the PHILOSOPHY, The ACTION scene The CHARACKTERS , costume design , art direction make up villains agent SMITH and the tablets , the dialogue, the amazing dialogue 😍😍😍 it changed the way of my lifeWhat happened to all of that ?I mean matrix 2,3 was Okay , not so bad as matrix 4 .The story wants to be nostalgic but it destroys our memories of Neo and Trinity. So many useless flashbacks , so many not understandable dialogues , boring dialogues, boring characters . So untidy scenes . Extremely meaningless action scenes . I'm disappointed and I wish I haven't watched it. At least I had a very beautiful memory of matrix .",3
1337,"I liked the soundtrack, costume designs and Neo's ""insanity"" with the blue pills (the blue pill concept was shown in one of the trailers and it was one of the reasons I got hyped about this movie). Literally everything else about this movie is bland and terrible. I have never slept in a cinema before but I guess I can't say that anymore. As soon as I woke up I wanted the movie to just end.",3

1339,"As a fan of the franchise, this didn't cut it at all.It felt like a made for TV recap. It felt rushed and trying to be several things at once. I was quite bored. There were some cool CGI moments, but nothing significantly memorable.",4
1340,It's really that bad. There's no plot. Nothing makes sense. It's basically just the original matrix horribly rehashed to try and appease people in 2021. If you could use one word to describe the movie it's easy: Cringe.,2
1341,"This movie is what Santa should leave in the stockings of bad children.If beer is proof God loves us and wants us to be happy, this movie is evidence to the contrary.This movie should be played on a loop at Gitmo to elicit confessions.This movie is a new benchmark in bad. As in, ""WWII was bad."" ""Really? Was it as bad as Matrix Resurrections?"" ""No. Nothing's that bad.""While watching Keanu Reeves performance, I kept thinking of Pete Davidson's 'Slacker Chad' character from SNL. It was basically the same character but with ZERO energy. He either responded with one-word answers or no word answers with a stupid look on his face. I turned to my dad about halfway in and asked if he thought Keanu was sedated. I found myself wishing Neo was back in his pod serving as a battery. Batteries have more personality than Neo in this movie.",2
1342,"The cinematography, fight choreography, special effects were for the most part, terrible. It looked and watched like a low budget movie or at best a TV show special. The story was okay in the first act but degenerated as the movie went on. I was going to give it a 5/10 but after it ended I felt like a 3.9/10 was best. Then it sunk in, a 2/10 was best. What a dud compared to the rest of the movies.",2
1343,"All the self-referential callbacks are such a distraction and take you out of the immersion in the movie. They retcon the Matrix trilogy into being a video game series? They couldn't come up with a more interesting premise than that?! In 1 scene, they even say the studios name (Warner Brothers) and ""bullet time"" by name! Tacky. I couldn't understand a word of dialogue from the the blue-haired chick and her British accent felt really out of place. Neo's obnoxious co-worker, was he supposed to be comic relief? What an annoying character.Some particularly cringy moments were NPH's black cat named Deja Vu.. way too on-the-nose, and a lazy callback to the original. Then there's the guy in the elevator with Neo, he says ""I've never been in the presence of a legend before"". So cringe watching these pointless new characters kow-tow to Neo. It's taking fan-service too far.It's also cringy (and boring) how our hero has a therapist. When Neo and Trinity meet in the coffee shop, she mentions how she needs one too. This just makes our heroes look weak. Why normalize people needing therapy? There's so much talking and not enough action. The action scenes have no weight to them because the rules of this dream-world aren't established.The fight scenes weren't as tight as the original, lot of camera cuts and CGI-doubles. What's the point of re-doing scenes from the original with better graphics? It doesn't add anything and it's lazy fan service.There's nothing to ponder in the film. There's no tension. The new characters don't matter and will be forgotten. All the clips from the original film had me asking myself why I'm not just watching it instead. I wasn't expecting this to be on the same level as the 1999 film. But this movie spends all it's time connecting dots to the previous films and doesn't stand on it's own. The sequels were dumb but at least had some fun action scenes. This one doesn't even have that. I don't think COVID is going to be the end of movie theaters. It's garbage cinema and remakes like this. How many times are audiences going to take the bait?",2
1344,Why did they have to do this to the matrix? Straight cheese from the start. It's so bad its funny. I actually don't get how they would ruin a franchise like this... I get that it wasn't made for movie theaters... but maybe don't do it at all then. It's like a fan film.,1
1345,The movie was good because of the fighting scenes and bad because of the music. The music was very annoying but I like the movie. I like the ending because I thought that the analyst was against them but I was wrong he was with them.,6
1346,"Worst movie I remember seing in like 15 years. Completely unwatchable. Please trust me. DO NOT WATCH IT.Keanu looks like he was forced to act. Dialogs, story... omg.",1
1347,"Don't really know what else to say. Usually it would be an essay. But this was absolutely abysmal! I must have watched the trilogy 100 times. Nothing can compare to the original. But this seems like a child has written it during her lunch break while eating dairylee dunkers!Such good promise, great use of cgi, but it just feels so cheesy and forced.I am gutted! Can not believe after all the hype and waiting that this was the finished product! Also given that it came out online in 4K a day before the cinema tells a big story. This will flop.It's no wonder Larry or Hugo didn't want any part of it.The fight scenes are all atrocious. The characterisation is awful and everyone is forgettable. The constant reminders of the originals are annoying and unnecessary and a little insulting to any matrix fan. We don't need everything explaining! We know who agent smith was, we know a few things neo did. We don't need carbon copy repeats of every step of Neo waking up. We def don't need to see a young agent smith using the exact same fighting techniques. Half hour of this film is just pointless flashbacks!The cover of the rage against the machine track at the credits is so annoying!I actually fell asleep after 80 mins. I have never done that! I'm almost Angry this film was released. Lana, step away from leadership. Keanu have some respect for yourself!It's actually ended up being an essay anyway. Who knew?In summary, forget about this film. Wipe it out of ur memory. Watch the original straight after again and calm down.",1
1348,"As someone who grew up, absorbed by the Matrix universe, this film feels like a spoof movie. With unremarkable, Marvel-esque dialogue, a total lack of cutting edge cinematography, and a plot that can't fulfil all it's own ideas. For any fans of The Matrix.... Stick to the trilogy.",3
1349,"Confusing, non-sense remake that offers nothing new to viewers , the story, or the franchise. A pointless movie that was just boring. Terrible, terrible movie. One of the years worst. I sense Razzie noms coming.",1
1350,"First a brief introduction. The original Matrix is one of my favorite movies and certainly in the top 10 movies I've watched the most times in my life. The second part is not bad for me, I think it is a very good action with a few great scenes. The third part was a disappointment to me.I think there was no need to make this fourth part at all. The trilogy ended confusingly, various additional sequels or prequels can only do damage to predecessors. I even entered the viewing with an open mind, ready to ignore the various flaws, after all this is the Matrix though, it can't be that bad. How wrong I was. The film has no value at all. It recycles twenty-year-old things, and why? To get closer to today's audience? To make a new generation Matrix? I really don't understand. I even have a theory that the creators of the original deliberately made a film like this, they made a little mockery just so that the studio wouldn't have a chance to reboot.The film plays on the card of nostalgia, but it only rubbed salt on my wound. The film literally shows some scenes from the first film and that's why I got the opposite effect. Instead of liking this film more (they probably aimed for it with nostalgia), I was overwhelmed with anger because the original film looks much better and nicer than this rubbish, so I appreciate it even more. How is it possible that a film older than 20 years looks so good, has better effects and fight scenes, not to mention certain roles?This film is one big mess of everything, from the story, the characters, the action scenes, the new elements to the confusing ending when I absolutely didn't care about anything.",3
1351,I was really hoping not to have to write this. I'm a huge fan of the series. Mainly the first two. I was hoping this would be a resurrection of the franchise as the title suggests. Sadly not.,2
1352,"This my first review, I usually only absorb a content and reviews. But this part make me sick. This is disrespect for everyone who has at least some kind of warm feelings for the entire trilogy. This film is an embodiment of human greed - this is the only way I can explain why it was filmed, apparently just in order to make money. After the film, my friends and I stood silently and smoked, you know, as if after a funeral. No one said a word. It's terrible. Terrible!I just have two questions. Why was this movie made and why Keanu Reeves was involved in this despite the script.",1
1353,Picked a bad cast for the new actors. Especially the councillor. Absolutely horrendous. Why Keanu agreed to this I will never know. Way to much nostalgia places on his love for trinity. The story line was not deep enough. It did not capture the magnitude of the other films. I was just left feeling like this was a really really poor follow up. They shouldn't have bothered it was appalling.,1
1354,"This Matrix movie is astonishingly disappointing and at times really seems like an SNL parody of the prior movies rather than a sequel--the audience was really ""defrauded"" with this movie.I was a huge fan of the 1st 2 Matrix movies--the 3rd one was no where near as good as the 1st 2 but nonetheless I was really anticipating that this 4th one was going to great but this movie was so bad I really considered just walking out at several points but held on to the bitter end hoping that it would get better and it did not.I would not recommend that anyone waste their time and money seeing this movie in the theater.The concept, script and story line of the movie was a joke. The fight scenes were not that good. Also If they couldnt come up with a better storyline and script for this one they would have been better served just starting out this movie that everything that happened in the 3rd one was a ""dream"" and brought back most--if not all -- of the main actors and actresses from the prior ones.",1
1355,"The original Matrix movie caught lighting in a bottle with a fascinating premise, great casting, an incredible score, and amazing cinematography. The sequels, while not quite as good as the first, still delivered innovative action and (mostly) interesting stories while returning us to a world we were eager to revisit.Sadly, none of the magic remains in this fourth installment, and you never get to return to the Matrix with the characters you love. It's a mishmash of ideas (delivered poorly), none of which reach any satisfying conclusion.Part of the movie appears to be a mockumentary of the original trilogy, replete with cringe-worthy bro-humor and equally distasteful characters. None of it is funny, just boring and a waste of time. And lest you think it an afterthought, and not the result of many intentional decisions by people who thought it *was* funny, the post-credit scene delivers more of this banal humor to confirm your utter disappointment with the last two and a half hours of your life.Some of the movie simply plays homage to the original trilogy, repeating various former beats and scenes in a much less interesting way. Perhaps the intent was just fan service, or to try and tie new actors to their former characters, or just show how weak and confused Neo had become. None of it is satisfying though. Personally, it made me sad as I watched and realized the movie I had looked forward to seeing will never exist.The rest of the movie is a sort of a rushed romance-action-heist where two former lovers struggle to get back together. Unfortunately, there's no originality, no innovation, and not nearly enough screen time left (once things finally get moving) for it to play out in any satisfying way.I certainly won't watch this movie again. In fact, I'll try to pretend it doesn't exist, just like Highlander II doesn't exist. Honestly, I can't figure out why this movie was made, other than as a cash-grab. I truly hope WB isn't planning to make more of these; it will just bring a Star Wars level of sadness and disappointment to the whole franchise.",1
1356,I see there are a few poor reviews but those reviews are from people who never believed in the original Matrix message or are too young to have appreciated the message. The movies were always focused on the ultimate question we must all ask ourselves. What is more important to you? Freedom or safety and comfort? This movie asks the same question and Neo and Trinity welcome a new opportunity to fight for freedom. The Matrix is more sophisticated in this move and Lana Wachowski brought along a number of cast members from Sense 8 which was a pleasant surprise. They did a great job aging Jada Smith so she could be Niobe again and making her the establishment character who prefers peace and comfort to freedom. To her it is fine that most of humanity will never know the tiny space of peace and freedom she enjoys. I'm impressed with everything about how the movie was written and presented. There's a new Morpheus and Smith but it all flows well. They left it so that other movies might be made or not. Either way I'm satisfied that the Matrix franchise maintained its integrity. Bravo!,9
1357,"It's less than a movie on its own and more like an epilogue to the trilogy, that could have been much shorter.The script tries to be intellectual, but fails as bad a Nolan's Tenet, and maybe that's why the wife and I could never connect with it.It's like the story never really start, and because of that you end up feeling nothing with the new characters, you only relate with Neo And Trinity, but it's a weak connection. Keanu, Carrie and Henwick are the ones that make it a more interesting movie, but it's hard with so much 'meh' around.The fights are mostly bad, like they didn't know how it was made on the other movies.The only good thing is the reunion between Neo and Trinity and how good they look on the screen. There is nothing more to see here.",4
1358,"If i had chance to turn back on time and forget something i watch , this would be one of the picks i would choose . Unfortunately the script is terrible and i really feel myself sad to watch this movie and spend my time for this . I usually don't make such a harsh critism about a movie but this soo called the movie we hyped for is a total failure .",1
1359,"Its astounding that something could be so awful. It bears no resemblance to the originals, yet doesn't have a single original scene, a truly remarkable accomplishment. There must be an AI program that does some sorta cost analysis to determine which movies get funding without actually reading the script. If this landed on my desk I woulda said: 'Oh cool, Matrix 1, if it sucked.'",1
1360,"Why did they release this movie and why did Keanu and Carrie-Anne accept this nonsense of a script. Matrix was so much more than this BS.I'm really disappointed. I wish I never saw this.The worst is they had a golden opportunity to make something amazing but they didn't and this can't be fixed. Acting was average and I believe it wasn't the actors fault, but the horrible script they received. From the best Sci-fi movie to the worst and it only took them 20 years...",3
1361,"I thought The Matrix Revolutions was bad (though not completely), but here's the new worst Matrix. It's completely unnecessary, its story is useless and pointless, there's no interesting and inventive action scenes, the cinematography sucks, the actors are almost completely miscast. This film lost the original films' atmosphere and is no longer revolutionary for the industry. Resurrections is just not interesting to watch - there's its most prominent drawback. I'm happy that for Lana Wachowski it was a relief from the depression, but for us - the viewers, this film is a torture to watch. I thought that when the original creators of any movie series return to them, it should be a good sign, but not in this case. If you're planning on going to the cinema to watch The Matrix Resurrections, don't do it. It doesn't worth your time and money. Better rewatch the old movies, even if you dislike the second and/or the third.",5
1362,"I watched this movie with low expectations and somehow still got disappointed. If you thought that the second and the third totally butchered the masterpiece that is ""The Matrix"" wait until you watch this one. Where are the illusory imagery to philosophical allegories, religious doctrines and new revolutionary cinematographic techniques? Why keep beating a dead-horse and keep trying to reboot a classic by adding nothing to it? If you are going to ruin a classic at least make it fun to watch.",1
1363,"I really don't understand the terrible reviews people are giving this film. Perhaps they expected too much? Did you see the 2nd and 3rd film in the series!? They were increasingly disappointing so we know that a new Matrix film is never going to reach the heights of the original. For me this new film is either as good as or better than Reloaded, the better of the two sequels.Just be grateful that you have a new Matrix film for goodness sake. And even better than that, it's actually quite good. Yes it's imperfect in many ways but i was not bored for one second during this film. That is something I can't say for the latest Spiderman film or most films in fact. Yes, it's partially a recycling of the first film but it does it in such a fun and inventive way. It has to, Neo and Trinity are somehow still alive after all and how can the world they now inhabit be explained? Weren't they liberated from the Matrix in the first film?There's a lot of self-reference at the start of the film, almost 4th wall breaking, I don't think I've ever seen that in a film like this. Lots of winks and nods and even divulging of real-life information to the audience. The film almost fools you into questioning the whole premise of the entire franchise. That's quite unexpected and again just flipping fun! There is a lot of double meaning in much of the film, some is a little close to the bone and some was completely over my head. There is so much in this film which is an allegory for something else, more so than any of the original films. That's what makes it arguably even more philosophical than the original. Perhaps it gets a little preachy at times, but it didn't bother me at all. It actually challenged me in many ways personally. And that is one of the main reasons people don't like this film. They feel personally offended! I find that hilarious though because that is just defensiveness. Which proves that the points are hitting a nerve.Some people have described this film as a convoluted mess. I would somewhat agree but I actually see that as a strength. It throws so much at you so quickly that you can't absorb it all but that's OK! That's part of the fun! Maybe it doesn't makes total sense, but who cares when the narrative drives along at breakneck speed and you're having so much fun.I enjoyed all the performances but especially Carrie Ann Moss. Unfortunately she's in it too little. Neil Patrick Harris looks like he's having stacks of fun with his character.Now for the only thing that disappointed me: the martial arts choreography and action scenes. They are decent, at times great, but generally they aren't up to the standard of previous films. It's all a little choppy and the camera work is either sloppy or too close so you can't see clearly what is going on. Very little of the beautiful and effective martial arts of the first two films is present. Occasionally it looked a little rehashed if I'm honest.All in all I recommend this new Matrix film. Don't expect perfection and don't expect the brilliance of the first film. Just enjoy it for it is: a lucky chance to re-enter the world of the Matrix under the direction of one of the original creators. Don't listen to the naysayers.",8
1364,"The Wachowskis fooled us again. Not only did they take my money, they took time out of my life to watch this hot utopian garbage. I mean really, i paid someone to basically torture my intelligence for over two hours.This movie is a mess. I appreciate the idea behind it, I understand what they were trying to do. But the follow thru and writing just weren't there. Save your money and go see spiderman.",4
1365,"Horrible story.Horrible actors.This movie feels like a fan made film rather than a Hollywood flick. Casting is one of the worse I have ever seen. Morpheus was horrible, Smith was even worse and neil patrick Harris as a villain was a joke. Hugo weaving should have been recasted. There was no intimidation in the entire movie. Everyone was going in and out of the matrix like Disneyland.The concept of THE ONE is now changed to THE COUPLE. And for some reason trinity is now more powerful than neo. Neo only has only one power of ""the force field"" and that's it?All the other actors than Keanu and Carrie Ann moss were just terrible, I think in secondary characters only priyanka did a decent acting job as sati.Whole movie was a waste of time.",4
1366,"The best Part of The Matrix was the revolutionizing of Action sequence in the Cinema history. And the opening scene of matrix resurrection just gives you the vibes tht its ruined for ever. I don't know was WB low on budget or just using John wicks profile to make money out of it. I rewatch the matrix trilogy every now and then, but this one was the first and last sequal I will ever watch.",2
1367,Not what i expected nothing special scène fight are short and where is the power of the one !!!! He can't even fight a bunch of cops or swarms!!!.I'm so disappointed 😞.Over 20 years matrix was a legend to be destroyed in 2 hours 28 min !!!!!,4
1368,"I expected a slight desastre, like the third one, but I got such a convoluted, story-less, pseudo-deep but simultaneously super superficial movie, I could barely stand it. Really not worth your money at all. Don't go see it, stand up against hollywood continuously feeding us lousy-heartless spin-offs of franchises we once loved just for the money.",1
1369,"When you are desperate to make a movie, but totally lack any ideas. So half the time you recreate scenes from the original and the other half you unabashedly show the actual footage.When you want old, loved characters to show up, but your inserts lack the presence of Lawrence Fishbourne and charisma of Hugo Weaving. And dyeing hair blue is a substitute for having any character at all.I give you - Matrix: Resurrections.Neo - you should have stayed dead.Keanu - you deserve better.P. S First ""John Wick"" had batter fighting scenes...",2
1370,Big budget cash grab. No heart. No new themes. This is the fifth worst Matrix movie and they've only made 4 of them. Unoriginal. Uninspired. Baaaaaaad directing. Weak script and story.,2
1371,"I watched the movie in a cinema with four junkies two rows ahead of me and the only time I could sympathize with them was when they shouted ""YOU KILLED THE MATRIX B******S"" at the end of the movie. This might be one of the few movies/shows/series in human history which was bad enough to force me to come all the way to here and drop a comment.Oh wow, I don't know what to say. Some of the most grounded and developed characters in the previous movies were replaced by their parody versions which act like space fillers:Agent Smith: Evolves from a omnipotent virus bent on destruction of all matrix and ""parasite"" humans into an American fraternity brother who is hard on the outside but soft in the inside. Despite hating Neo's guts and all he represents, he steps in last minute to kill the architect (because he hates the architect more?), saves Neo, Trinity high five them, approve of their love and disappear.Morpheus: For some reason the Morpheus built from memories of Neo is an amalgamation of old Morpheus and Agent Smith (spoiler: he neither looks or behaves like any of them). This story branch which they introduced lasts about a couple of minutes before disappearing into the void that it came from, having no effect what so ever on the plot. And then suddenly by just speaking to one woman for 5 seconds this badly constructed amalgamation turns into the comic relief of the movie. I wonder which genius' idea was it to turn the most charismatic character of the previous films into a comic relief character.Like above, the film is full of dangling story branches which are thrown around, makes no sense and would probably break the plot if you tried to develop them further. Who the hell are the superiors that the new architect has to answer to, which we only hear about in the passing for about a second? Why the hell do we randomly learn that Neo looks different to himself as opposed how other people see him and nobody talks about this ever again? Why does Neo get forcefully confined in Io for only 5 seconds? Similarly a lot of super vague stuff about the simulation modal which seems to be critical to the movie plot but is never developed much beyond Neo bashing on his terminal and getting anxious over some problems which not really revealed to the audience. Whoever wrote the story thought they could compress tens of undeveloped, not very well thought out raw ideas into 2 hours and miserably failed.Nothing about this movie is in the same spirit as its prequels. The movie is full of absurd jokes that breaks the fourth fall which turns the movie into a parody of itself. I am also sorry to say that after 20 years of technological advancements, this movie also does not add much visually on tops of the prequels. Sure maybe graphical effects are a bit better and such but since they haven't managed to capture the dark punk post apocalyptic atmosphere of the matrix world as successfully as previous films it doesn't add much.I don't even consider my self a matrix fan(atic) but this movie genuinely made me feel sad. People call it progressive, I would not agree. Yes it tries to greatly change the tone of the previous movies, possibly in an attempt to make it more attractive to the younger generations. But it fails to add any progress, it just creates something different (and in my opinion of lower quality then the previous movies) and calls it matrix for the revenue.",2
1372,"Completely ruined Matrix for me.Characters aren't the sameNo gun fights I thought with that John Wick look we'd atleast see some John wick style of action combined in the matrix with super powers, nope none of that just neo stopping the bulletsMade a joke out of Morpheus .. there's a lot more wrong and it sucked.",2
1373,The first 30+ minutes were different (not necessarily a bad thing) but were so slow. I liked the new characters but Agent Smith was a huge letdown. Nothing against Groff but Hugo was such a strong presence he's hard to replace. The whole storyline was unfortunately completely garbage. Close shot action scenes that were hard to follow and nostalgia flashbacks that missed the point and just became annoying. I think a 5* is generous. I have no intention of rewatching this movie in the future. Thank god I only spent $5 to see it.,5
1374,"""we wanted peace and they wanted purge""let that sentence sink in for a moment. The words uttered by a crippled and clueless neo, sixty years in the future. This movie is so inconsistent with the original matrix plot, morpeous is a completely different person, yet in the flashbacks the audience is forced to view every five minutes or so, Lawrence Fishburne is playing the character, and we have no explanation as to why he looks different. Neo is cast as the hero, yet takes no initiative to escape the matrix, and even results to attempting to run away from morpheous when offered the chance to leave. Smith is BACK (and in a different body) even though Neo very much killed him at the end of the third movie. ( the flashbacks to the original actor when they cut to smith is infuriating btw) Jada Pinkett Smith was WRONGED. She looks absolutely horrendous and what was with the scene where neo eats a strawberry and she smiles like it added nothing to the plot line. This movie sucks, and was probably made by agents. Thank you for your time and don't watch this garbage.",1
1375,"What the F did i just watch !!! This is just so bad it must be a joke.Could not wait to watch this movie after seeing the trailers, loved the original trilogy and after recently re-watching them they still hold up as some of the best action/sci fi movies about but not this one...Worst story , pointless and feels really unnecessary, no high stakes tension of the original, not one decent fight scene, takes a giant dump on the original which from the first half of the movie didnt even happen!! It was a computer game (which we see on screen numerous times)Agent smith is laughable compared to menacing villian he was.Floating baby robot manta ray thing -give me a break!Honestly it felt like watching a made for TV movie, disappointed is an understatement.There are some good points..amazing colour and visuals and the Jefferson Airplane ""white rabbit"" track rocks.",1
1376,"Going meta is not necessarily a bad thing, but when you show the actual scenes of the original matrix trilogy in the movie while rehashing the same lines, you can't help but cringe. I haven't cringed this hard while watching a movie since Justice League.The choreography is horrendous. Most of the fighting scenes in this movie include cut after cut, and just about every punch and kick does not connect and is visibly jarring how fake it is. Also, I don't know if it's because Keanu can't pull it off, but ""The One's"" powers seem to have been reduced to force shield barrier and freezing bullets and not much else.The story seems to focus on the power of love. I guess it could have been interesting, but it comes off cheesy and forced. Our main protagonists seem almost irrelevant to the plot by the time the movie finishes because the real world doesn't seem to be in any danger and the Matrix world itself is run by incompetent AI and woke and middle aged, apathetic people by the time the credits role.Return to the source? If by source you mean cash grabbing Hollywood, then to the source you have returned.",2
1377,"Should never have created another sequel and left it with the last one. Nice special effects but that is all. Weak, boring, and pointless storyline got bored after the first 30 mins and really is the same old predicable stuff with some of same actors just older.",3
1378,"So disappointed by this movie. What on earth, yes the visuals was nice but the story was just shamefully stitched together. It is so bad that it ruins the original trilogy which made me wish I had never seen this cash cow remake. Nothing in it was compelling and the first hour is a snooze fest.",1
1379,"I loved the original Matrix, and even managed to sit through the sequels a couple of times each, but this was just painful.Firstly, it looks terrible. I'm assuming it's shot digitally because everything looks like it's from a low-budget soap opera. The costume design is also hideous. I get that black trench coats and PVC have had their day, but the garish and ugly suits they put ""Morpheus"" in are not an upgrade.Also, the constant inserts of scenes from the previous movies is just irritating. It's like someone going through a gallery of stills and nudging you, saying ""Remember this bit? Oh, what about this part, wasn't that cool?""If you're story cannot stand on it's own, without a low-effort PowerPoint presentation running in the background, then I think it's probably not a story worth telling.",3
1380,"I was so eager for this movie. And probably that is why it seemed like a letdown to me.The movie plays with The Matrix world but it lost all the charms it had 20 years ago.Even Keanu as Neo didn't has the same dynamic anymore.The movie did a bad job in every aspect whether it is direction, storyline, characters, cinematography, etc.The action sequences was decent at best.Matrix 2 was so amazing with action and now after 18 years this is the one thing in which they could do a really good job but it was so bad that it felt like watching a TV series rather than a movie in some scenes.New Morpheus was not serious but kinda like cranky. New agent smith was somewhat watchable also Neil did a good job as an antagonist who was not powerful.Plot was so loose that they didn't offer anything good to the story.Overall, it was not upto a good movie standard let alone considering it a Matrix part.Hope they don't repeat it ever again.",6
1381,"The entire movie feels like ""the making of a music video"", only that the music is bad, the acting is worse, the script even worser (? If you can say that in English), ... and a clear wind-up of former matrix fans. Because IF you are a matrix fan, don't ... never ... no ... do not give money for this charade and the maker. Just boycott it!I chose the word ""persiflage"" for the title of the review of ""The Matrix Resurrections"", because this happens to every group of elder actors, who maybe come together one weekend to spend some time and eat and drink good vine and talk about the good old times, bla bla bla, and when they got drunk enough they all decide to resurrect matrix one more time, just to kill it together with the fans of the trilogy. In German we say ""Schnapsidee"" (sound nice, but is not really a good idea).Here is my appeal to the producer: Please don't do this to the audience, it is not what they payed for. Just leave the industry and let other people make better movies. You seem to have lost definitely your mojo.",1
1382,"Reading the reviews it seems like people had extremely high hopes for this movie.I did also but i didn't have expectations. This day and age you have no idea what they are going to try to do.Considering a 4th movie shouldn't have been made, I'm happy. Im a gluten for punishment I guess. This movie is a 4th. Not a first. It impossible to be more original than the original idea of the first.I'll warn you; this is a straight up love story more so than the other 3. I'm fine with that. Thought the movie was not original but original enough and was the only way they could have done a 4th.Movie reviewers seem have no tolerance and expect perfection. I enjoyed it but I'm actually forgiving to a degree.",1
1383,"Being a Matrix fan from the beginning, I genuinely looked forward to the experience of appreciating and enjoying Matrix Resurrections.Initially I couldn't finish it, but I restarted the movie the next day, and confirmed my observations.Instead of the often dark edginess of the Matrix universe, this ""sequel"" is as if someone had the bright idea to have a diverse team of actors perform the same or similar actions and stunts of the previous Matrix movies, and then construct a movie around them.The plot is convoluted and as chaotic as the action sequences. This is not as entertaining or satisfying to watch without the investment of ongoing context and progression of the characters and plot, and makes Resurrections a parody of the previous Matrix movies.Also parody-like and distracting, are the new, younger Morpheus (can you imagine Morpheus dancing a little jig?) and also the new, younger character playing Mr. Smith (who, for some reason I can't take seriously, without that sense of danger and impending doom of the previous Smith). Parodies.I understand that telephone booths and landlines are not as prevalent in our society as before, but to change the dynamic suspense of characters searching for these as escape routes into merely opening a door seems spawned from unimaginative writing, dumbing these actions down for a new generation. I'm sure that another method could have been imagined (merely opening a door is not progress; it feels lazy).Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss reprise their roles apparently so the word ""Matrix"" could be added to the title, and to provide a little coherence to the plot and characters. Jada Pinkett-Smith is also back, but Jada Pinkettts' horrendous makeup (is she molting?) cancels out her performance.In reawakening and freeing Trinity, Sati says ""...it must be her choice "". But Neo's ""choice"" wasn't considered before he was freed. Sort of reminds me of...never mind, I digress.Matrix Resurrections is a substandard, watered down version of the previous, a caricature as well as a parody. And please note that even though diversity is a good thing, adding more diversity simply for the sake of diversity is not always a good thing. Especially with a stinker.",1
1384,"Over an hour of meaningless fourth-wall breaking to appeal to some buried nostalgia. The rest is just badly scripted and directed action, with no rhyme or reason for most of what's happening.Keep your memories safe and re-watch the originals.",3
1385,"It opens to a meta memory play by play.I thought it was going to proceed in a good direction, but it suddenly became Neo meets trinity in a You've got mail sequence. Everything about the Matrix original turns to a meta universe they are pertaining to as a video game. Neo is not Neo but is being asked to be someone else.It feels like an overspent actor/actress/director who's at the last string before falling off the grid.This is a story someone threw in the garbage and got picked up.Should have stayed there.So bad and easily forgettable. Should not be a part of the Matrix saga.",1
1386,"Matrix is a psychological cyberpunk movie, targeted for adults, an analogy to modern society and supposedly make you question reality. Not matrix resurrection. This is essentially space jam 2 into the matrix. What's wrong with you Warner Bros? What is this new cheesie trend of calling out your name in the movie? The quality of the dialogs has been lowered so they can target 3/5 years old. Fist bumps with tiny robots? What is this? Wallie? I will never watch anything from Warner Bros ever again.",1
1387,"They really should have stopped at the first film. Like the other two sequels, this film was boring, flat, confusing, pointless and quite frankly, awful.",3
1388,"This film is garbage. Don't waste your time. I don't know why they made it, the film doesn't REALLY have a story, it's just a rehash of the first one but they're not trying to do anything.",1
1389,"The similarities to this and The Force Awakens are striking. It's incredible that it replays a majority of the events from the first film, only worse. The CGI looks terrible, even worse because you're having to watch scenes from the original movie that look terrible. The fighting sequences, framing, direction were terrible.The lore also suffered here, most of the explanations were indigestible. Just a terrible movie all around and a big nothing burger.",1
1390,"We've been expecting the same level of commitment and creativity which experienced 20 years ago. It was our favorit movie; NO,actually it was our reference to a good movie. Lana , with all love and repect, this is the wrost job you have done in your career . You were able to destroy a legendary piece of art by rushing to release such a movie. Thank you for the effort, but nah , not even close.",2
1391,I liked the meta elements in the first half but then once the real plot kicks in it kind of lost me. The new characters and action scenes feel like something out of a bad Divergent movie. It's also pretty cynical about the past films and the idea of sequels in general. The only part so liked was the new character Bugs. Otherwise this was very disappointing.,4
1392,"Even though the nostalgia can be too much and heavy handed at times, the Matrix Resurrections is the best Matrix sequel so far, an appropriately meta, stylish and surprisingly funny film that's also got plenty of heart and interesting new ideas.Keanu Reeves gives an incredible lead performance with plenty of charm and is once again able to anchor the film's more surreal and pretentious moments. Carrie-Anne Moss is great and has strong chemistry with Keanu. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is effortlessly cool and suave and Jessica Henwick gives the best performance out of the new characters.Lana Wachowski's direction is really good, it's visually slick with well filmed action set pieces, even if they aren't as satisfyingly clean as the previous ones. The CG is mostly impressive and the music by Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer is also really good, less hi-tech sounding than the previous ones.",7
1393,"But instead of the normal 10 stars Matrix 1, 2 and 3 would receive, this one is lacking due to:taking over half the movie just to explain things (and I still don't understand)introducing too many new gadgets, portals, words, robots etc. Never really explaining the good/bad robots - how does anyone know?Neo was kind of a weak character, not the ONE as he was in the past.But, it was nice seeing what happened to some of the older characters who had been around awhile - and where they are today. I thought it was funny!RECOMMEND: It's worth a watch, but NOT at movie theater ticket prices. Either get HBO MAX for a month, or wait until you can rent streaming.",7
1394,A mediocre script wasted by horrible execution.I won't be surprised if visuals were wasted on purpose to fail the movie so WB won't make more sequels from it. Maybe Lana tries to bury the franchise telling in her meta-commentary why this film is what it is.,4
1395,"Something is off about this movie, the story is not bad but execution wise it feels rushed, the pacing is off, the choreography soooo much worse than the original, the cast, clothes, it seriously feels like a B movie. Such a shame, if they had only stuck to the style of the original without having the urge to ""innovate"".",5
1396,The movie completely destroys the charm and beauty of the trilogy.Senseless storyline and forced dialogues. You can no more connect with the characters.Wish they never made this sequel.,1
1397,"What should have stopped at one movie has now become four... or maybe 3.5It's awful in almost every regard.There's far too much exposition and poor attempts to be meta, far too little coherent story, bland acting, no gravity or consequence to any of the action. It all just feels utterly hollow, pointless, and soulless.It feels like they are trying to go back and undo the first movie - the only legitimately good one of the lot.Fans will no doubt sling around the lazy and condescending 'but you just don't get it' in defense of this movie, much as they did with entries 2 and 3. But I, and many others got everything we needed to get from the first movie, without the need of the explanatory essays and redactions of 2, 3, and 4.One of the big problems is that matrix 4 doesn't get it. It feels like a movie based on a matrix video game directed by Ewe Boll, if he had a decent budget.I understand what they were trying to do here, but South Park did the same thing much better with Insheeption over a decade ago.",3
1398,"The wrong Wachowski made this apparently. This was NOT for the fans, and there are so many fans! How did this get by so many people! It followed no rules, not even matrix rules. NO SENSE. And why was it funny??????The Matrix trilogy blows your mind with connections, this one blows your mind with all the things that don't connect. I don't understand how tf this entire film could have happened considering it was written and directed by Lana Wachowski.",2
1399,"This movie was the worst of the Matrix movies by a long shot.Morpheus and Smith were replaced by pretty boys with no depth and not even a fraction of the acting skills of Lawrence Fishbourne and Hugo Weaving, respectively.I have not found a reason why Fishbourne was not invited back. Weaving says that it was a scheduling problem that kept him out of the film - Wachowski says she could not wait. Because, you know with eighteen years between films 3 and 4, clearly they were on a tight schedule.Matrix used to be renowned for its fight sequences. This movie's fights are ridiculously obvious shadowboxing that appear to have not even been touched up - you can see them missing contact.The Matrix itself used to take on a greenish hue that showed its harsh reality with kinked out fetish bars on full display. The new version has a full color glowing feeling of a rom-com with cozy coffee dates replacing the edgy night clubs.There is some short commentary about humanity preferring a prettier, yet harsher reality, and fantasizing about getting away from it. I found this to be a nice notion but it was a singular gem in a mountain of feces.Finally, the abandonment of the concept of ""The One."" In this film, Neo says that he never believed that he was ""The One,"" and that it was Trinity's belief that made him strong.This flies in the face of the whole story of ""The One."" The Oracle talks about the key to being The One is to ""Know Thyself."" When Trinity doesn't understand why Neo would stand up to Smith in the first movie, Morpheus explains that he is ""beginning to believe."" In what should have been the final movie, Neo tells the Machines that he alone can defeat Smith. ""And if you fail?"" they ask. ""I won't"" Neo responds. These are the words of someone who believes in himself.Lana Wachowski has allowed her transition to female to kill the whole concept of ""The One."" ""The One"" is now ""the Female Led Couple."" Don't get me wrong, I am not against Female Led Couples or Transfolks. Your Kink is your kink and your truth is your truth. But Lana could have lived her truth without ruining the Matrix story.One star each for Reeves and Moss doing their best with a terrible project.",2
1400,"This movie is objectively bad. It's almost like the mentally ill, now they've been accepted in society rather than being treated, are turning cinema insane. The original matrix is the only one you should watch.. this woketrix is awful.",3
1401,"I spent three days catching up on ""The Matrix"" and it's sequels, watching one each day with an eye toward 'Resurrections'. With that title, it was correct to infer that the film would have something to do with bringing back Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss); it just remained to be seen how the film makers were going to do it. I thought the picture started out rather imaginatively with the way it spoofed the trilogy, though if you've seen it already, you'll definitely get the impression that what went before was nothing more than a virtual reality construct developed by Thomas Anderson in his role as a game developer. In a way, that was a let down, because the original 'Matrix' did break new ground for sci-fi movies with it's stunning visuals and unique concepts, and you felt like the first film shouldn't have been tampered with. With 'Reloaded'; and 'Revolutions' it was quite a different story as the whole reality/Matrix concept got so convoluted you couldn't tell which end was up.So it was with a little bit of pain that what followed the opening of this story reverted back to the kind of mind games played with the sequel films. It began with Neo stating to Bugs (Jessica Henwick) - ""I don't know how to know"". With that, I thought 'here we go again', and that sentiment was pretty much correct. Visually of course, the picture makes the most of it's reliance on CGI and special effects, introducing new machines with names like those found in ""Star Wars"". Here we had robot characters like Cybebe, Octacles and Lumin8, with a later appearance by a big metal bird called Kujaku. Fortunately, their presence wasn't overdone with minimal screen time.But when it comes to science fiction gobbledy-gook, this one outshone the previous flicks toward the finale when Sati (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) laid out her plan to revive Tiffany/Trinity. With a legion of Sentinels sealing off the passages used to rescue Neo, the team from Io had to infiltrate fifty meters below the Anomaleum to a stratum of amniotic fibers. There, a small hexagonal vent fed the air intake into a corpuscular modifier, which oxygenated the bio-gel in Neo's pod. Once inside Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) had to use the System Operator to open the devacuator line and disengage the macerators. Piece of cake, right? There might have been an easier way, but I couldn't think of one.I think I speak for a multitude of movie viewers who feel this self described M-IV was probably unnecessary to complement the franchise. Thinking about it too much would likely require the services of an Analyst like Doogie Howser, er, Neil Patrick Harris. If you're of a mind to sit it out through all the closing credits, you'll find a Marvel-like postscript at the very end that further spoofs the entire movie, but as for me, I won't be watching ""The Catrix"".",7
1402,"TL;DR: Save your money (or your bandwidth)! This is a shameless cash grab.This joke of a movie shouldn't exist. It's repetitive &amp; boring beyond belief, the acting is mediocre and the script is ordinary.If you watch it for some mindless entertainment, it may work for you - but this has nothing in common with the Matrix franchise as you remember it.",2
1403,"Watched The Matrix Resurrections with Keanu Reeves(The Matrix,John Wick Chapter 3-Parabellum)as Thomas Anderson/ Neo, Carrie Anne-Moss(Ironfist) as Trinity, Yahya Abdul-Mateen(Aquaman) as Morpheus , Jessica Yu-Li Henwick(Star Wars:The Force Awakens,Game Of Thrones) as Bugs, Jonathan Groff(Frozen II, Hamilton) as Smith, Priyanka Chopra Jonas(We Can Be Heroes) as Sati,Jada Pinkett Smith(The Matrix Reloaded) as General Niobe, Lambert Wilson(The Matrix Revolutions) as The Merovingian And Neil Patrick Harris(Starship Troopers) as The Analyst.I will say this film isnt good as I hope it would be it did sait my Cyberpunk appetite for 2021 also Keanu still has it and there for The Keanussance is still ago as Neo but the breakout character was Henwicks who was basically the audience us experiencing The Matrix for the first time also NPH The Analyst was great as the films villain also succeeding The Architect from the previous I did enjoy the New Lore also establishing the Previous was all in 90's Modal but it almost lost me when it was too on the nose like Space Jam: A New Legacy but breaking the fourth wall Not as A Good as The Original Or Reloaded but better Than Revolution and decent Cyberpunk Film.Amazing Music By Tom Tykwer(Run Lola Run) &amp; Johnny Klimek(A Hologram For A King) Themes by Don Davis(Universal Soldier:The Return), Cinematography By John Toll(The Shape Of Water) &amp; Daniele Massaccesi(Cloud Atlas) , and Direction By Lana Wachowski(Sense 8) Not A Good As The Original or Reloaded Better Than Revolutions Decent Cyberpunk Film 8/10.",8
1404,"Exactly what I expected from a 2021 reboot of a classic. I'm at peace with the fact that all our male action heroes are being replaced with gender/racially ambiguous blue-haired women.

But even that won't cut the mustard in 2021/22, apparentlyDon't waste your time watching this movie unless you enjoy having LBGTQMNOP£-_+#- being overtones and having a classic ruined for you.",2

1411,"The first act has Lana Wachowski address her own mental worries and issues through Neo, and builds a terrible foundation in which to launch the movie from.Plot holes galore, with an ending that just doesn't make any sense.Such a shame. This could have been something epic. Instead I feel liking drinking bleach to wash my body as so feel disgusted and ridiculous frustrated after watching it.What I did like was watching the guys from Sense 8. Plus Jessica who played Bugs was great.",1
1412,"First, I love the Matrix and keep rewatching the trilogy like a ritual, but I hate this one much enough to spend time to write a review for the first time ever.There is no unity in this film in terms of plot. It's like they tried to put every bit of this and that together for the sake of reminiscing good old times or the fear that watchers won't remember the details? I don't know why but that ruined the film and the trilogy too because of the effort to renew this franchise. If years have passed and the characters and the Matrix have to grow up/be upgraded, at least have some consistency or some creativity. The Matrix trilogy stood out in its time and even today because it is very well-designed and heavily stylised in every bit of the film, but this new film is so poorly executed. It's like they didn't even bother to design any action scenes or even hire a better special effect artists to make Nirobi look old properly.Some characters are brought back for what, that I also don't know. Too make flashbacks are used and old details are used, like the blue and red spills, redundant use of the black cat. I don't know how to say or cover how this is so poorly made, but to sum it up, there is no style to this Matrix. It's so tacky it feels like no one paid attention to the making of this. Even Neo and Trinity have zero chemistry now. Neo is actually too old to fight this, instead of creating a good script to make some joke out of this, they managed to only get one joke right, when he couldn't fly. And that's it.I'm so angry because I waited years to see this, and they didn't deliver which is bad enough. To worsen this, they managed to ruin the concept of 'the one' in this film. So many things could have been done to make the film right. It's not bad to want to renew this, but it didn't have to be like this or felt this forceful. I wanted to walk out half way but I already bought the tickets so what else could I have done except finishing it.There is also too much talking, too much recycling old scenes, old jokes, old bullet stopping bs. Neo couldn't do anything new here except using the hand gestures to fight like Doctor Strange..They didn't even have one scene that Neo looks cool here. The disappointment goes on and on.I hope they stop making more Matrix films if this is their standard, for the sake of fans.",2
1413,"Smells bad too. Flush it fast! Becasue it smells, like its up its own ass, because it totally is.This is the best review you will ever read, trust me.",2
1414,"I loved the matrix, it meant so much to me growing up, i loved all the matrix movies and games and stories so much.I was looking forward to seeing this.But it was horrible. If you like the matrix i warn you to not watch it, it will make you hate the whole universe. This movie ruined the matrix universe to me. I wish i never saw it.",1
1415,"My metric is, behind the sequels so good, would I watch the Matrix 4 again?I kept on along myself this while watching the movie.My answer is not only NO, but I also want to forget the movie even existed in the first place. This movie was a bad joke.What a complete disgrace.",2
1416,The movie was awful. The attention to detail of all the other movies was missing the soundtrack was bad and it seemed like a very low effort movie who all that it had going for it was its prequels.,2
1417,"Id give this an 11/10 if it went that high. Grew up with the originals. Wore out the 10 disc ultimate collection. Went into this blind and was completely blown away. Decades of god awful reboots, sequels, and terrible cash grabs this was such a refreshing update! Everything felt so new yet so familiar. You completely feel like Neo. Confused and dazed in the beginning and them everything is so brilliantly and expertly revealed and expanded. On the edge of my seat and completely absorbed from start to finish. Best movie Ive seen in probably 10+ years! Really hope they continue the story! Worth the ~20 year wait!",10

1419,"We tried it for about 15 minutes last night, then quit. We couldn't figure how the modern characters were relevant or connected to the trilogy. Why did they even make this movie?",3
1420,"Dear Lana Wachowski,I get it. You were forced to make a sequel and you knew someone else would have done it if you refused, so you tried really hard to make a very awful, pathetic and cringy movie to stop people from wanting to extend what is already great, and to slap the studio's face. I can imagine this was a big sacrifice because most of the people would think you just went crazy. This was warned since the beginning when Neo was talking to Smith, and Smith said all those things about the studio forcing to do a sequel despite your own opposition. So, I hope this is it, and I hope more people understand what is really going on with this movie and why it sucks the way it does.Sincerely,A Matrix fan.",1
1421,This movie is well made ... it met my expectation taking into consideration keanu is getting old he nailed it...it's a matrix for today's world and if you are against upgrade that's why so much negative reviews...weird weird how they claim fans of the movie when served a different version they start complaining. I loved this movie well made and is entertaining...still can't digest these negative reviews am i in a different world or what.,10
1422,I regret watching this ruined my whole view of the original trilogy. Hot garbage. Everything was terrible even the action scenes had no redeeming qualities. I think this is the worst movie I saw in 2021.,1
1423,"Wow. If you have any respect for the first three films that I suggest staying away from this. This film force feeds you a woke agenda while slapping you across the face with unnecessary scenes scattered across the film. All in all, it felt like one big member-berry covered in rainbow stickers was being fed to me.",1
1424,"Nothing like the original, disturbed and warped beyond recognition. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the victim. Sad to see not worth my money or time,",1
1425,"First of all this movie doesn't contain lot of action and cool tricks like matrix 1 and 2. But it continues from the point where it left. More blue phills were inspired by the legendary act of neo and trinity, so they took the first step to getting out of the illusion. They freed the legends and fought beside them for a better future. Yeah, I agree this doesn't contain so much action sequels, but definitely worth watching it. There's so much to explore and so much to be understood. Matrix Fans, don't let your hopes down because of critic reviews and ratings of this movie. Please do watch it. Because you all worth it....",10
1426,"I couldn't watch in one sitting. I was bored stiff. I wanted to watch it because I was hoping it got better but it never did. Tedious and unnecessary, it doesn't even follow its own rules. I'm still unclear on a lot of the stuff in the movie but that's okay because this was awful anyway so I just don't care.Good cast for sure and solid direction, just a terrible script. Could have used a lot of editing too. Didn't need to come in a 2 and a half hours.Lots of fight scenes if you want to see that but nothing new.I hope they don't do another one but who knows. No one really asked for this one to begin with.",4
1427,"Here I am, to talk about a resounding flop, in all respects, and I'm not kidding.Matrix Resurrection is the fourth chapter in the Matrix franchise, it is pathetic and not epic, not like those of the original trilogy, which are fantastic and wonderful, while this film is very uglyBy the direction of only Lana from The Wachowski, thinking about it, it was as if the director knew that this film was useless, but she did not want to finish a story that is like a perfect cycle.It's very sad how the audience associates the name ""Wachowski"" only with Matrix, every time the sisters want to do a new film, it reveals as a flop because ""Wachowski"" is only Matrix.It is like a fanfiction, everything is explained, how but don't why, there isn't space for the interpretation or for the philosophical concepts. When you go to the cinema and you know you're going to watch Matrix, you expect, from this film, to deal with important themes with deep and complicated philosophical meanings, you certainly don't expect to watch a film that seems to be written on Wattpad.For instance, it is like a Disney film, yeah for kids, as if the director took the old trilogy, mixed it with a children's film and here we are, Matrix Resurrections. In addition, all the irony moments seems like for the children, but, obvious, the children don't watch this film because the Matrix Franchise (I mean only the old ones) isn't for kids.In support of this, some dialogues are put into the mouths of adults who would never use that kind of expression, that kind of slang, only for pleasing the public,This film's very didactic and simple, it shows everything to the viewer who already knows what he is going to watch. The film is mediocre, only for give the audience what it want and not for be original and surprise it, in substance, the film is a modern version that fits in with today's standards like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle, in summary, a fanservice.Changing argument, there isn't significance over the characters, there isn't interests over what they do, in particular the new ones.The characters have aged and when they move to fight, they are floppy and not as agile as they used to be, you look at them and think: what are they doing there?But in the end, it's not their fault, it's just life cycle.The characters from this film are like a parody of themselves, and talking about parodies, the parody of excellence, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's Morpheus.What is he doing there? Why did they do that?Because in the end there was no need for this character, just with his presence he ruins the existence of the original Morpheus, the god of dreams, I feel bad just thinking about it. But for heaven's sake the actor is good, but I just don't understand the need for a new Morpheus who moreover keeps saying he's a sort of copy of the original, who just tries to imitate him as best as possible, like I said, it's a parody.But we want to talk about Neo, alias of Thomas Anderson?Keanu Reeves is a fantastic actor and there is no need that I say that, but in this film, he is floppy and transmits depression, you just have to look at he to feel sad. In addiction his presence isn't justified, or better, they explain ""how"" but not ""why"" he is what he's.Somewhat like the presence of Trinity, interpreted, as always, by Carrie-Anne Moss.One of the biggest problems of this film is the fact that they use the concept of girl power too much, let me explain, they give Trinity play the role of the woman in love who defeats everything, there was no need for that, Trinity doesn't need "" the girl power"" because she's been like that since the beginning, even before they invented it. She's been a very strong woman who, let's say, didn't meet the standards of the time, she had, and still has, short hair with lots of gel, leather suits, motorbikes, and guns.It is a nonsensical concept for Trinity because her DNA has always been that of a warrior woman and not that of a damsel to be rescued who surprises everyone with a bit of luck.Let's talk about the enemies of Neo, the Agent Smith, in the original trilogy he had a very important role for the film, he was a character well done. There isn't a logical reason for his existence, he doesn't have sense and is practically useless, in fact, without him the story would have been the same, but this reflection, it wouldn't apply to the first three films, because as already mentioned, Agent Smith plays a really important role, particularly in the second and third film.The plot is practically copied, full of reshooting, for example; the white rabbit that reminds ""Alice in Wonderland"", the black cat, the red and blue pill, and EVEN the bullet time. All the things I've just enumerated, they take away all the mysteries and questions that were in the first films.As I said before, the plot is practically the same at the first film (the one from 1999), it's like when you give a classmate something to copy at school and he changes something to avoid making it too obvious, in short, the key word is ""parallelism"".The moments that should be funny interrupt the audience's immersion in the important moments and they detach it from the film, by consolidating the fourth wall and not trying to demolish it. In general, the audience wants to immerse themselves in the film, feel a multitude of emotions and have new experiences. In this, the audience knows they are watching it from a screen and not as part of it, they are not taken in. As if that were not enough, there're a lot of combatants that don't have an impact in the story, they don't have a sense and add nothing to the film, unlike those in the first three films, because there is always justified, and let me say it, all the choreography and pits are terrible.Moreover, this film is too much nostalgic over the others before, there are a lot of flashback and references really useless, precisely for remind you it is a reboot.Changing subject and going more technical, aesthetics, photography and cinematography, original are ruined. Before there was this strong green filter that made almost all the colors inside the Matrix, green or black, moreover, you could understand if the characters are inside the Matrix or not, thanks to the colors, in fact when they were in the real world the dominating colors were blue and grey, colors often associated with technology and the future, while inside the Matrix, precisely, this scale of green and black gave a feeling of unreality and unease.In the fourth film this important play of colors is lost, and the latter tend to be those of a blockbuster, moreover, it is no longer clear when the characters are actually inside the Matrix.Additionally, the bullet time. When the people think at Matrix, they think at Neo dodging bullets while is bent over in an unnatural position, the bullet time is nearly a trademark of Matrix, also this thing is lost in the fourth chapiter. The effects in general aren't very beautiful, with the modern conception of the world we have today, it is unthinkable that a film of 99 has more beautiful effects than one of 2021, that is, 21 years have passed, the situation should be improved, with this I say that if we compare the different films, the CGI in the former is much higher than that of this hideous film.Summarized, Matrix Resurrections doesn't have a reason to exist because it has a narrative power inexistent, it doesn't add anything and is useless. This movie is a horrible version of the original trilogy, a forgone movie, only with its presence, it ruins the first three movie.The only reason to watch it, is for making your opinion about it.Thanks for reading until this point :)",1
1428,Suck suck sucks!!This is movie was no worth a watch.It definitely doesn't live up to the image or brand of the Matrix reputation.Don't see the creativity of content and feels most of the time like an independent movie.,1
1429,I love Neo and Trinty they are cool but producers and writers for this last one must quit their jobs. Many stupid things happening in movie. It just ruined trilogy same like in Terminator. Im sad that 90s movies were much better and you feel atmosphere.,1
1430,"This movie did not pay homage to the original in any way, there was a lot of horrible acting, and a lot of cheesy shots that have college student could have done on their MacBook. It's not worth watching, it doesn't add to the story in anyway, the action is an exciting, cheesy ending where they kind of fall in love but kind didn't.",1
1431,"I am not interested in the 1philosophical depth"" of the script. If you think that you will find the meaning of life in a movie, you are already looking in the wrong place. All I care about is the quality of the action and effects. Yes, I am that shallow. Every action scene from the original Matrix still excites me. The action here is worse than B-movies. The effects are worse than they were 20 years ago. The art direction is so bad that you can even find better Netflix series. This movie has lowered the quality in every way.",4
1432,"So disappointing, the best thing about this movie was the trailer that offered some promise!A really weak script, it wad largely boring in parts and I wished I wad somewhere else. I'm a big fan of the franchise hence my open day cinema visit but let's be real, the 1st movie was ground breaking, the 2nd and 3rd were average but I liked them because they rode on the coat tail of the first.This film just gets complicated, lots of boring talking that offers nothing but also a massively excessive number of clips of matrix 1 - it strips any originality they hoped for in this 4th movie.I only pray they don't milk it any more with a series. As so often happens, a sad end to a great franchise.",4
1433,The first trilogy was so ahead of time .. Loved them !!! But the effect/fighting on this is like watching a b-movie and its matrix WTF !!!! What a money machine with no respect....,4
1434,This is awesome! Never expected there would be another matrix movie! I loved this movie and I would so love to see them make more! If you are a fan then you will enjoy this.,10
1435,This movie was just embarrassing. The budget for this movie could have made 4 more movies that are each 4 times as good as this one.Chad? Just... yikes.,1
1436,"I was so hopefull of this new addition to the Matrix series that I willed myself way longer than was strictly necesary to like this film. After the film had finished I struggled to piece together what was wrong exactly. Was it the plot? Was the actors? The special effects were in a way arguably better than the earlier trilogy, but then you would hope that with the advances of technology. What i've worked out is that whulst the plot follows on in a very logical way, its almost so logical that it fails to have the heart and essence of the trilogy. I think its great how they continued the young actors from the earlier tirlogy now adults playing main roles in this latest addition. I think that continuity stands up to the rigours of logic, but ehre just something about this absolute flop that was incredibly dissapointing. For me it all comes down to the story, and our investmenet in the characters. In the first Matrix I was emotionally invested in the characters more, their deaths were tragic and its triumph good vs evil was stoic and Tolkein esque. But in this you don't bond with the characters, and they barely seem to bond with each other, I couldn't care less if they all suddenly died because there seems to be little love between them. Instead they seem to be a tribe of followers of Neo who do anything for their newly rescued supreme being. Its a film that seems to even mock the audience, even the lighting seems comedic and lacks the gritty urban textures and moulding of tech world. It cuts out a lot of the peril from the origional too, now seemingly in the updated matrix logically speaking we can safely and easily move away from danger through handy little portals. Fair enough maybe, but it was like passing boringly from one boring fight scence to the next, one tedicous level to another in a never ending boring computer game that had no sign of ending, and when it did finally end with its almost fairytale sparkly ending it ends with a few poorly written lines. Well done for reversing gender roles further than trilogy could at the time I guess, but when the ending was this tragically banal who even cares? Laurence Fishburne was right to stay out of this one, but his replacement seems to be a comic rendering of morpheus that lacks sincerity and integrity. It lacks integrity and is more flat comedy, than edgy action packed heroic sci-fi tale that made serious groundbreaking phillosophical constructs of the trilogy. Don't bother, it will only break your heart.",4
1437,"I think it's pretty simple - if you loved the last film (Revolutions) then there's a chance you might like this. If like me you thought Revolutions was a directionless, bloated mess, then you're going to HATE this, 'cos it's more of the same, but with all the most boring bits turned up to 11.The first 20-30 minutes gave me hope that this was going somewhere different; I wish I'd turned it off then and remained ignorant.A good writer could've done some amazing things with this series. What an absolute shame.",4
1438,"Why? That's the question. The original film was never really followed by anything that did its initial triumph any justice. If you're not completely sick of a bunch of black leather, kung fu, and an amazing waste of bullets, then maybe you'll enjoy this. I am and I found it intensely boring. ""Hope and despair are almost identical as source code?"" Who cares? Just more rehash.The first sequel should have dealt with Neo's triumph over the matrix, but instead it just dragged on with more black outfits, machine guns, and kung Fu.NO MORE! PLEASE!!",5
1439,I have nothing good to say about this awful movie. The worst of all the remakes all they do is talk about how good the original was and show clips from the original 0/10 and now I kind of hate Keanu.,1
1440,"20 years was too long for a sequel using the same actors., especially for a Matrix movie which includes lots of martial arts and action. &gt;54 actors cannot do martial arts convincingly. Therefore, they had to dull it down, and it shows.This movie has twists that just don't fit the Matrix narrative. And it has holes, unlike the trilogy which had a tight story throughout. For example, Trinity was born in the Matrix. But apparently, unlike Thomas Anderson, she was not given her original name when she was inserted back into the Matrix. We never knew what her original name was, but apparently it was not Tiffany.How Trinity was able to immediately have superpowers upon awakening is way beyond Matrix guidelines. Even Neo couldn't immediately fly upon awakening -- neither the first time nor this time around. Yet Trinity was able to fly almost right out of the pod this time.And then the twist with Agent Smith was rather disappointing. Your archvillain becomes your most critical ally? Yeah, right! But, I get it. Managing the old characters with the new was quite an intricate undertaking.Having said that, it was well done and it held my attention throughout. The new technology is pretty cool. Bugs was right on. And although I never really liked Jada Pinkett's acting nor her Niobe character in the trilogy, she played older Niobe very well.",7
1441,I loved the original. I went to the cinema to see it in 1999 and it changed my life as well as introducing me to Rage Against the Machine. It went on to inspire games and movies for 2 decades and holds a special place in the hearts of most 30 somethings.This however changed its plot faster than the Wachoskis change their names and was like watching Vanilla Sky meets how I met your mother meets Cloud Atlas meets Ready Player One meets The Matrix 4. Just make this the last one please.,1
1442,We knew you not gonna beat the original trilogy. But we don't expect this trashy mumbo jumbo either.Go away and make another Jupiter film. Never talk about matrix again.,1
1443,Why all the hate. People are holding it to the same standard as the first Matrix which was fresh and original when it came out but you can't redo the exact same thing. I enjoyed the parody and how it cleverly evolves the story which confuses Neo and us viewers. There's a lot of nice nostalgic Easter eggs and callback moments. The story was great if somewhat rehashed but the real letdown are the fight scenes are not well shot like the first and second. There's a lot of fast cut scenes and shaky cam and no cool effects like 360 bullet time. Still I'm not gonna knock it too harshly as I'm a fan and am glad they even made a sequel and appreciate the talky first hour of world building. I like how they've added a civil war for machines and how machines and people work together to build a new city. This adds an element of realism. Overall don't listen to the critics as I immensely enjoyed it and the self parody comedy. It would be nice to have Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving back but the new actors played the part well enough. Highly recommended for real fans but keep an open mind and stop expecting the same as the original.,9
1444,"OK, ""Matrix Resurrections"" is not with many innovations and does not excel in any of the points where the first (and, until now, the other two in the original trilogy) stood out.But it has something new, a subtle humor and a self-irony (towards the whole franchise), and the film's discourse is a kind of a social critique (Wachowski always flirted with the idea of being intellectuals, they even reached some milestones of existentialism and, courageously, post-structuralism) put in a light, nice theme.Curious for me to see a slightly anti-Woke, boomer-like, plea, nostalgic for the pre-Zuckerberg and Tik-Tok era in a Lana Wachowski film. It was a nice surprise, but strengthened by the extraordinary Lambert Wilson (the Merovingian). The few minutes he speaks make the film extremely valuable.Keanu Reeves is not John Wicker, and Carrie-Ann Moss is really cool.And the Jefferson Airplane moment - ""White Rabbit"" (I'm conditioned here, it's my soul song for a long time) is very well done.All in all, for me it was unique to see a continuation of a series that is not dilluated, but can be watched with relaxation and without forcing yourselves to like it, just for the sake of the franchise. It's not a typical Matrix, it doesn't have as many symbols and it's not as spectacular as the others (I don't think it had the budget of its predecessors either), but it's a decent sequel.Rara avis these days.",10
1445,"This was so, so bad. Keanu looked like a homeless man with a speech impediment. All his powers were sticking out his hands and creating some sort of barriere. 100 mil bullets from the bad guys and none of them could hit even one of the good guys even from close range.Matrix.....just stop.....",1
1446,"It was really awful. Why did you ruin the name of the Matrix movie? Please do not create the next part of the Matrix. Sometimes you have to leave the past, you just destroyed our good memories, It was like a B-class movies. This movie bored me a lot, I really do not suggest you to watch it.",3
1447,"Clearly, the concepts and details in The Matrix Resurrections went WAY over the heads of most professional media reviewers, who need to see dumbed down material (appropriate for persons within the matrix) that is comic book / soap opera / video game. This is not a casual watch, but genuine theater material, since many details can go unnoticed. The movie provided a profound commentary on BOTH contemporary psychology and politics, unlike any sci-fi story that I can recall in a long time.",10
1448,This is almost like a fanfiction movie except the fan is a huge fan of romcoms.It has the feel of a Netflix movie and to me it isn't a matrix movie at all.There was no need for this.,2
1449,The new Matrix was absolutely awesome. Every second of this movie was on point. Mr Reeves did a spectacular job reprising his role as Neo. I highly recommend this movie.,10
1450,"I've always watched dumb movies this hit bottom. I immediately take a blue pill and forget that it exists, there are only three masterpiece films, at least now those who do not like the second and third will appreciate them for this nonsense. I hope Keanu was paid well.",1
1451,"Excluding the production values and the immortal charisma of Keanu Reeves, there is precious little to this movie that is redeemable.At best, it's an experimental deconstruction of a sci-fi classic that gets terribly out of hand. At worst, it's a terribly executed soft reboot with an uncertain tone and storyline that dabbles with humor and meta commentary at the most inappropriate times.This movie is produced with such disdain in some parts that it's difficult to rule out that this belated sequel was only made to satisfy a studio mandate.Any redeemable qualities to the story are frustrating because they could've been fascinating concepts if even the slightest effort was given to their development. Clearly, no effort was given.Two final suggestions for the Wachowskis on their next movie: try to be more subtle and show don't tell your story. These struggles have grown almost exponentially with every Matrix sequel that's been made.",2
1452,"I feel sick after seing this ! I got out of the movie theather after 1.5 hours. I cannot understand how they manage to flop like this and make a shame of the ""matrix"" name.I totally not recommend seing this ... ever.",1
1453,"Let me start by saying that I'm a true fan of the Matrix. I've seen all 3 on numerous occasions (more like 100 times each). So needless to say I was beyond hyped for this film. After watching the Matrix Resurrection I can only say I'm lost for words on how disappointed I am. The movie lacked direction, the passion is absent, the actors seemed just as confused as I was and I honestly feel like this should have never happened to such a great franchise. Besides all that, you have to be blind not to notice their message in this film is completely catering to the gay crowd. What an awful film I'm just done. If there's another one I won't be watching.",1
1454,"I'm a 90s kids... I didn't get on the matrix until my early 20s so I'm late to the game.But I'll tell you this, if I wanted to sit through a 2.5 hour lecture I'd just speak to my father about my life choices.My recommendation on this is actual have some movie... it was just talking constant force feeding us every scene, more of an audio book than a movie.",4
1455,"It is a very difficult task to try and rest on ones laurels and expect similar results. The Matrix trilogy is a cult classic. What always happens when those classics get a reboot, remake or resurrection, is that the fans and audiences in general become disappointed.The Matrix storyline definitely has more to it. There are so many things that could have been done. Yet, Resurrections fails to offer any of that. What it lacks in originality it tries to make up for in fan service.That has created a film where the audience is essentially being told the story of the original trilogy. Resurrections, or any reboot film, should never have to do that. If we wanted to watch the original trilogy we would go and watch it. We don't need clips from that trilogy every 5 minutes to remind us that we are indeed watching a Matrix film... Most people have seen these movies by now or binged them on a streaming service before going to the theatre.If you are a fan of the original trilogy or even simply watched them all at some point in time, this new installment offers nothing new. The plot itself is extremely weak because it hinges so heavily on the original trilogy. So much potential completely lost. There is a hint that there will be more to come, I certainly hope not. This is one sleeping giant that should have been left to rest.",1
1456,"Before anything i know for sure that Matrix Resurrections will be a love or hate opinion, and I fully understand both sides. For me it's just a fantastic ride against conformist, control, and prejudgement. Even WB studio is criticized. Making fun of the Matrix itself we are close to a satire, totally different from the first 3 movies. Neo/ Trinity are just unbelievable, perfect chimestry that will lead us to the final act. Yes I really enjoyed a movie that doesn't want to be mainstream. I didn't like some acting, probably some action sequence aren't that good but the story, the Matrix universe is just amazing!",9
1457,"Im very surprised. All the cliches used in a sickening ""humorous"" way and really surprised. This was made either 100% for the money or idk.. But how did the actors even agree to the script (of course, they dont understand 1/2 of the movie cause nothing happens real time)..If You cant get it for free, its not worth it (i stopped with 50min left, just so boring and looks like hallmark ""reserve"" movie cast has made it together). Just will leave a stain of once a interesting idea, once a interesting concept and cinematography.. Good luck, maybe the fifth comes out better. And I hope Keanu reads his scripts more carefully before agreeing ! Happy 2022, all has failed in 2021, even matrix :D.",2
1458,I am so sad because they destroyed a good trilogy..I lost 2 hours from my life.They just invented a new story to make more money.A big garbage!!! Nothing more!,1
1459,"WARNING: Detailed review ahead - skip to the end for a TLDR version.""It's as if everything we did was for nothing."" - Neo, The Matrix ResurrectionsThere is a well-known philosophical concept that people have been discussing probably ever since atoms first began to be taught as the building blocks of physical reality. The question is something like this: If someone you were very close to, someone you loved and knew intimately (or even yourself) were to die and you could bring them back, rebuild them exactly as they were, each and every nerve, atom by atom - would it be the same person? If yes, why? If not, who are they? Before atoms, people used to make horror films about how resurrecting the dead, even a loved one, even animals, will make them come back all wrong.The Matrix Resurrections takes this concept quite literally, and answers it quite clearly - no one is who they used to be, all they have are memories and flashbacks, deja-vus and words that have been said before. The film is a perversion of The Matrix, a zombie more than a Second Coming.I won't be spoiling anything by recalling the events of previous films, such as Neo's Messianic sacrifice at the end of Matrix 3. So how is it that he's back in the Matrix, in the present day, and aged by twenty years? I won't spoil that for you, if you plan on seeing this film, but it wouldn't change anything anyway. All that matters is that Neo is back because the plot requires him to be back, but he's not quite Neo, and he's not quite back.His name is Tom (also known as Thomas Anderson), and he's a world-famous video game developer now, known for the Matrix Trilogy, a VR game series that Tom struggles to believe didn't actually happen to him in real life. He lives alone in a stylish, futuristic apartment, and regularly visits a cafe called Simulatte. In this version of the Matrix, everyone knows him, and if they don't know him, they definitely know his games. Think Bethesda's Todd Howard, the man behind Skyrim, Oblivion and Fallout series. But bigger.But even with his memories wiped, Tom is haunted by the same feeling that he had since the first film. That something isn't right with the world, with his life. Unlike before, now his feelings are being kept in check by a therapist, whom he calls ""the analyst"", who keeps trying to bring Tom ""back to reality"" and ensure that the Matrix and Neo remain as fictional ideas in Tom's head - reality and illusion are switched in Tom's head. The Matrix is a fictional video game, nothing more...The premise sounds promising. We learn as much in the trailer.Meanwhile, a cast of new ""unplugged"" characters come in to form a group whose first priority is to free Neo, to remind him of who he is, and what is/was real. It results in a kind of tug-of-war between these ""liberators"" and The Analyst, who employs all kinds of manipulative tactics to ensure Neo remains ""plugged in"", even prescribing him blue pills, and trying to convince Tom/Neo that he's a mentally unstable person (Tom/Neo: ""Am I crazy?"" The Analyst: ""We don't use that word around here"").But Neo is not the only one plugged into the Matrix. Trinity is out there too, now going by the name of Tiffany. Tiffany is married to a guy named Chad, and has two or three kids. Coincidentally, she regularly visits the same cafe as Tom/Neo, Simulatte. Eventually, the two start talking, and sparks fly. Tiffany confesses she's unhappy with her life, feeling like she's been ""programmed by society"" to want things that didn't really fulfill her, and that the character Trinity in Tom's video game bears striking similarity to her. Being with Tiffany ends up being the most important reason behind Neo's awakening, and also his every motivation thereafter.Everything else in the film made no sense whatsoever, or was too stupid, too contrived or completely irrelevant. This new character, Bugs, was at first intriguing because she seemed to have a special connection to Neo, Trinity and Morpheus - almost as if she was Neo and Trinity's child, having qualities of both, and at times deliberately talking and behaving like Trinity. But nothing much about her gets explained, and the actress tends to talk quickly in a strange English accent so many times I couldn't make out what she was saying, and it usually happened whenever she was explaining something contrived or providing some kind of backstory. And don't get me started on the Morpheus replacement, I have no idea what that even is because it was muttered once and never again, but my guess is that he's meant to be a re-upload of Morpheus' memories or consciousness, only he is nothing like Morpheus, and is a sentient AI. The Morpheus we know was chiefly defined first by his unshakable belief in Neo as the (reincarnation) of the Savior and second by his incredible leadership abilities. He exuded a classic wise mentor role that we would associate with the likes of Yoda or Gandalf (but one who also knows gun fu). In this film, he was a comic relief with a flamboyant dressing style and a glass of Martini. I mean, what?And remember the classic cold green-blue tint from the previous films? That subtle colouring which indicated when one was inside The Matrix? Now The System looks ""beautiful"", and the Matrix is more associated with shiny gold, with many scenes featuring plenty of bright sunshine. Instead of feeling horrified, characters are content when they are able to perceive the Matrix code - their prison - around them...There are so many questions, plotholes and abandoned concepts as well, but many of which are haphazardly explained to Neo in dialogue (like why some machines are actually helping humans now, what happened to Morpheus, what happened to Zion, why the Matrix still exists etc etc).The most disappointing aspect, however, was not the plot, or the characters, or the special effects... It was the fight scenes. It's been chaos throughout. The only highlight was a bunch of possessed people leaping out of skyscraper windows like a bunch of kamikaze planes yeeting themselves at Neo and Trinity, but that was verging on comedy.The Matrix films are known for pushing boundaries, but the only thing that was pushed here was my patience. Halfway through the film I was contemplating on walking out from boredom, and that's relatively rare for me when it comes to films - especially being a fan of the Matrix Trilogy (and Animatrix, and Making Of/Behind the Scenes etc).But there WAS one genuine aspect where Lana Wachowski did push limits.Bold self-awareness for what this film really is.The Matrix Resurrections is distinguished from other nostalgia remakes/reboots/sequels plaguing our screens in recent years by directly addressing that. My jaw actually dropped when Smith, after inviting Tom to his office, ordered him to start working on the ""fourth Matrix game"" because of a major contract with Warner Brothers, and if the game isn't made in time, there will be serious economic consequences. There were several scenes which had a peculiar quality as if portraying real-life experiences of Wachowski. There are scenes and dialogues of a team of young video game developers talking about what The Matrix is supposed to represent/be a metaphor of, what it should be etc, a conversation about how sequels should be the same as prequels, with minor differences, how the wheel shouldn't be re-invented etc. Meanwhile Tom, who is the mastermind of The Matrix series, sits quietly, in a complete daze, giving no input whatsoever to this Fourth Matrix game... It indicates that this may be what happened in real life. This isn't Lana Wachowski's film, it's made by a group of people who have no capacity for deep philosophical or existentialist thought or any understanding or connection to the first film.Tldr; This film explains nothing and changes nothing. Instead I suggest you watch The Animatrix if you haven't already - a beautifully crafted series which explains everything about The Matrix lore and provides a lot of food for thought. The Matrix Resurrections isn't a Wachowski film - it's a conspiracy by Warner Brothers.",4
1460,"How could a film this atrocious be allowed into the Matrix repertoire? Why even make another if the story and acting were going to be this disappointing? It's a slap in the face to all of us who were forever changed by the first Matrix film.Whoever was in charge of casting should be ousted from Hollywood for eternity. Not sure it could get much worse than this. Matrix: Revolutions is an award winning film compared to Resurrections. Morpheus, the Analyst and the pathetic performance of Smith were downright embarassing for a Hollywood picture. I now have to pretend this film was never created. Whatever you do Lana Wachowski, do not make another film. Please.",2
1461,"The first Matrix film, when it came out was a revelation. The subsequent three movies have all been a let down. It seems the Wachowski Brothers/sisters are incapable of making a movie to get remotely close to the first one.",5
1462,"I don't want to spend more time for this one, already lost 2,5 hour from my life watching it, so I will cut short just for the sake of the old masterpiece.Concept purpose of the film is brand new with no development in the idea poorly made ,design and written.Acting was very bad, I will keep it simple this one.Script dialog I am sure we will see many memes coming out it, it was like I was watching a parody.Sound design not something to be happy with it.Character development goes minus -0, is like they didn't even study the matrix.Script in overall was really bad.Technical cinematography was a disaster.Cliches everywhere.Color correction and color direction takes 0.New probes concept and design, such a Morpheus or the friendly robots was way out of line, from design aspect but also from character development.All I have to say is that I hate the producers for destroying the masterpiece called MATRIX. Overall it was cheap-made like movie, with the feeling of something coming out of bollywood. This disaster might be worst than Game of Thrones ending....",1
1463,"Bland music, glacial pacing, distractingly bad lighting and framing in most scenes, trite dialogue delivered without passion, distracting callbacks, an embarrassingly out of touch take on 'gamers', and a plot with nothing much to say. Special effects are a step backward, especially the jarring, incredibly low budget 'bullet time' and time rewind effects. Worst of all the combat, whether with guns or fists, is slow, lacking impact, and shot with enough cut-aways that it looks like it comes from a bad film from 20 years ago. The Wachowskis made one good movie followed by two mostly (but not wholly) wretched mistakes in the original Matrix trilogy. Resurrections takes all the bad parts of the previous movies and cuts anything that made them special. Even Keanu, modern, charming Keanu, can't carry this. Hopefully this movie is a financial failure so no-one funds a follow-up.",2
1464,"Just horrible, plain horrible. Not worth seeing. Should have left it alone with the original and groundbreaker, as Matrix sequels were just as bad. Keanu returning along with Carrie Ann Moss were the only highlights. Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving were missed but probably knew this film would've been a dud and spared being part of this awful movie.",1
1465,"I don't know why the old times, the special effects looked like something well done, and well created, nowadays, specially in this movie, the budget most have been so low that they didn't give a damn about that part of the movie. The the part of they showing shots of the old movies, looked like some publicity like ""do you remember this old movie, do you remember it?"" like come on, that was so unecessary...And all this thing of grabbing the old actors who are old as f, to make this actions scenes, omg, can I puke now?",1
1466,I guess I was waiting for something to grab me so I gave this movie 90 minutes. But then I was done. Convoluted and boring at the same time. The early segments with NPH doing therapy with Keanu were slightly interesting but the rest was a blah rehash of the old themes. And the glaring absence of Laurence Fishburn was most annoying. I'm glad I was at home watching on HBOMax. I saved some money at least.,3
1467,"I would love to give it a 6 but the photography feels generic, the makeup is subpar and the costume design is bad. On top of all that the film wastes way too much time explaining and praising it self on the mirror, the fight sequences have no magic and feel pointless, and the main premise and villains are far too weak to hold any water. There are some pretty cool concepts in it but all badly explored or used and aren't enough to make you ignore all the cringe worthy scenes in it.It's cool to see Neo and Trinity once again on the screens, but I guess this should just have been left alone. 5.5 for the effort.",5
1468,"Everyone did their job well except the script writers.The movie is missing a soul.Was it supposed to be a super hero movie?All these references to today to make the audience feel connected, cringe.And the ending... dear Gods! Did they imply they might pull another one?",5

1470,"This is a failed attempt to reboot the Matrix. The storyline is nonsensical and generates a lot of head-scratching. The stylishness and quirkiness of the original Matrix is replaced by tackiness and awkwardness, so strong that this should just be viewed as a B film. Both Neo and Trinity should have just stayed dead.",5
1471,"This film start with a woman ""Bugs"" talking with her teammate, and bunch of gunmen went into a room scene! As turnout, this film is about Bugs need to bring back Trinity, and Neo to the Matrix world, in order to resurrect them! Entire film full of quite intense action scene! Such as, bloody shooting, martial art fighting, explosion, car chase, car crash, things broken, flying, shielding bullet, and fighting with superpower! Make the film quite watchable! At the end, Neo fly away with Trinity after both of them been resurrected! Still have a post credit scene! A bunch of programmers talking about making a series of video called ""The Catrix""! That's it! A recommended film!",7

But hollywood wants you to believe it's a social victory if all the check boxes are checked in a fantasy movie.",4
1473,"What a mistake, a lunge for your pockets. The script is confused, inconsistent, and dull. Dialogue is often muddy, and almost always silly and clichéd. The direction is lacklustre, and most of the acting is phoned in. Production values are good, but not excellent.As time goes by, my memory of it gets worse.Maybe watch this on the small screen, or better, just skip it.",2
1474,"Sad. The greatest strength of the trilogy was to make you think and ask yourself what if I'm just a simulation? Here, a lot of absurdities, a multitude of leading viewers by the hand, a cheap script and quite numb acting acting of new characters. Matrix resuscitation.",4
1475,"It does everything that's expected when bringing back a franchise. There's hate, but those of us that really loved it back when ratings didn't mean ratings on every web page this is it.

1476,"Seems most of what comes out of Hollywood is just flexing how woke they are, this too... kind of punny. It really had an opportunity to break the mold again, wish they ran somewhere different with the story at the beginning but nope... The Matrix: Regurgitations.",5
1477,"Matrix lV heavily relies on nostalgia from the first Matrix. Except this sequel almost makes a spoof or parody of the original at the beginning. Then all is revealed.Just because there's lots of callbacks to the original doesn't make this sequel on par. In fact, it just shows what a masterpiece the first one was. It's effects, including the iconic ""bullet time"" was unrivaled, and is still amazing today. 'Resurrections' uses CGI to complete a lot of their action sequences, but it's nothing groundbreaking like it was before.Reeves and Moss fall into their characters of old without missing a beat. Newcomers to the franchise, Neil Patrick Harris and Jessica Henwick were also good. New Morpheus edition was interesting. Smith replacement... that's a tall order and unfortunately the character is just not the same without Weaving.I'm not exactly sure where this one lies among the other two sequels. 'Reloaded' is probably better, but the three sequels are all about the same for me. They all have their own pros and cons.",7
1478,"Dear Hollywood producers and once successful filmmakers that can't get past their only good film,Please stop releasing absolute nonsense, cash grab sequels that make no point.Who on earth asked for this boring, self referential piece of garbage?Just accept that the fruits of a almost 20 year old trilogy might not be as ripe as you think when you drink alone at night in your penthouse.Another thing I want to address, you need to understand that recasting half your movie has never worked out...not onceThis film bears the mark of a time in which originality became unimportant to bring cash in the bank. Why not make a film inspired by the Matrix by actually good writers? Why is there a need, especially right now, to butcher every single franchise that had remotely any success in the last 30 years?This needs to end! Better yesterday than tomorrow. If I see one more ""Movie X part 4,5,6,7 the pre sequel to the sequels"" or pretty millionaires fooling around in front of a green screen for over 2 and a half hours playing the same freaking characters over and over and over and over again, I will completely stop to watch anything anymore in theaters with big production value!PS: Independent Cinema always had more bite, go and buy some DVDs/Blu Rays of good underground stuff that actually tries to create an entertaining and unique experience through writing, acting and directing rather than through ""I got that reference haha, isn't that from the 20 year old original?""",1
1479,"I love the Matrix, but they should have left it dead if this is the best they could come up with. Took me 3 attempts to make it thru the end, I kept having to turn it off when I had enough for one sitting. Two stars is a big stretch, I was feeling generous since it is Xmas day. Pitiful writing, directing AND acting. Permanent damage was done to the Matrix franchise by this flop!",2
1480,"Quite frankly, I don't see how this got bad reviews. I'm actually quite shocked. In my opinion, the bad reviews come from people who never understood the first 3. I was entertained and engaged the entire time.",10
1481,First of all I wasnt to impressed by the names title of the film. The film was a bit weird at first neo working for a games company on the title matrix. Then as the film went on it all got explained then I got the jeest of it. Neo in this matrix didn't really do as much fighting as previous. Matrix film's so was a bit disappointed with this matrix is the weakest out of the 4 matrix film so far but over all it was ok I just hope john wick chapter 4 is better.,4
1482,"This is the third sequel to the classic film ""The Matrix"", so, really, it's best to start at the start with this franchise, although the next two sequels were major disappointments. That first film made an impact with its special effects and playing with the notions of Scepticism, as in the idea that we can't be sure that what we perceive to be reality really is real. It married such philosophical ideas with exciting action sequences to great effect. The first sequel gave me the sense that it was treading water but that the trilogy could still end strongly. Unfortunately, the last film in the trilogy sank for me, which would retrospectively have made the first sequel sinking, rather than treading water. It's a good thing that there was enough distance between me seeing the previous sequels at the cinema and this new entry, as I still had fond memories for the first one.Since the last time I saw the previous sequels was at the cinema on release, I have to say that I had already forgotten what transpired in them, having just a vague recollection of some blonde-haired male twins in them, causing havoc for our hero, I think. Apparently Neo (played by Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) died in the last one. Apparently they were also romantically involved too, which I don't remember either. So, that makes the concept of a sequel in which these two characters feature rather problematic. Fortunately, the title of this new entry spells out how things will proceed.It has to be said that the latest in this franchise is very ""meta"". By that I mean it depicts scenes which could be about the very making of this film itself. You are introduced to the idea that the original trilogy isn't what you thought it was, which would be...in keeping with the nature of the series, where the world of this story is...not what you thought that it was. How much you enjoy this new entry might depend on how much you like your films to be ""meta"". Personally, I was okay with this and in fact could have gone along with the direction the film seemed to be going early on. By that I mean I would have enjoyed a film which really has no connection to the world of the original Matrix trilogy and where there was no physical action at all to speak of. Having said that, I should point out that if they made anything which was unlike the first two sequels, I would have liked it more than those first two sequels. As it stands, I liked this film as it was. It doesn't go the full Monty, as far as ""meta"" goes. I remember reading Miles Franklin's ""My career goes bung"", which was written at the start of the previous century and being disappointed that it went ""meta"", which was not what I was hoping for in her (belatedly published) 'sequel' to ""My brilliant career"" (which was turned into a great film). Since I have heard mixed things about this new Matrix film, maybe the Franklin reference is apt (for some)?The ""meta"" aspect to this film makes me wonder how much truth there was in those scenes and whether it could have gone harder on this angle. Were the writers and star self-loathing at the prospect and 'necessity' of doing this all over again? Perhaps Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) could have been represented as succumbing to the temptation of a lot of money to keep the franchise going? Maybe dialogue was written which was cut for being too close to the bone as far as how Hollywood works? If so, I think that THAT could have worked really well in this film. It's not clear whether the film is having fun with the 'necessity' for its existence or feeling dirty about its creation.Anyway, this new film does have a clear focus on the relationship between Neo and Trinity. Keanu Reeves has a stilted way of delivering his lines for most of the film, as if he's been concussed and is a little 'slow' as a result. In the scene where things are just about to go pear-shaped in the toilet with Neo and a black man, Keanu's approach works nicely for that moment. Speaking of that black man, I didn't mind how the film handled old characters returning in a novel way. That could have been included in the ""meta"" aspect of this film, I think.Back to Trinity, I had a genuine moment of emotion in this film, as in a sort of subdued joy, perhaps you could call it, when Neo is waiting for her with his 'therapist' at a restaurant, I think and...she enters. At this moment, what is to follow is not certain but I felt my emotion swelling at the possibility that something good was about to happen. These kinds of moments are so rare in the films that I've been watching lately that I have to give kudos to films which elicit this response. Marvel films would like to trade in that kind of emotion but they've never drawn that out of me, as far as I can remember. They just don't have those kind of film-making chops.As for the how the film ends, well, it works as a final chapter in the series but it could also function as the start of another Marvel-like explosive diarrhoea of new content. A trilogy of trilogies, perhaps? Do the Wachowskis yearn to complete this second trilogy and then for Disney to buy the rights to the franchise and make a final trilogy? Maybe Keanu Reeves could develop a personal friendship with Mark Hamill and turn to him for consolation? I dunno.Random notes:* This film was tracking for a score of 80%. Dipped to 75+% on the thought that was maybe too generous (but the plus sign means I'd still give it 8 out 10 stars whereas I wouldn't without it). That moment with Trinity put it back up to 80% but the Marvel-like ending brought it down to 77.5+%. The Marvel-like post closing-credits sequence made me drop the plus sign...it's a cliché aspect to the film which undoes the film's good work in it's use of the other cliché ""meta"" element. Is it meant as a throwaway joke or is it part of the story? Why bring this ""meta"" into play again?* The desires of audiences are discussed in the film. The sense is that rubbish is produced because they want it. That seems to imply that the producers of culture are blameless and that it's the audience's fault for all the rubbish being made. I'd suggest that the producers are more than capable of being derivative, lazy and woeful even when they're aiming high.* When the 'Sandman' is at 'Rapunzel's tower', is that a narrative mistake of the film (which can be 'fixed' in a sequel) or was it intended?* Who was Tiffany's reflection on the table when she was having a coffee with Thomas?* Is the therapist's black cat a red herring?* A machine in this film reminds me of Songbird in the BioShock Infinite video game.",8
1483,"Doesn't worth to spent money on this movie .It is just bad ,really bad .. I don't even know why they didnt change the movie name ...it is not matrix or anything is more about a romance/adventure/comedy .",1
1484,"This is great, it's made well, and it continues the plot well, if I say anything it gets spoilery, but I mean, I haven't ever watched anything that breaks the fourth wall this well, so thanks to everyone who made this, oh I didn't like the ending a lot...; last 5ish minuits of it :p, but that's ok...",10
1485,"Overall, the movie is pretty good. It starts slow however, but then it picks up and shows off some really good action. So the pacing does suffer in the first half.Chemistry between Neo/Trinity/Morpheus is certainly there and the movie has a ton of throwbacks to previous parts. It cohesively fits into the franchise and production quality is top notch. However, the ending was quite a disappointment. The movie lacked a strong villain and that shows toward the end.You definitely should watch it if you love previous movies.",7
1486,I'll still never understand why Lawrence Fishburne never received a phone call to be Morpheus in this..I've seen all the matrix movies but have NO DESIRE to watch this one...The opening rating was at 6.6 and by the next morning it was down to 6.1...if that doesn't tell you all you need to know idk what does?,5
1487,"I felt like watching Cobra Kai with all them references to the previous matrix.Cobra Kai did the same thing by giving us scenes from the previous movies.So, it was repititive and boring.Also... That thing that Reeves acted more like a human shield in the last hour insteed of playin the character Neo, was frustrating.",5
1488,You know how all the Austin Powers movies just rehash the jokes from the previous movie? And they get worse every time? This movie is like that except the joke is the fact that we got excited for it in the first place.,5
1489,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen! An insult to the first Matrix and all those who were hooked by it 20 years ago. The 2nd and 3rd parts were not great either, but they look like masterpieces compared to this shlock. It's truly amazing how much Hollywood has gone downhill in 20 years. So sad...",1
1490,"This movie is BY FAR the worst in the series, and I have no idea how some people seem to think it's just ok. The best parts of the movie where when clips from the other films were used. This was such a lazy technique. I couldn't get myself to care about these characters. The villains were lame or underdeveloped. The pacing was terrible. The script was garbage. Even I could've made a better movie than this. 1 star.",1
1491,So very disappointed that this was the best they could come up with after all these years. A shame. Each one has been worse than the previous version. This chapter added nothing new.,3
1492,"Why would someone decide to ruin one the most iconic movies of all time? If the answer is money, it doesn't make sense since it didn't even do well even in sales.The biggest take after watching was that Hollywood is clearly dead. Successful directors in the past, are incapable of producing decent content and new directors are more after hopping on the train of gender equality, racism and ... without really connecting to their audience.Perhaps thats why a mediocre Nolan is being considered a great director of new generation.",5
1493,"Such underwhelming performances and style compared with any of the prior movies. Waited for it to get better, interesting, something...then it just got stupid.",3
1494,"I am a matrix fan. I'm not exaggerating when I say that these movies were the tomato soup when I didn't feel happy. I watched them repeatedly on good days and difficult days. They transported me to another place, and even with the terrible acting from Keeanu Reeves, the creative aspects and the other actors made up for it. Saying that, it's with great disgust that I report that Ressurections is HORRIBLE. It has none of the original creativity, the music is awful, the action is cliche, and the plot is dumb. I was only halfway through when I admitted that the creators had ruined something classic. I vowed to never watch Ressurections again, and I'll do my best to pretend that it never happened so I can enjoy the originals. Don't bother watching it. It will only ruin your day.",1
1495,Sometimes it's better to stop rather than relying on an unprofessional people who think their ideas are best-selling and somethings needs time in order to perfect it.,3
1496,"Complete disaster! Nothing like the other films. They should have never made this chapter.The whole movie is memories from previous chapters, and everything else is incredible nonsense. Nothing to do with the thrill of the first movies and it had to end with them. Always after such iconic films in 10-15 years they decide to make a sequel, which is literally sucked out of the fingers and is a huge disappointment.",1
1497,"I was quite surprised to find out that there will be another Matrix and was awaiting the movie with very high expectations... Alas, what a disappointment!I won't comment in details, it is pointless. What I can tell you - this move is targeting the GenZ/GenAlpha. It is in YouTube format, where you see some low IQ influencer commenting the previous movies, explaining to the audience what happened before (but in a very bad way, with limited vocabulary, a true Globalization child). I almost thought we are in the wrong theatre, and we are watching a documentary on the Matrix series, but no, that was the movie itself! No comment...Most of my friends didn't even finish watching it and left early. My wife fell asleep - it was THAT BAD. I managed to stay awaken till the end, I was hoping to see something new or something of value, but unfortunately the movie was bad from the beginning till the end.",2
1498,"I counted on 3 separate occasions on the number of times the scene cut in 60 seconds:40 cuts per min3236. The woman in the coffee shop said 3 separate lines when leaving and keeanu didnt say a word. Keeanu constantly gives 1 word answers, and they literally called out that they were making an unnecessary movie. Just straight set the script for the first one on the table. Some of the scenes were SO WEIRD, and some of the characters were so unlikable in the company. There was a rubber ducky on keeanu's head in a bath tub which was weird. The compilation in the beginning was horrible.The story did get better as it went along but was still ridiculous.",3
1499,"This is just a reheated soup, but eaten at second hand, if you know what i mean. It tastes so bad that you think , not that you are eating an old rag , but also a very used one. Keanu Reaves looks and acts like an old little man who lives by his memories. Surprisingly Trinity still lokks good, but having a very bad script doesn't do any good to the show. The other are just figurants in a movie set. The screenplay is bad, the ideas old and regurgitated and then spit. There's nothing here to be seen. Go do someting else.",1
1500,"Hard to know where to start with this one, everything is so bad..The story (if there is one) feels like a first draft by a film student or some offbeat fan fiction. It's awkward, disjointed and confusing.The script is equal parts nonsense and cheese.The casting is mostly terrible, particularly the casting of Smith! Looks like they accidentally gave the casting director the brief from Bad Neighbours. Everything about him screams dbag frat boy not Agent Smith.Lana Wachowski's direction is so far away from the quality of the first matrix. Half the movie contains clips from the first film, which are presumably there to help people draw a parallel and evoke nostalgia but really just highlight how bad this movie looks compared to the first. Not to mention the pacing is off and there's no sense of drama or suspense. I genuinely didn't care what happened to any of the characters by the end, I just wanted the movie to finish.The costumes are horrifying, the main group look like they are dressed for a Kpop music video and Smith's outfit looks like it's picked at random on Asos.The colour grading looks like it's done by someone on loan from the Disney channel, I half expected them to burst into a musical number.The effects are a mix of decent and something you might see in a b movie on the syfy channel.Amazingly it might even make you miss the 2nd and 3rd movies, and that's very worrying. Don't waste your money.",1
1501,"Not much else to add to the other reviews really. It's a long film, with a boring plot and flat characters. They should have just stopped after the trilogy. I don't think I'd even bother to see anymore if they do any. Don't waste your ti e watching.",2
1502,"I can't imagine a more ambitious undertaking than picking up a legendary film franchise 18 years later and having it succeed. Even George Lucas tried with the Star Wars prequels and they were failures on so many levels. This film manages to capture the essence, the tone, and maintains visual symmetry with its origins. It is very good. The story is complex but relates perfectly to the trilogy. It is engaging and Interesting. This is Lana Wachowski at her best, unlike Jupiter Ascending. The cast of originals and newcomers are perfect. Keanu Teeves is Neo and we can't get enough of him. The action is great. The one area that has slipped, perhaps due to Reeves' and Moss's age, is the fight choreography is not exactly at the trilogy level. I need to see this again for sure. Neil Patrick Harris is actually shockingly good in this one. I love The Matrix films.",8
1503,"Really thats all you have to know guys, 3 kids and one metal fraction guy sit on dolphins and went to save Trinity.Lana, 20 years i was waiting for the actual ending of greatest scenario, and we got this, a third-rate comedy, where each dialogue makes me cringe.I was watching the first movie on VHS so many times untill the film is eraised.And now i remember the moment when Neo comes into place with his ice cold mimics, opens coat and amazing music starts to pump your adrenaline, he is running with Trinity on walls, all this scenes making you feel goosebumps.The amazing love story between two charesmatic characters, how they struggle to save each other, in all 3 episodes, that was amazing. And now we get Transformers with a slice of Fast and Furios and cheap jokes, where movie makes me feel its all just a joke and i have just wait till the moment when the actual Matrix starts.. Nope not this time guys.Lana, I ask to withdraw this movie from the film distribution, please!",1
1504,"The Matrix Resurrections is indeed as enjoyable as the last mouthful of chicken parmesan you decide to have for no particular good reason. With a slight instant gratification that lasts as long as the time it takes for you to scramble around your wife's purse for an antacid.A tedious meta corporate flimflam. A lackluster performance by Jonathan Groff and an entertaining set of monologues by Neil Patrick Harris accompany varying disappointing plot and character solutions for loyal lovers of the franchise. Is Keanu Reeves still a magnificent actor in his role as Neo? Yes. Did I sit through the entire film hoping to be less infuriated by the superfluous incessant unoriginality and liquid paper stricken plot? Yes, again.The film drowns itself and its audience with the redundancy of its past glory. A choice was certainly an illusion for the gluttonous team who green-lit this installment of the franchise.",5
1505,"Alas, I almost wish I didn't see this installment. I loved the Matrix trilogy, even though with each installment the story line lost a bit of the original's greatness. This was so slow moving and so was Keanu (who I really like as an actor). Absolutely none of the passion in his character of Matrix 1. I was asking myself if he was way too old to do this one. Even with Trinity coming back, there was no chemistry that I could see or feel between them, not like before. The Analyst played by P. N. Harris, was so miscast, imo, with way too much over-acting. I wasn't convinced at all. And, wait, at the end are they telling us that Trinity is ""the One"" because she saves Neo? And what's with the mark on the bridge of Priyanka's nose? I read she got a not so good nose job(s), but c'mon, that mark was distracting. Nothing else to say except this was a 2nd rate version of a sequel to a much-beloved franchise and a terrible way to end it. And I stayed through to the end, fyi.",3
1506,"That's the word that came to mind after watching the film. It was okay. For me, I did not see the point in having another film when the trilogy brought closure. It's worth the watch, but definitely last in ranking out of the 4 films.",8
1507,The Matrix Resurrections sadly personifies the woke culture with cringe leftist ideology. Seems like a money grab and destroyed the legacy of the brand.,1
1508,"This is easily the worst Matrix film out of all 4. I was skeptical about a sequel being made to begin with, but, I had hope that this one would turn out alright.I was painfully wrong. Damn near half of the film is CONTINUOUS frame by frame flashbacks to the original film. I'm not even kidding either, literal whole scenes are ripped from the first movie and placed into this one to add to the ""Nostalgia"" factor that this movie fails to do right. None of the new characters are interesting at all. There are barely any action scenes and the ones that are in the movie are piss poor and not very entertaining nor impressive. The story itself could've probably been written by a high schooler if they were given enough time.Really the only good things about this film are various concepts or ideas that the movie BRIEFLY touches on. And that's it, that's literally it.Don't bother watching this movie. It's not good and really just a waste of everyone's time who waited over 15+ years for a pile of garbage.",4
1509,"For the little the movie did get right there is so much wrong. Where do I even start?For starters, it was a surreal experience to watch a movie that hated the fact that it existed to begin with. From the beginning there were some not-so-subtle jabs at current Hollywood movie trends. Lana made it clear that she did not want to make this movie, and you can tell based off of the finished product just how little she actually cared for the story or the characters in this film.There were good spots. I loved the chemistry between Neo and Trinity. Keanu and Carrie and have really done a great job of carrying the chemistry that made the original trilogy work. Bugs &amp; Seq were standouts as well. I also thought the remixed Agent Smith did a great job as well. There were a few monologues that were really good too.Everything else just didn't work. From Keanu essentially cosplaying as a version of himself while playing Neo, a cringeworthy Morpheus performance, to the blatant fourth wall breaking that really didn't serve the story in any real capacity, this was a true disappointment to what was once a revolutionary franchise. I will spare you all the details for the sake of not writing an article.If you're a true fan of the original trilogy you can do yourself a favor by skipping this one. However if you must see this film do so with very low expectations beyond seeing some cool, if not overdone action sequences.",4
1510,"The Matrix was a great film, the original 2 sequels were kind of boring with all the Zion politics but had some great sequences in them.....but this feels like a slap in the face.The film is TOO META. There is literally a part where Jonathan Groff says ""Warner Bros wants a sequel whether you develop it or not' and I swear to God, that must be how this film came about. WB wanted a sequel, the wachowskis didnt but also didnt want to have someone else's name on their creation so they were backed into a corner making this. And decided to give a very hap hazard lazy story that too much follows the original...down to relying on showing too many flashbacks. There was a board/pitch meeting scene in particular that I swear to god, I nearly got up and left from rolling my eyes so much. This movies also lazily dumps Smith and the Exiles. They just randomly disappear. And the Neo/trinity stuff felt super corny too.The only thing I kind of liked was exploring themes of mental illness and there was one joke that got a laugh out of me. But thats about it.",4
1511,"Ok so I know there's a lot bad reviews out there and some are good. I personally loved this movie, I am a big Matrix fan and am old enough to of seen all of them when they released in theatres in the 90s and early 2000s and have seen the movies 100s of times.This movie has gone in a completely different direction which it needed to be to be fresh, the first act I must say was a bit bizarre and came across as some sort of parody you would get on SNL and kinda threw me and I'm not sure if I actually like act one but I'm sure it will grow on me. I found myself thinking oh no if the whole movie is like this then it's going to be awful! Luckily things turned around.When Neo takes the Red pill things change in a great way, no more SNL humour and now back to the Matrix. The new city was stunning (in my opinion) and I loved the new characters specially bugs and the new cute robots. The movie is 2hrs 30mins roughly and felt like 20mins felt way to quick. I really enjoyed the cameos here and there and the new Morpheus and how they brought him back.Difficult not to say to much but I don't want to ruin it for anyone.The ending left for a chance for more but with the bad reviews I think the franchise is done which is a huge shame as I really wanted to see more of the new characters which are really likeable.To finish, if your a Matrix fan, it's really different so you won't get those wow moments from the previous films but if you can get passed the first act you might love it as much as me. Enjoy.",10
1512,"Fully wasn't expecting the entire cast of Sense8 to appear in this. Some great actors, but overall it doesn't hold a candle to the trilogy that came before. I feel like Keanu hardly even speaks in this...which is weird for a main character. Though at times I felt was for the best. I love the dude but his acting in this wasn't great. Dialogue/writing is also to blame. I dunno. While it's not something I'd watch again, it was fun to revisit the world and I feel a sense of gratitude for the efforts made.. so I'm giving it a 5.",5
1513,The first half of this movie was quite frankly awful. Have you ever had the feeling that they make a movie just for a paycheck? That's the way I felt. I'm so glad I watched this movie free on HBO Max. The 2nd half was a little better but not much. .,4

I loved The Matrix, absolutely hated 2+3, so I had no idea what to expect with 4.I was, overall, pleasantly surprised.What I didn't like:-New Agent Smith gets a ""boo!"" No need to recast that part. The game designer owner could have been played by Hugo Weaving...why the heck not?-Some of the fight sequences looked a little too much like sparring.-I think the film was missing one more ""it's not real I'm going nuts"" sequence from Neo. The audience ""knew"" The Matrix was real a bit too soon IMO.What I did like:-I enjoyed the new Morpheus. The actor did a fine job.-Cinematography was beautiful at times.What I loved:-Trinity and Neo back again.Ultimately Matrix fans, Lana ""knew"" she messed up the original trilogy by killing Trinity and Neo. Yes, this film was all a big ""retcon"" to bring back Trinity and Neo from the grave.I, as a Matrix 1 fan, and thrilled she did.",8
1516,"Where to start... this was just a dumpster fire. It felt like a B-movie that a student film maker made on a shoestring budget, but with zero vision. The special effects were poorly rendered and the makeup ""head gear/body gadgets"" looked like foam steam punk art that had been glued onto the actors. The sound design and cinematography were poorly orchestrated, and just felt like the director had zero vision or control over the film. Avoid and don't waste your time.",4
1517,"Well, to be honest you can find some good things even in this movie. If you put aside the story, music and acting can be ranked as decent. But acting and story are intertwined and influence each other.I disliked this ""PART"" of Matrix when I saw the trailer. And watching the movie I grew confident. In my opinion, the camera work and choice of colors is ruining everything from first seconds. And it i not just ""Look, this is new Matrix by Sati"". Poor action, too much of close-up faces, cut view of decrations - all pf these add to negative impression.And, of course. The plot. Actully I saw no plot t all. What who, why? All of this is so messed up... Authors put some phrases they saw in fan theories, but not too much. As a result there is no idea, no storytelling. Just obsessed adventure to go out of the Matrix.I question - who really wrote original Matrix?",1

Perhaps the very idea of this part has a place to be, but its implementation is very, very bad. It looks extremely cheap. I am very disappointed. It would be better if this part did not exist. At least in this implementation... The Wachowskis created a masterpiece, and the Wachowskis destroyed it.",2
1522,This was one film I really really wanted to be awesome! But it's so slow and boring it's nearly impossible to watch. None of the characters are likeable other than neo and trinity. Proving new talent these days are so disposable. Keanu dances around a thread of a story like a ghost documenting a fantastic past that no longer exists. I just feel sorry for his hair!,4
1523,"Self aware of how bad really is. It even reference WB about the new sequel being made just to make money. While it tries to be movie about doubts of the reality of Anderson's live, it's still average movie if we ignore the Matrix thing altogether. But it must be Matrix 4, but wasn't the movie we wanted, happy end? At what cost? I don't want to remember this as the ""Matrix"". If you like the movies don't watch this one.",3
1524,Movie lacked everything in terms of originality. Typical forced sequel that panders to the current climate of woke culture for the monies while offering nothing exciting or new from an artistic filmmaking standpoint. This movie could've been great but it didn't even come close.,1
1525,"The film is a symbol of the excessive demands of the makers. The main thing is to squeeze in as much fancy as possible, which then seems far-fetched. The film also gives no time for images and ideas to take effect. Also, no tension is created by the hectic pace.The minimalism and precision from the first part is missing. There is no Matrix atmosphere.And if a serious film has to work with jokes, then everything is clear.With a series, the missing 200 minutes of explanation could have been sorted out somehow.",3
1526,"(Watched during the Canadian Premiere on Dec 16th 2021)Return to a world of two realities: one, everyday life; the other, what lies behind it. To find out if his reality is a construct, to truly know himself, Mr. Anderson will have to choose to follow the white rabbit once more. (Source: IMDb)The Matrix resurrections is a return of one of the greatest Sci-Fi stories and franchises of all time after nearly 20 years. Director Lana Wachowski returns to direct the fourth film. However, the film is very unnecessary and lacks a few times especially the first act that is very long and mostly boring. At times, the film felt like it is mocking or making fun of some famous lines, sequences, or even characters of the original first film. The film is very long, 2h 28m could've easily been comprised. Almost every scene or sequence is long which leads to audience members losing interest and not paying attention to the action and events. Action sequences are very long and would go on and on which luckily the action movements done by actors and stunts saved the scene from being dead.The opening scene alongside the first act of the film is very boring and does not grab any attention, which is a huge problem for a film that is returning after 18 years since its last part. A film like that should have a solid opening scene and first act that would keep everyone hooked. In addition to action sequences being long, dialogues are as well, which is even worse. Very few dialogue scenes are entertaining and important in terms of the events of the film like the ones in the third act which is the best act. At times, characters' purpose In specific scenes is to make the audience laugh. However, the opposite occurred due to the weak script and performance by some of the actor at times.It is always great to see Keanu Revees return as Neo or Thomas Anderson in The Matrix. Keanu always puts on a solid performance in any film. I think Keanu is the only good thing about this film. Although the film revolves around Carrie-Anne Moss' character Trinity, she is barely in the film. Her onscreen time is very limited which is weird cause the story is literally about her. The only thing that can be said about Yahya Abdul-Mateen playing Morpheus is that it is the most stupid and unnecessary thing in the whole film. Morpheus is such a classic character played by an amazing actor in the previous trilogy, so why ruin that?! The character was not even seen much in the film as It was mostly seen through an A. I. and not Yahya himself physically playing the role.In addition, the CGI is very bad. I feel like the first Matrix that was made in 1999 had a better CGI compared to the time of its release than the Matrix 4 that is released in the year 2021. The music alongside is very basic and taken/inspired by the previous parts of The Matrix. The cinematography worked perfectly alongside the production design to capture some beautiful and visually stunning shots.Towards the end, you realize that the whole time the film was trying to turn into a superhero kind of film where someone needs to be saved. It also turns into a romantic film where one character has to make sacrifices and choices to save their loved ones.The Matrix Resurrections should've never been resurrected. It is very unnecessary and not well made. However, it is still great to see Keanu back again and to see this whole franchise returning after almost 18 years.My rating is 6.5/10.",6
1527,"This movie is just lazy in comparison to the originals and even in comparison to other action movies. Bad plot, bad changes to the existing narrative. Just bad.",1
1528,"Frustrating is the word that may describe the movie. Can NOT believe they did to Matrix this. After I watched Matrix Resurrections I concluded that a least for me, It exists and will exist just as a Trilogy (Matrix, Matrix Reloaded, and Matrix Revolutions.) This is NOT part of the Matrix Series. This is a Joke. PLEASE don´t do another movie like this and name it Matrix. Just call it whatever you want, but NO Matrix, PLEASE.",1
1529,"I even laughed while watching this. Nearly everything that happened at the movie was so meaningless. Guess I didn't watch Matrix. I watched a terrible parody and maybe that's why we couldn't see the actual Morpheus and Agent Smith. I'm not just talking about the actors. I'm also talking about how they showed us the characters. I guess the writer was too angry to the ""marketing"" while writing the movie.",1
1530,"The Matrix was great. The 2nd one was fine. The 3rd wasn't good. This 4th one isn't even a movie.The plot almost doesn't exsistant. There is conflict, of course, but their is no real dilemma here except that which the characters make for themselves. The special effects are awful and the fight sequences are not only dull but frustrating and unimaginative.The acting is poor. It's a bad movie when Keanu Reeves is the best actor(and I love him btw). The new characters are forgettable. In fact there is no chara ter development at all. Neo is even muted and is a sad sack. Trinity is more powerful without any explanation.The movie suffers in its decision choices much in the same way the new Star Wars trilogy did. Direction is too selfish for it to appeal to most audiencs I suspect.",4
1531,"Great way to spend Christmas evening, communing with old friends in trouble again! Is this a 10? Probably not; closer to an 8 or 9. But I rated it 10 to offset all the idiot 1's, 2's and 3's who didn't even bother to finish the movie. Yes, I was disappointed that Fishburne and Weaving were absent, but Abdul-Mateen and Groff were great! In fact all the acting was great, and the movie concept was unique and satisfying. I definitely felt like I was back in the matrix again! I just don't understand all the hyper-critical haters...PS I see all the presumably male reviews who object to this movie being ""woke"" because Trinity can fly. HA, what a simplistic, ignorant viewpoint! The One is just the beginning; two or more people are always more powerful; and if not only Neo, but also Trinity, has supernatural powers, then it naturally follows that all people have supernatural abilities somewhere inside them, which could lead to the defeat of the evil Machines!",10
1532,"This movie tries to straddle the line between satire and a serious sci-fi/action movie but ends up accomplishing neither. The plot is convoluted and pretentious. It's hard to understand how the main characters are still alive (the actors playing Morpheus and Smith are significant downgrades), what happened to the old matrix, and why any aspect of the story is still compelling or relevant. I give this a 4 purely out of nostalgia - and the fact that it tries to be progressive.",4
1533,"I never write reviews as I usually just read them but this movie triggered me so much that I felt compelled to create an account to voice my opinion! Matrix 4 disturbed my spirit so much I actually left the cinema angry for the 1st time ever.The good:Acting: the acting was well executed. I recognize many of the actors and despite many flaws with the actual characters the actors are supposed to represent the acting itself was impressive, especially when it comes to Trinity.Mostly good:Visual: several shots were very impressive such as the views of Machine City and Io, but sadly none of these scenes convey the same awe and atmosphere as in the previous movies. This especially true for Io.The Bad:Story: this is by far the biggest flaw in the movie. Lana needs to understand that no matter how good the actors and visuals are, BAD WRITING NEVER WINS! This sequel has a plot that is small in scope, as before we had all of humanity at stake but here a sense of urgency is completely lost. The plot seems to have been scaled down to 2 people. The plot doesn't answer inconsistencies from the previous films such as the reason neo had powers in the real world or the oracles real intentions and motives. The plot present new elements which add complexity but don't answer anything. Neo and Trinity are saved but the actual reasons are poorly explained, Trinity has powers as we see a shift from ""the 1"" to ""the pair"" but an actual explanation is absent. This is made worse by the fact that Trinity's power seem to come out of nowhere and the audience has no opportunity to grow into the idea at all. A proper explanation is missing. The low level of security around Trinity's pod is too incompetent to expect from an AI and just seems like a Deus Ex Machina solution to plot problem Lana herself created. The entire atmosphere and sense of awe is lost and the multiple flashbacks to other movies only makes the audience wish the movie was better, it creates a sense of longing and dissatisfaction. The movies seems like satire and feels NOTHING like the previous movies and more like a zombie movie. The ending presents no explanation as to what will happen to the matrix, it is vague with random talk of change, nonsensical and very out of character behavior from the Neo and Trinity. This plot did not present closure but only opened a Pandora's box of confusion.The characters:The Analyst seems clumsy and goofy; very inappropriate for an AI with such an important position. He felt more like a jester. The new Morpheus barely drives the story forward and the new Smith feels nothing like the old 1. The blue haired girl was utterly disinteresting and it was frustrating to see so much focus on her as most fans honestly DON'T CARE about her! Niobe's character was wasted and Neo never truly returned.The action:this movie is cluster of shaky-cam to the point that it seems that it was filmed during an earthquake. There is no way of understanding what is happening! The swarm thing turns Matrix into a zombie movie where people just mindlessly charge at the heroes. Do NOT expect iconic fighting scenes.This was a cornucopia of incompetence and Lana should issue a public apology to the entire fanbase!",2
1534,"I never thought I could be so disappointed by a movie from the Matrix series. But hey, consumerism. Give us your money and see how we destroy what was probably the most memorable and life altering movie you ever watched. See us how we copy/paste every scene from the first movie into the new one, and then laugh at it. We will fire at your cliché after cliché and turn every character into a joke, because we know you will come an see it anyway.Trinity is now a boring housewife that at some point unexpectedly discovers how to fly. Neo is in the role of a slightly senile Rapunzel, eventually taken on a ride by the former housewife. Agent Smith is now a post-dot-com era, ruthless tech entrepreneur that beats the crap out of Neo and Trinity, until, suddenly and for no clear reason the good guys win? Then there is the psychiatrist, that really annoying replacement for The Architect, contoured like an all-powerful rich kid, just so he can poke fun at all the nice things that were in the original movie. This one too, for no apparent reason, is left with a wide-open jaw, dropping right at the movie ending.Bad, bad, bad...",1
1535,What in in the world is Priyanka Chopra doing in this? LMAO!I just laughed so hard. Was this a comedy version? What happened to Leo's fighting skills? The main character was a sleep. This was more like Woketrix.,5
1536,The Matrix trilogy was given to us when two geeky brothers invited us into their SF fever dreams.Ressurections is what we get when one sister regrets having shared those dreams with us.,5
1537,"Priceless, neither beginning nor end. The story is very poor. Very very very bad. Why was Trinity chosen? And why did Neo get on a small bench? Why isn't it clear why they survived? Too many questions but no answers.",1
1538,"About 20 years after the Matrix trilogy, the sequel comes after all. Anyone who is a Matrix fan should be happy. Many should be fascinated by what could bring Neo back.The creators did a good job and old favorites like Neo/Keanu Reeves and Trinity/Carrie-Anne Moss have actually returned. A shame that Morpheus was newly cast. The story is fun to follow and nothing is missing that has already been seen in the old movies. I recorded everything in the cinema with fascination. I liked that this movie described the love between Neo and Trinity as the driving force. Matrix has evolved and that's because everything that lives moves on. All the haters have to understand that, because life develops and does not dance to every tune.If you don't like Matrix then just don't watch this movie and leave the connoisseurs in peace. In my opinion very good movie and it gets the maximum number of stars from me.",10
1539,"This movie sucks. If fishburne was in it maybe it would be worth buying. If I didn't have max, I wouldn't have paid a dime. Sad they couldn't bring back Laurence. His Iconic voice is everything to Morpheus. Idc how old he is, he would have potentially saved this movie. I'm disappointed that according to fishburne they didn't even try to bring him back.",2
1540,"I'll give this film credit; It did try to do some new things. But then it inexplicably departed from that new, interesting direction it was tantalizingly close to taking and went back to doing what it was doing before, which was not so good.I thought the overall finished product was a lot less than I would expect of a Matrix remake. It is pretty awful from the very start. The story is completely flat right out of the gate. I don't know why some of these characters were even in the movie. Morpheus especially. Were we just afraid to do a Matrix movie without Morpheus? I don't know why his character was necessary to the story.The story did briefly get interesting around 15 minutes in after a surprising twist, then they abandoned their fresh new idea right in front of the audience's eyes, then the movie devolved into a lot of boring rehashing that was completely pointless filler and a lot of characters soapboxing or explaining what's happening.The plot is a convoluted mess, but I could understand what the director was trying to say. Far, far too much time is spent rehashing the previous events of past films instead of advancing a new plot...",6
1541,"The approach to the continuation of the story was terrible. The writing was horrific. The atmosphere of the movie was completely off, no longer grungy and gritty, felt like the Disney adaptation of Starwars. Lacks soul.",1
1542,"I really don't feel like it's a spoiler to say that this film shamelessly re-used clips from the previous films. Unbelievably tacky and lazy.Beyond that major failure, the story here had SOME potential, but it wasn't properly realized and ultimately fell flat. Cliché, I know, but it's true.To clarify that point, the ""reality"" of the Matrix is that if you're not ""real"" over ""there"", then the whole world is your oyster. We got some tastes of this in the prior sequels, but it never was truly capitalized on. So I had high hopes for this film that we would finally see something epic. Maybe a cross between Dark City, Tron and Inception? Nope, nothing down that path.Another option, would it have killed the writers to have the machines explore other worlds or push the boundaries of space/time/existence? NOPE, nothing there either.Probably the only place for ""The Matrix"" property to ""resurrect"" itself is a prequel or a TV series, hopefully with a new crew who knows how to make decent sci-fi.Oh, lastly, the plot holes were massive. Unplug me now...",5
1543,They destroyed the trilogy like they did with stars wars.The movie is predictable and badly written. And even the cinematography is not well made. Totally different from the original trilogy. Its seems just a money grab movie. Its just amazing how Hollywood can destroy iconic movies.,1
1544,"Aside from a couple of bright points in the film it was a let down. Man, what could have been so great was just horrifying how badly it was done.I liked implementing characters from the past into the present, but the way it was done rarely made realistic sense. Taking shots at how Neo wasn't the hero he actually was, at least how I took it, was rude.The action scenes? When you flash so quickly going from one fight to another it goes from watching a fight scene to simply noise. I rest my head on my fist and sigh, waiting for the silly boring noise to end. You can't tell what is going on. It is not entertaining. There was nothing unique in any of the fights.The bottom line is I felt let down. Very disappointed. A great story was butchered. And at the end I was almost asking ""So, Neo isn't Neo now or what?"" and that sounds stupid.Going forward I would either do a remake of this movie with one that isn't garbage or call the Matrix line dead. Doing it a disservice continuing in this manner isn't okay.",5
1545,"That's how I felt throughout this whole films action sequences. So messy, so laughably bad, SO MUCH POTENTIAL.I'm not going to fart in its mouth too much because the concept I liked (Morpheus I didn't) and the story made sense, I feel. It was just a MESS NOISE AND LIGHTS. The one thing that set matrix apart from all other modern a tion films was left in the toilet here and just had a smelly, old man's toe stuck up its bum.I truly believes there's. 5-6 cut of this film that exists and its great. Give us that. We will pay.Ps: RIP Wilfred Brambell. Legend.",6
1546,"It's back to the Matrix roots and only has a slight, tranny flair that Lana couldn't escape from. I guess, all her sibling brought to the table was extra restraint, which might have made this film better, but it's hard to know.Matrix 2 and 3 were disappointments for me, but people that liked them, will appreciate this movie because it builds on top of the story of those movies, too.It's fun. It has a story to tell, and its repetition isn't as bad the Star Wars rehashes, because repetition is part of the story of The Matrix.It has flaws, but not too many. I think this movie will be enjoyed by nearly everyone.The ending is a bit gay, but nothing to ruin the story, unlike most other Hollywood movies out there.This is a pretty good third-sequel, which isn't saying much.",7
1547,"Those 4 stars were for the VFX team because they did such an amazing job. As for the rest : -10Apart from this this movie was a big failure. I waited a whole year for this and 2 hours for it to get better.Here are the issues:1. Matrix is not a comedy but this one added meaningless jokes2. Neo had powers but this one abused it. Literally all of Neo's fight scenes uses force push.3. VFX is amazing, in fact it is one of the best I have seen yet I felt nothing during the movie.4. No soundtracks. I could make better soundtracks and I am tone deaf.5. End credit music was not even a music. It was some lady shouting some words. Compare that to the master piece of the trilogy and it is criminal to even put it in the movie.6. 30% of the movie is just the trilogy thrown around at the viewer in such a lazy way that there is zero connection between them and the actual movie.7. Exiles were shown but if you remove them from the movie, it wont make a difference!8. No Morpheus, No Agent Smith.9. POST CREDIT SCENE ABOUT CAT VIDEOS. Enough is enough. We got it. You made your jokes about cat videos. This is Matrix, not a chic flick movie.10. Movie showcased various locations in various countries yet it didnt feel like it.11. Force Push again, all fight scenes is Neo using force push or stopping bullets. Original Matrix he did bullet time and stopping bullets, Matrix 2 he learned how to fly, Matrix 3 he fought billions of agent smiths. This one he just kept stopping bullets and force push but not even with confidence. Seemed like someone told Keanu just hold your hands in front of you as you run and we add stuff during the edit.I am really disappointed.",4
1548,"Imagine neo stabbing at a mirror with a knife like a young jake gyllenhaal. This could have been dark, mysterious, great. Think Darko meets the joker. Is he in the matrix or going mad? Eheu. Alas....! In reality the plot was written by a 2yr old fan boy. So much talk. No cool scenes. Pathetic parody of itself a little like jay and silent bob strikes back... but even worse if that is possible. The action scenes are pathetic.",2
1549,"I gave this a 7/10 because there is more I liked than I didn't. I felt like the progression of the story was slow, and they did spend a lot of time remaking old nostalgic scenes from the past. I did like a lot of the new things they added although nothing felt groundbreaking about it. Yet I'm still so torn because I loved it. I felt similar to when I watched the original trilogy, it gave you a lot to think about. I want to watch it again because I feel like this is something I need to absorb at least twice.",7
1550,"The Matrix resurrectionsI've got to hand it to the creators of this film - a very well done job.Unfortunately, many isle who see this, think they should write their reviews immediately - 'gotta be the first'.Like wine, films, and books need to be thought about, ruminated, before must understand something.I say this because I'm saddened this film's (initial) score is what it is (I'm NOT going to write it, because I'm hoping - over time - it'll change.The story is true Matrix, and with it are the state-of-tomorrow special effects which made the original a landmark film.The writers didn't do a 'a o bad job. A lot of care and though we'v went into this. There's references upon references upon references (for those who remember the first film, it can make this one like looking at a hall of mirrors through a hall of mirrors.I'm NOT the only one who think humanity's become... well, let's just say is gotten a lot stranger in the past decade plus, and there's a terrific scene in which a group of people working on the new Matrix sequel, Binary, start babbling in that bizarre form of speech which has run rampant - talking about 'on-brand', and all of that other ridiculous Orwellian-like new-speak (reminds me; is it live it is it...?')Reality's bent into Matrix reality, and the 'pinnings' into 'our' reality (there's a reference upon references early in talking about the Matrix game trilogy - and the film trilogy - and the grumblings of the 'parent company' (that being...Warner Bros), can actually make one wonder; is this a 'film'?It's fun to watch Morpheus quoting himself (from the original film - which is simultaneously being seen), and chuckling, at his earlier histrionics. When they're attempting to get Mr Anderson to safety, Morpheus (again, with Mr Fishburne's original being seen simultaneously) begins to quote him, and then just goes, 'blah, blah, blah'. Very funnyIt's great to see the people from the original, and see them as they are (even though this is in the Matrix), and not looking ... 'artificially enhanced' (i.e, plastic surgery, etc), and have them act 'real' (i know what I'm saying might seem a bit confusing, but when you see the film, it becomes clearer).This is one of the very few sequels I'd reccommend wholeheartedly.",
1551,"This movie was all about picking up the pieces and putting them back together. Which makes sense and doesn't take away from what happened in the last movie. It makes the sacrifice worth it and reinforces the power of The One. While one movie may seem excessive to get Neo back into it, it would also seem rushed if it took any less time. Because what's happened in the last 60 years is very well set up.It's funny because so many sequels to twenty plus year old movies fall into the same trap of basically remaking the first one. And this does it so genuinely by hitting it head on. They don't beat around the bush or anything, they crash into it. Like the two semi trucks in Reloaded. It's actually part of the story. And very naturally I might add. All of the reasons for things either coming back or being the way they are, are very good.The reason Neo is kept alive, or brought back to life (I always thought he didn't die at the end of the last one. But here we are) is very good and completely fits in with The Matrix. And it makes sense that they would want to keep him suppressed for what he gives them but that he would still be Neo. That he would tell his life's story because he hasn't forgotten, he just thinks he has. His perception of the truth has been altered. Which is a giant theme in the Matrix. I also like that Trinity was given more. She is more important to Neo than just being his squeeze. They are linked and are ""The One"" together, or something. Whatever it was it reinforced the love theme from the last movies.Neil Patrick Harris was a great choice for an unknown bad guy. He's inherently likeable and unassuming. But he's a good enough actor that he can act bad and it's not cheesy or bad.This was The Matrix on a budget, but it didn't seem cheap. We just didn't get any of the mind blowing Wachowski innovations that we're used to. I know that they have lost some clout in recent years since they just can't seem to get a hit. Unfortunately, because I thought that everything they've done has been great. So I think this movie was a way for them, or Lana to get in good graces with WB again. I really hope it works so we can not only get Matrix movies but also more Wachowski movies. Because their eye and innovations are what's missing from movies now. And I think we can all agree that movies have sucked for a while because of this.The new technology was very cool. Like how things in The Matrix could be in the real world. That was a very cool look. All the little balls floating around. And being able to break apart to go into small places was cool. The green code thing in their eyes was cool. And Neo's force push was cool. So was all of their new technology. I also like how things have been sinceLike how they work with some machines now and all that. And when Neo is fighting Smith and runs in a circle on the wall was very cool. I think really the only thing I'd never really seen before was when people were jumping out of buildings trying to hit them.Basically this movie was a lot of resetting and setting up what's to come, while also being a movie that works all on it's own. So many movies these days are unsatisfying because you have to see the next one. But Lana is smart enough to know that you can't blue ball an audience. Hey, Reloaded/Revolutions was planned as a single movie cut in half. Unfortunately, we weren't told this and had to figure it out for ourselves.I hope people watch this twice and realize that it was never going to be the first one and just take it for what it is so we get more. Because what will happen is that they'll hate it because they're nostalgia addicts and then a few years later they'll watch it and realize how good it was. But it'll be too late and the plug will have been pulled on this fantastic franchise. I can't wait to see what else can be done. Because you know this was made to get the audience back and the next one will blow you away and do what's never been done before. At the very least this is a very well done, well written movie worthy of The Matrix name. And we should consider ourselves lucky to get a movie like this these days.",10
1552,"A depressing, messy allegory/commentary on the repetitive drudgery and banality of modern day life and its modern social methods of control (i,e social media). That sacrifices the franchise, using nostalgia for the franchise itself as the trojan horse to deliver its subtext. There's no escapism offered here. The movie is self-referential to the point of feeling like it's breaking the fourth wall. It goes out its way to remind you of modern social dynamics brought on by the current state of social media. There were far more interesting things going on in the background that could've been explored. But the movie seemed more obsessed preaching at fans of something they're already well aware of, rather than entertaining them. Masquerading this movie as a love story seems disingenuous with all the on the nose criticism it dishes out.The action/choreography was subpar and not worthy of the franchise. The sets felt cheap. And overall it felt extremely sloppy compared to the originals.Unlike the original matrix, the latest installment won't pass the test of time. And it seems done that way by design.",4
1553,Who directed this? I feel like the Power Rangers was a better movie. I can't even find the right words to how boring this was and I watched all of it... need those mins back. Just awful.,1
1554,Truly unbelievably bad movie. At first I thought to myself that ok it is that bad that maybe I should consider it as a comedy and maybe laugh at it..it wasn't even possible to do that... such a disappointment for a movie that literally made history in the world cinematography scene.,1
1555,"Second and Third matrix was bad, but this movie feel like B-class copy of it....Its badly made, fighting scenes feel like forced mess. Characters are flat as Reeves acting skills.

1556,"It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but I just don't understand why it had to exist.I think you can tell just watching it that there just isn't the passion behind it that there was 20 years ago. Nothing about this is as well crafted as the original trilogy. Not the cinematography, not the plot, not the editing, not the dialogue, not the acting, not the action scenes, not the sets. Not the music, I'd maybe even say the same about the effects. The themes that ran deeply through the original trilogy of destiny and personal choice are barely given lip service, and not replaced with anything else resonant or of substance.It doesn't further any of the main characters arcs, and it doesn't seem to start any new ones beyond the simplistic fan-service of ""Look, Neo and Trinity are back!"" and ""Look! The humans are allies with some of the machines now"".I would have liked to have seen where else they could go with the franchise, but none of what I saw in Resurrections seemed necessary. None of it feels worthy of waking the franchise from its long slumber.",2

1558,"Intentionally spelled wrong, because this is a trick.It's like Wachowski doesn't understand what the Matrix movies is. It's laughable, bland, doesn't share the aestetic of the other movies, it tries to be new, ultra woke, which indeed introduces something new and thought provoking at times.But isn't the Matrix movies supposed to be cool? What about the color scheme that gives you a sense of other worldlyness, something that's dystopian.Let's skip that, let's use colorful funny sunglasses, skip the cool leather attires, now it's aaaaaalll colors, which I think is fine, unless it's the matrix.It's green (you get that at the title screen), it's cool (leather, sun glasses, suits), it has a conflict (savior that needs to save humankind).Ressurections is not green(crisp clear with lots of color), it is not cool (Zero leather and it brings your mind to Hooks (the film wit Robin Williams where he is Peter pan and also Goku with his kamikameha from dragonball (which I love but it's not what I want when I watch the matrix))), and the conflict is to save a love interest to endanger human kind and Neo cares NOTHING HUMANKIND.SO yeah. Bland boring wokeness with a few interesting clips from the trilogy where it was good. The clips from previous movies are the best parts of the new movie.",3
1559,"This movie looks nothing like the originals, although the plot is somewhat funny, which means that both cinematography and script are nothing like the original matrix trilogy...",6
1560,Absolutely disappointing continuation of this epic story. I was very disappointed with this file and felt there was so much opportunity to build onto the great story.,3
1561,Besides the meta part on the first act (which still was a bit too much) this film was just bad. The storyline was too week (especially for a matrix movie). The final act of the movie was walking dead with force fields.,1
1562,"Remember Star Wars episodes I-III? How we compared them to the original trilogy at the time of release, and for some years thought that prequels were pretty bad.Then The Force Awakens came out. And it turned out that prequels were not that bad after all.Well, now turns out that Matrix 2 and 3 are also not that bad.",4
1563,Really enjoyed and once again Keanu Reeves deliversThe story was fantastic and very clever I hope they do another one cause it could still do so much more.,10
1564,"It is rehashing old concepts and visuals and put them into 2021 and then... nothing. Why ?Firstly, because there is already Matrix from 1999 if you want to approach those interesting concepts of reality, identity, dreams, humanity, AI, etc. This movie adds nothing from our own era that could be clever or really useful to the story.Secondly, from the visual point, of course it has its charm (sometimes), but nothing revolutionnary like the trilogy during its time.Finally, the story, at its core, is just the same as the first one, so what's the point ?I am very dissapointed. I will rewatch the original Matrix right now. You should do the same.",3
1565,"Seems this is some ordinary fantasy movie. Butterflies, cockroaches and some bad acting ,fights and xartoonish cgi. But original matrix was way more than that. Watchowoskis lost since the last matrix trilogy.",3
1566,"Ummm ... well that was 3 hours of my lifei will neverget back.... I was soo absolutely pumped to see this only to be left with confusion and despair... I thought that having the original directors, keanu, trinity, and 20 years to perfect this would make this epic.... I did not know that lawrence fiishburn was not in this ( wasnt even asked to reprise his role in fact), wasnt aware that doogie howser could just annoy me throughout the movie, or that the real agent smith was not in this.... Those reasons plus a terrible skript absolutely destroyed this movie..... Its one hot mess with a couple of cool scenes but too long and confusing... Save your money and wait for it to be on TBS or TNT.",5
1567,"The Matrix franchise is something I cherish with unbroken love. My first contact with the movies were in 2003, when the advertisement campaign started, so TV channels aired the first movie. It came in the right time, in the right age for me, that's for sure, and for this reason i'm never disappointed or angry, when someone say they don't like Matrix. That time i weren't even 18 age old, so most of the meaning behind those words and acts remained unnoticed for me. Yet it struck. As i grew older i started to realise this movie is so much more. So much meaning behind every line, every act. Capturing this distopian future, the struggle... And with characters written with such finesse. I'm not blinded by pure affection. In the same time it's an action movie with giant machines, and kung-fu, but even these things are not simply just for the show. Every fight scene is composed masterfully. But i'm not writing a review for a Matrix box set. I'm writing a review for the 4th movie.I were afraid of this movie. I'm gona sit once more in a movie theatre, and gona watch Matrix i never saw before. With childish hope I were waiting for a new Matrix for 18 years. After seeing how disappointed people are after resurrected -haha, such pun- titles in the past years i were afraid. Bringing back Neo were there for 18 years in the head of Whachowskis. They already wrote something simmilar in the script of the MMO, so i had high hopes, the story of the 4th movie is gona be well written, as maybe they are polishing it for almost two decade. I heard the script mostly made in grief of their loss, and also that Lilly Wachowski felt it a bad idea to making it, but i still hoped.The movie started. And i let out a faint sigh. The beginning made me reassure, that it's still a Matrix. Not the dark, harsh matrix i knew, but it were inevitable and a good thing. Revolutions ended with bringing something new, and they stayed true for that. The green tint disappeared, which already took away most of the unease feeling the previous simulation gave, but looks like we are in the version Neo brought to us.I were afraid of Bugs. Knew nothing about the actor, that side i never cared about, as long as they can act, but from the trailers she seemed more like a fan fiction character someone written into their own story. This is the biggest and best surprise of the movie. She is almost the only one having decent character arc in this movie. And i guess i'm not even far from the fanfiction thing. She is exactly how we all would act seeing (and from here comes some minor spoilers) Neo, or even something connected to him. Jessica Henwick acts so well. For me her impression is like a child girl adoring his father she never saw, just heard stories about, yet still sneak into he's old workroom, and fantasies about her father great acts. It were superb. Translating how a fan feels about him felt so good. Maybe it's her hungarian dub, that boosted this feeling for me, but even without that, her character fits into my picture.My second fear were Morpheus. I saw the Watchmen series, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's acting were really good. So again i were not afraid of the actor, i were afraid of the role. Laurence Fishburne's absence hurt almost as much as someone else's but let's come back to this later. I felt really bad about him, as he is still active, and seemed like he wanted to take the role. Apart from this, this new morpheus is good, but felt unnecessary. Not the role, but calling him Morpheus. He is totally different. Even in the movie he admits he is not entirely Morpheus, as he is some crossing of what Neo(?) thinks about Smith and Morpheus, and wrote into a video game inside the matrix, that somehow evolved into the Matrix, mixing the traits of two of these characters being so different were a cool idea, but sadly it dies in the first half hour. After that he does nothing reminding of Smith, or even Morpheus. He is a new character, and as this should have deserved a new name.And here comes something i were shocked abut, and marks mostly the point where my hopes goes downhill. Jonathan Groff's Smith. I kept myself spoiler-free as much as possible, but from the last trailers it were obvious, that he is the new Smith. And here comes what hurt the most. Hugo Weaving. He's work as Agent Smith is superb. He made the impression of something you have to fear of. When he entered the scene, you felt that he is sent by the matrix to eradicate what is considered danger to the simulation. And this feeling multiplied by dozens, as he became an ""exile"".Jonathan's Smith is really again just a name. He's kind face, and designer suit have nothing reminding me of the original. When you look at him, your biggest fear is that he is gonna sel you stock you don't wana buy. It is hard if not impossible to live up to the legacy of Hugo Weaving, so it's again not the actor's fault. More like the writing's. Sometimes seems like even he is adoring Neo. Which is kinda true for the first 3 movie also, as Smith and Neo had a relation like this. But the original Smith always made us feel the hatred he felt about this connection between them.The crew of the Mnemosyne is good., but have close to zero story arc, which i mostly understand, as this is not two movie, like Reloaded and Revolution, where they had the time to make a side story for Zee and Link which is some of the best part of the third movie if you asks me, or even for Kid. They have some lines, mostly to see how they feel about Neo, or to give us some perspective of what changed after Neo's death, but it's rushed. It had so much more in it. One of them, not even sure if Berg or FunktIøn (This can be my lack of skill jointing faces to names quickly, or just the fact, that they have this much screentime) mentions he is part of something like a religion, believing something simmilar what Morpheus did, but it's more specific, as not for the Choosen one, but for Neo's returning. I tought Neo's returning... well, more like arriving to IO would make a scene simmilar to the original trilogy where everyone brought him gifts in thanks for simply existing, or to asks his favor of protecting loved ones. That moment were a really good one. Showing how the symbol outgrow the person, and even twists it in some way, as most people only heard about him, but never met him, making Neo some kind of deity, whose favour can be win by offers. Io is not Zion, but people fighting at the Dock for Zion were mostly young adults. Most of them still alive, and can be in Io. But even if it's not, we are one generation away from this fight. If you were fighting against annihilation, and someone sacrifices himself to save the whole mankind, i'm damn sure you are still telling those stories to your kids. Even the botanist woman mentions everyone already know, that he is here. At least in Jude we see a glimpse of what i wanted. Sequoia, the new operator bears the traits of previous ones, but apart from also being in the Neo fan club, he have nothing else. Sad, as in the previous movies operators were interresting characters, usually providing small glimpses about the life in the real world. One thing made it even more bittersweet, is that i'm almost sure, the same guy voiced Link in the hungarian version.We also have machine crew. It's again nothing new. Animatrix had it, Reloaded and Revolutions had it. Councillor Hamann speaking with Neo makes it clear to us, that machines are keeping Zion running, even without their free will, or having any consciousness. It's a nice they countinued the idea. 60 years makes some technical advancements, and already in the trilogy Neo already influenced the programs in the Matrix. The Keymaker wanted to help Neo. The Oracle even mentions to Neo, that he made her a believer. Looks like in the machine city more programs and actual Machines think, a consens coexistence is a good thing. Overall it's a good thing, until a point. Because for me it became too much with these high-tech projection system, and the thing Sati uses. It's slowly makes me question, that with this technological advancement why machines were strugling to make enough energy for themself, while humans are on the brink of bringing back old times. I guess it is to show, how working together is the good way, but again the movie lost the dark tone the previous ones nailed. For me, from what Niobe said -who despite being the leader or at least a decision maker in Io, changes her mind with every half line she speaks, and let herself manipulate by anyone- it's unclear that Zion is even exists anymore. Io is hiding from plain sight, unsure if they are hiding from the Machines, or from Zion, but both bring up questions.The Analyst is a mere joke of the cold and precise Architect. And the whole matrix is empty. Even The Merovingian is nothing less than a cameo. Feels like the machines gave the Analyst an empty sandbox and that's it. The previous ones had the Oracle, Vampires, Seraph...What i really missed, and killed the whole immersion, is the lack of real weight behind what is happening. Fights are empty, conversations are often lacks of true, deep toughts i loved in the first 3 movie. But one thing that felt really bad, is the first half of the movie, where it's like Lana is roasting the fans, making joke about the people speaking about the movie. Is it how she sees fans liking the toughts behind the movie, or bullet time and all? Or more like she got enough of fans analysing the movies and show them how stupid they are.It seems like Lana Wachowski made the 4th movie for herself, and for the crew just to relive the feeling. I enjoyed the movie as much, i hope she did not killed Matrix, as the universe still interresting, but that's it.",5
1568,"I was disappointed with all the negative reviews but after watching movie, don't get why people was so angry may be they're expecting some sort of Matrix 1 kinda movie. Although trilogy ended good but they were managed to create a good movie from the ashes of that. Let's see if they make a next movie or not because this time Neo won't be the only ONE, trinity seems to joining him. Surprising this movie has more suspense than the Original Triology combine.",8
1569,"I think the premise wasn't bad and could've passed even as a sole sequel to the original Matrix (without the unnecessary Reloaded and Revolutions), however, it was completely butchered by corporate script-writing. The after-credits scene is like a comedic self-reflection about how this movie was conceived. Unsubtle colour shading, the necessity to have characters only for the reason of selling toys later, poor one-liners, poor side character development etc. Etc. Everything that plagues other blockbuster productions is clearly present here too. Many scenes felt like they are recycled form other movies that aren't related to The Matrix. But the thing that was the most disappointing is CGI. It was very generic and underwhelming, there wasn't a single ""wow"" moment, and I wasn't even expecting that much.",5
1570,"Another attack on white men by the victimcrat, woke left and conservatives in general. Toxic masculinity has been fully replaced by a more toxic feminist movement. First thing you do to create a fascist state is to destroy its morals and family unit. This movie is just one more example of moral decay in our country.",1
1571,"Huge disappointment, as if they wanted to destroy the memory of the Matrix instead of continuing it ...I was waiting for return.... butIn the end it is much worse than I thought.Boring, shallow, confusing plot, full of meaningless philosophies.---- Agent Smith: Why, Mr. Anderson? Why; Why are you doing it? -the only way to recover is to watch the trilogy 1 2 3 again.",1
1572,"The Original Matrix movie was genius in the was it connected to an entire generation. This movie was based on the dream exploration that has been done in the decades before that. It describes a world where laws of Nature are different, certain things are possible but other thing on the other hand are very difficult and confronting. In that environment Characters were able to develope in a genuine way.The Two sequels were for me logical extensions of this movie. The added SCI-FI feel made it worthwhile.With the current movie the word resurrection lets me think of Drogo from GOT who came back in not his best self.I think the Director just didn't know where to go with this movie. The complex idea of what the Matrix represents is somehow gotten tainted or forgotten in the process. After that all ideas and props in the movie were not more than gimmicks like a sort of echo of the initial idea getting weaker as it proceeded. No amount of cleveredness, dialogues and funny crossreferences nor acting could prevent that.",1
1573,"Third part was already bad, there was no need for worse... Easy money plan to trick masses, there is very few good movies in last 5-10 years... Greed in capitalistic society destroyed movie industry.",1
1574,"I watched it at Russian premiere. And Gosh what expectations I had! I thought Matrix movies can't be bad, but Resurrection proved me wrong. So boring - I wanted to cry. I would write more, but I really have no strength. Only to cry maybe... Anyways seeing Neo and Trinity in the end together kissing and embracing on a big screen was overwhelming, but it's just one single shot. The rest is boring: even the action parts!!!! Not mentioning the dialogues. Sad, sad, very sad. I'm really sorry that after all these years going back to the Matrix didn't work at all.",1
1575,"Boy, oh boy, where do I start. First, I need to mention, that I only watched one trailer before I went to watch the movie in the cinema. I avoided all reviews and critics beforehand to enjoy the movie without any expectations.From the first minute, I had the feeling that I was watching a copy of a film that knew it was a copy. At every corner references to the first Matrix part, while in other films such references are made with a certain seriousness, Matrix 4 makes fun of Matrix 1. I really don't know what the director was thinking. Well, such little meta allusions and inside jokes would be great, if the rest is right.The figures here are only a shadow of their former selves. Morpheus is a joke, who jokes about the real Morpheus. He can't match Laurens Fishbourne's performance. And because he knows that, he jokes about it all the time. Either the Morpheus character is badly written or the actor can't handle the role. Mr Smith is also only a shadow of his predecessor. The old one was terrifying and tragic at the same time. The new one is neither. He is a lousy copy of the original. And what is Merovingian and his people doing in this part? They are pale and come across as mere laughingstocks. The analyst is well played, but his character somehow doesn't seem to me to conform to the rules of the Matrix universe. Hi, I'm the new architect, I'm better and yes I'm a new version blah blah blah, is cheaply done storytelling for me. There would have been a lot more in it to flesh out this new Matrix and its rules more profoundly.Besides these plot holes, I was particularly disturbed by the action scenes. They seemed much too rushed and cheaply shot. While in the first Matrix parts the action scenes are aesthetic and well choreographed, in this film they seem nervous, shaky, and incomplete. The camera is always too close to the action, but always doesn't stay on it long enough. One might think the actors couldn't fight properly. (Just like in certain action films where the actors are a bit older-I'm looking at you Taken) Especially the fight scenes seem uninspired, too shaky, and unfinished. For example, the fight scene on the train is too hectic and nervous, making you lose track of what's going on. Kingsman showed how a tough but beautiful fight scene can be shown in a small space.Keanu Reeves seems to be the only one here who tried to carry this film. But not even his acting could save a bad script and even worse action scenes. I have the feeling that Matrix 4 fundamentally does not take Matrix seriously and thus destroys the lovingly created Matrix world. This film was not worth the money I paid for the cinema entrance. Unfortunately, once again a film that only wanted to offer fanservice, but didn't want to add anything clever to the story. If you like Matrix, don't bother with Matrix 4.Fortunately, I had no expectations of the film. Nevertheless, my first thoughts after the credits were: What the hell was that?",4
1576,"The only great feature of the movie was Keanu Reeves. His performance is always superb and believable. However, the remaining cast, storyline, even the effects- not what I expected. The audience at the theatre was waiting for the movie to end. Disappointed for a theatre watch, should have waited for it to come out for streaming.",1
1577,I felt like I was watching a The Matrix rip-off film.Lacks the punch of the other films with a uninteresting and poorly executed story.New characters are bland &amp; boring.One of the worst sequels I've seen.,5
1578,Top 10 worse movies ever. Everybody left the theater asking to themselves: what the hell was this movie? Why did they do it to this great movie? Please don't dare to run another matrix. Let's keep the good memories from the trilogy in our minds and forget this abomination called resurrection.,1
1579,"Continually uses scenes from the first movie to bang you over the head with nostalgia which doesn't work but the movie was just not good. It's pacing is horrible, the script was poorly written, the action scenes were lazy and it feels more like the director and writer are dragging you into a therapy session of their issues and grievances. The original Matrix was great and I even dug the 2nd and 3rd but this one was absolute nonsense and just a bad movie all around.",1
1580,"Nothing to see here, do the laundry instead, take your dog out for a walk... Once the plot of the movie is revealed you just know its all going to be silly.",3
1581,"The first Matrix was such a defining moment in my young adulthood. When I heard that a 4th one is coming, and read what the professional movie critics had to say, I got all excited. My husband and I signed up for HBOMax, rewatched the entire series to get ready and set our alarm clocks to 3:00 am EST to see the movie.I only wish they did not cause so much hype and bring our hopes up....the let down was pretty gruesome.I knew it was going to be extremely difficult to top the first Matrix - it was a game changer in my ways. But, I hoped something spectacular nonetheless.This movie was not it.Unlike many, I did not appreciate the Bugs character and I dearly missed the old Morpheus and Smith. We had amazing actors in those roles before; charismatic and believable. This time we got cartoonish representations. The new ""architect"" guy, now called analyst, was difficult to take seriously. He seemed too comical for a Matrix movie - a total miscast (though I love the dude from HIMYM).Unlike the first movie, in this one, none of the side characters were memorable. I cannot even recall their names! In Matrix, we had Switch, Dozer, Tank, Cypher, Apoc and Mouse. In this one, who knows?One of the Wachowski sisters, who took the helm alone this time, turned Matrix into a parody; and I so wish she did not do that. There were so many other ideas she could have explored - the machine civil war angle was an intriguing one, for example.I also disagree with people who call this ""Meta."" This was not Meta at all - the fact that they referenced Warner Bros does not make them self-aware. And, self-awareness does not have to lead to parodies!One thing I liked was that they now elevated Trinity from the conventional supporting woman role to an even more key role. That was refreshing to see (no, it was not ""woke"" - please stop calling it that). We have movies with lead actors or lead actresses: why not have both and try lead couples. Maybe too cheesy: but it was different. Reminded me of House of Cards series a bit.Here is the main story (spoilers below):The Analysts realizes that Neo was ""the anomaly of anomalies,"" decides to resurrect him (essentially machines doing expensive medical work on him) and plugs him back into the Matrix. This is partly because, with so many people voluntarily leaving the Matrix, somehow the machines are having battery shortage. I am thinking why don't they just grow another crop of babies to make more battery?Anyways, for some reason, machines needed to create more energy; and Neo could be the solution, at least that is what the analyst thought. But then, Neo alone did not cut it; and the analyst also resurrects Trinity and plugs her back in. When both Neo and Trinity are in the matrix, and close to each other (but not too close to be actually happy), their ""misery"" leads them (and the entire matrix) to generate more energy. The key is that human body generates more heat/BTU when we are emotionally suffering. So, the analyst is going for that. There are probably other, more effective, ways to make humanity suffer than two lovebirds being apart; but they are the ""chosen couple,"" I guessIn this new version of Matrix, Neo is a game developer and is quite depressed. He also somehow can ""wake people up"" by looking at them. In the original Matrix, people were hackers, like Trinity and Neo, and were woken up because they noticed something was odd in the world around them through their coding experience. In this one, they are window cleaners, who took one good look at Neo.Anyways, Neo wakes Bugs up - totally unknowingly. Bugs then becomes a captain of a ship and starts looking for Neo; but he is hard to find because the analyst changed his digital image (so you don't see Neo when you look at him, but instead see an old man).Neo, the game developer, actually created the first three movies as video games, it turns out. Hence, any residual memories he may have are attributed to his past experiences of developing those games. The analyst, the bad guy in this movie, is Neo's therapist. Neo is working on a new game, called Binary; but, he is behind schedule and over budget. In his downtime, Neo is secretly messing with the old matrix code and, at some point, he creates a mini digital character, like new digital Morpheus, in Smith's role (""your men are already dead, Lieutenant"" scene). Somehow, Bugs gets in there (and I have no clue how) and gets the new digital Morpheus out to the real world - where he becomes a 3D swarm drone representation (looks super silly). In this process, they go into Neo's old one-bedroom studio etc., and I am clueless in regards to what is going on and who is who! Morpheus is Smith, this new Bugs character is Morpheus - a complete mess.It turns out there is another Smith; Neo's business partner in the video game world. He is kinda bad but in a very mooted way. I had no idea what his purpose was. At some point, this other Smith brings some of the other exiled programs back, including the Merovingian, now a homeless fella, whose cameo seems to have been intended to be thought provoking in regards to how everything, the books, the art etc became worse since the previous Matrix version. Exiles fight the new red pills and loose. Merovingian runs away (I actually was rooting for him to win at this point).There are some super underwhelming fight scenes. Smith is involved. Again, motivations are unclear. The movie continues to go downhill.The Sati character returns as an adult somehow, and wants to help rescue Trinity. Why? We don't have a good reason. She does not like the Analyst guy, I guess.Trinity is ready to be saved but it has to be her choice, of course. After a bit drama with digital kids involved (playing the mother card, how cheap), Trinity (called Tiffany) ditches her family and kids, and chooses Neo.By the way, nobody (except maybe Niobe) seems to care about the possibility of starting a new war with machines. They go unplug Trinity; just like that!Trinity is saved but the Analyst starts an overwrite or something - then the movie turns into a good old fashioned Zombie attack. Oh, I forgot to mention, the new matrix also has sleeping bots in it (who have green code looking eyes, that is how we know who they are). Why do they have bots? I, once again, have no clue. I would imagine they take space away from real heat-generating battery people; maybe that is why they are having energy shortage! I think I am reading too much into the script at this point and trying to make sense of something that does not have any. Anyways, the sleeping bots are woken up by the analyst, they turn into bombs and jump from buildings trying to hit Neo and Trinity. Zombie apocalypse galore!Neo and Trinity escape and start flying.It turns out Neo cannot fly but Trinity, somehow, can. Oh, they also don't use phone lines anymore, they go through mirrors. De ja vu is still a big deal; and there is, once again, a black cat.The analyst guy seems quite vulnerable - as Trinity beats him up (which was so strange, because we have never seen Trinity attack a defenseless person before.) Anyways, the analysts says ""ouchie"" (literally). And, the movie ends.Here, you have it.",
1582,"It wasn't unwatchable, but only barely.They had a few new ideas, like people living together with machines. I liked the way the programs could be embodied in real life by nanobots. But it doesn't make a good movie.The plot was horrible. The style, the lines, the bright colors all together made the movie feel like it was its own parody. They even referred to the WB studio, and how Matrix 4 is for the new generations.Bringing Neo, Trinity and even Agent Smith back to life ? It made the original trilogy just meaningless. Even Neo said in the movie, that everything was for nothing. And then they said ""no, not for nothing"", and then we can see what humans achieved by Neo's sacrifice: they basically had cute maching-pets now: A flying dolphin-thing and a small robot cockroach or whatever. Also they had a hobby garden.Yes! Those are the things worth sacrifying our lives for!!! But anyways, there are still billions of people in the matrix, in their incubators, breed like corps to harvest, . People who woke up still live like cavemen after decades. The sky is still dark but slightly brighter. Hurray!It was Matrix 1999 all over again exept it was way simplier. It was about waking up Neo and then Trinity. That's it. There are no chosen one, or trying to stop the matrix.Agent Smith was back what did he want? He wanted to kill Neo at begining, but at the end he helped him and Trinity? Why? Who cares?Why was Smith able to beat Neil P. Harris who was basically the new God in the matrix? Who cares?Why was Trinity OP at the end and not Neo? Why could they both fly? Are they both the choosen one? Everyone can fly now? Who cares?",4

1584,"Tl;dr: A thirsty love letter to the original gets confused in its own goal and ends up as a run of the mill Christmas love story that makes love actually look like lord of the rings. Disclaimer: not actually a Christmas movie.Oh boy, we have another one. The comparisons to the new star wars trilogy are just too easy to make. The pitchfor this movie was only comprised of the revenue numbers from the original films. I will be reviewing this as a part of the matrix movie series, as the film plays so heavily into the existing works (flashbacks of original footage and all) that it can not be seen as an independent continuation.The plot:The movie starts off alright, there is a refreshing twist on rebooting a franchise that sort of breaks the fourth wall. Ima tell you right now, this is worth the 3 points I gave this movie, nothing else contributes. It's not ground breaking, but at least they dont try to swipe the original works under the rug and made an actual attempt at a meaningful connection. This is short lived though, as about 10 minutes later this story line has run out and the movie resorts to an extended sequence about how cool the original matrix was, with flashbacks to boot. What first seemed like an original yet quirky take on the original work very rapidly descends into an idolization of the previous films that goes on and on and on. Its the definition of tooting ones own horn.We're now about 20 minutes in, and this movie is 2.5 hours. You're in for a ride. The movie starts sketching a new world in which all of the same personalities exist as you see in the original, but most are now embodied in different people that are vaguely related to characters from the original series. Or at least they heard about them once and now they talk about that time that they heard about the old characters because yay nostalgia. Slowly but steadily we get introduced to more and more original characters, sometimes played by completely different actors.(because some program in the matrix just gave them new faces. Okay? Cool),They are now 60 years along in their life, we barely get any explanation of how these characters developed over this vast time period. But hey, at least they recognize each other at first sight! Not that it matters though. Woven through these introductions and expositions is a critique on the divisiveness of modern society. Unfortunately its sown together about as good as the characters in the human centipede as the characters go back on or completely contradict their original character arcs. Some characters disappear as fast as they arrived, some not having more than 5 lines even though they were a major part of previous movies. To someone that knows the original trilogy, these are weird encounters. To someone that has not seen the previous movies: You will have been sat in confusion for about 2 hours by now and nothing makes sense. The majority of this movie is setting an unnecessarily convoluted stage just to seem like it has substance, and then we go into the final act.The last two hours turn out to not have meant a lot at all. Boy loves girl and is nothing without her. Ooga boogaa. Twilight was a better love story. Oh by the way this girl was dead but miraculously isnt.The action:One of the staples of the Matrix used to be the action scenes. The world that was set in the original works allows for over the top, immersive action that defied reality and set a precedent of what was possible in a movie, despite the technologic limitations in those days.This movie: Not so much. The action is visibly unrehearsed. I've been trying to hold back on star wars comparisons, but here is one: The action in this movie makes the Snoke fight from The Last Jedi look like Old Boy. The amount of time people are just swinging or shooting at nothing or waiting a full second for someone to start their choreo are astounding. On top of that, the editing is so bad that nearly every punch, kick, dodge or block gets robbed of its momentum and impact. Shoddy wire work is applied to mimic some of the more iconic moves of the original films, but done in such a bad way that it looks weak, slow and fake. Most episodes of the A-Team had better moves. This is not a joke, the action scenes look straight from a B level, low budget tv series. All characters that had an existing place in the power rankings of the matrix now have zero control over what they do, with inexplicable bursts of power sometimes saving their asses and disappearing as soon as they came. The action in this movie makes every known character look like a low budget parody of their original selves. Which brings me nicely to my next topic:The CG:This movie has some good graphics, dont get me wrong, but the budget is applied in the wrong places. Honestly, it feels like 90% went into creating io (the new zion) and the machine world. During the horn tooting at the start of the movie a precedent is set: We have to find the new bullet time. Unfortunately nothing is even attempted in the action scenes. The film focusses only on re-hashing familiar special effects to make sure the movie does not feel too far away from the original. Unfortunately, someone forgot to allow for any creative freedom, which results in effects straight from 1999. Nothing is really improved, nothing has a new artistic interpretation, nothing is really any different from what it was. This ethos leaks into new effects as well, with the final encounter looking straight out of the lawnmower man. Even though we now have the technology to create amazing environments and effects on tight budgets, this movie manages to be a regression from the original 22 year old film.I've put more effort in this review than its worth. Just dont pay money to see it.",3
1585,"I started watching The matrix because of the last premiere's hype. I was just curious to see what it's like to continue the story that began more than 20 years ago. The first movie got me 8/10 then came the second movie which was 50/50 then the third movie was a bit trash like 6/10. But now here comes the last movie which is so miserable, irrelevant and inexplicable. How the fu.. can someone be rebuilt and revived if he's a human? Why the f would faces change. How can Morpheus be Morpheus if he doesn't know who he is? BTW, all matrix movies till the last were filmed in cold graphics. They tried to make everything so nostalgic but warm colors killed the vibe. Plus, I should mention that seeing how badly actors have aged since the previous movie makes me so sad. Overall, I pity my more-than-9 hour-time wasted on this cringe but I would've pitied more if I added it to my watchlist.",5
1586,"Let's face it. Geriatrics are not really the best ingredients in a fiction action movie like the Matrix...The story is boring and very stupid actually. This is not even Sci-Fi... It is just Fiction. Poor script for someone hoping to cash on a trilogy name with a quadrilogy. Nah. That did not work for me.Hard to believe that the last Matrix was in 2003. 19 years later they expect oldies to move and look like teenagers again! No way.But these two actors are still in my fav list and I was happy to see something with both of them together again. I would have liked a movie more appropriate, still Fiction possible, more spiritual and genuine. Instead of another hollywood 99% CGI constructed.",3
1587,This movie seems like a Chinese knock off the original Matrix and it makes one think if the writer/director actually was even involved in the first Matrix movie..It's a TV movie at best if you have some time to waste.. go for it but don't bring the pop corn out..,2
1588,Love the P. C. garbage. Terrible way to end a great saga. Mostly about how Neo never mattered. It was all trinity. Because all films have to be feminist. Inject sexual orientation now. Verse just putting out a good film. They ruined everything about it. Down to the action. It was a big deal. To be realistic with a sci fi mix. Yet in this one. Its just slomo effect galore. Was about 5 in the first 1 minute.... Just awful. Really love Keanu but. Wish he wouldnt of wasted his time. On something so beneath his abilities. Rather of seen another John wick. Thats like the first. Not ruined by branding and hollywood. Like last 3..... Matrix WAS perfect as is. Now this will be the memory.....,3
1589,"But it surprised me that this isn't that. If you get stuck on the nostalgia immediately and write this movie off just like any modern rehash-movie i think you're doing yourself a misservice.Sure, the action is not great and too messy.The acting is for the most part not great either.But there's something, or alot of things different in this movie. More information, more open to interpretation than perhaps even the original Matrix. I'm not comparing, just saying that this is different and it leaves me wanting to understand more. Plus it flips a finger not only to like... everything but also to itself which i feel is kinda fresh! If you don't get that, well i guess you'll have to grow older ;)",8
1590,"What can I say about this? We all knew that a third sequel to the Matrix couldn't work. It literally makes no sense since all of the plot threads were closed in Revolutions, and there was absolutely no room for a sequel. So now this happens and... let me spare you some time, ok? This is nothing but Warner desperately trying to hold on to some nostalgia to cash in, and it's so unapologetically meta that you can see they themselves are trying to cope with the guilt. In a childish manner I would say.To be fair, the first 40 minutes could lead into something decent, I mean not great because the superb action and the acting were almost absent in this leftover of a sequel, but it COULD be something at least passable and refreshing. Why? Because Lana plays with the line that separates fiction from reality, and that is presented by the point of view of a tortured, suffering Neo, something we have never seen before. After that, is just a redoing of the first Matrix but with 0 sense. Nothing to add on that, because is just that. Shot by shot. You got Zion (well, it's called Io this time), Neo waking up from the Matrix, all that. It's an embarrassment of a ""sequel"" and something the creators should apologize for, honestly. I mean, how lazy do you have to be in order to give up your script in the first 40 minutes and running into copying the first Matrix afterwards? It's something that resonantes with literally noone, and that's why this is being hated so much: because everybody already saw the first Matrix movie in the first place!! And you know the funny thing is? The creators of this abomination know this, and proceeded to make this movie nonetheless.I should give this one a 1/10, because this is worthless, and gives you nothing, nor even entertainment, but I think i can give the movie a little credit for at least trying in the beginning. PS: discount Agent Smith is the worst casting you could ever hope for.",2
1591,"The original trilogy set the bar in a lot of ways for its fight choreography and special effects. This effort sets the bar back immensely! Special effects bad, fights scenes slow and unimaginative, overall just not entertaining. Wanted it just to end after a while.Some just didn't want to have another Matrix movie made, however I was looking forward to this but again just left a bad taste in my mouth. It looked like a low budget knockoff at times.",5
1592,"There are many problems with this movie.Some of the biggest is adding the unserious ""funny"" tone, showing actualy scenes from Matrix 1, making Neo a simp.",3
1593,"I am a fan of these series and I really tried to get the message this movie tried to communicate. It was awful in every aspect - action scenes, plot, dialogues, etc. Keanu on the other hand was awesome :)",3
1594,"I am a huge fan of The Matrix franchise, and this movie just released today in India. My friends and I were deciding whether to watch Spider-Man: No Way Home or this. One of us is a big Spider-Man hater and so we decided we will watch this movie, and we will watch Spider-Man: No Way Home some other time. Initially I was very sceptical about this movie since I didn't exactly like Revolutions, but The Matrix: Awakens had given me hope that this is going to be some really good stuff.In my opinion, this movie is going to be very divisive, as in the case of Black Widow or Man of Steel. Either you will really love it or absolutely hate it. It has some really good cinematography and action scenes. Unlike the previous trilogy which has too much green colour, this one is actually quite colourful. On the downside, however, it has nostalgia pandering, circlejerking (there's literally a five minute scene in which people are praising The Matrix Trilogy and saying how much Warner Bros liked it), quirky references to gaming, too much exposition, unnecessary flashbacks and overall the movie starts feeling very much dragged in the first half itself. I almost dozed off at the part where Priyanka Chopra comes as the adult Sati.While the first half was pretty Meh, the second half was pretty dope, especially after Agent Smith and Agent Johnson come. So what happens over here is that Neo has been taking blue pills prescribed to him by his psychiatrist, which make him forget what The Matrix was. Instead he vaguely remembers them in the form of memories, from which he has created a video game franchise based on it. In this movie The Matrix trilogy is a game series, and Thomas Anderson is a game designer. Now Morpheus has to convince Neo to take the Red Pill and join The Matrix again. I can't speak more than this without giving spoilers, so I will just recommend you to sit till the end, after the roll credits there is a post credit scene that you definitely wouldn't want to miss out.The movie does have a lot of references to the previous movies, but you don't need to rewatch them as long as you remember the basics, since most of the time the important scenes are just shown in the flashbacks. That even includes the iconic scene where Neo bends backward to dodge Agent Smith's bullets. Speaking of Agent Smith, however, he isn't exactly great in this movie. Most of it is carried by Agent Johnson instead. Neo was, once again, my favourite character in this movie. He actually feels like someone who is coming back after a long time to take what belongs to him. Ever since Keanu Reeves has grown his beard, he has been giving that kind of a look.So overall I'd say while The Matrix: Resurrections has a better CGI and action scenes and is even funny at some points, it lacks the cohesive story or any ground-breaking visual that the first movie had. And that is saying something since it came out after 18 years so something new was expected. That, however, should not be seen as something completely negative since it is not supposed to be a reboot, but just a normal sequel. If I were to rank the four movies, I'd say The Matrix &gt; Reloaded &gt; Resurrections &gt; Revolutions. So yeah, if you liked Reloaded and Revolutions, you will like this too.",7
1595,"I was there in the cinemas when The Matrix broke, saw it like 3 times in the 90s. I watched the upcoming titles slowly degrading but still had a somehow nice atmosphere.And here we are in 2021. Visuals are over the top, that is why the 5 stars, still enjoyable to some extent, but the story is paper thin, full of cringy agendas which should never have gone into this movie. The film lacks a coherent story, it has scenes from the older movies, unnecessarily, and sorry tovsay but a total letdown for my generation who grew up with it. Almost a waste of time.",5
1596,After seeing some pretty bad reviews for your film I feared the worst so it came as a great surprise that I really enjoyed it. I found it kept in the vein of the originals and picked up the story well. The were some good nods to the original as well.Incidentally my brother had not seen the original films and he really enjoyed it and thought they explained it well.Maybe it helped to have my expectations lowered?,7
1597,"The sad fact is that The Matrix was a good idea made into a pretty good movie with some big plot holes. Every sequel that followed, including this one are just cash grabs that badly tweak the original screenplay in ways that leave even larger plot holes.The first two sequels were fairly incoherent and repetitive, but this last one made my head hurt. If I have to decipher the motivations and purposes for why two computer programs are fighting each other in the simulation, why the most advanced, and exceedingly lethal, robots have decided to join the humans seeking to disrupt the robots only remaining source of energy, and why it was beneficial for the robots to rebirth Neo and Trinity in the first place, and especially as an ordinary housewife and, incredulously, as the actual creator of the original Matrix series, which was just a game all along, then I have to accept that the writers have no answers either.BTW, the last of the trilogy revealed that Neo in the Zion world was the real simulation with powers to shut down the robots with his mind in that simulation. So why would the citizens of the Zion simulation bother trying to convince the human batteries in the matrix to reject that simulation and wake up in Zion, which is just another simulation, rather than just destroying the battery towers in the Zion simulation. After all, none of the human batteries in the matrix and none of the people in Zion are really people anyway, are they?I gave two of the three stars because there are a few scenes with emotion and good acting. All the actions scenes might just have been deleted scenes from the first sequel.",3
1598,"What a total disaster.. all it makes you ask - WHO is responsible for making this movie? Clearly it's not one person but a group effort?To someone who rewatched the 1st instalment probably over a 100 times, this feels worse than a final year project a group of students have put together.The story is lacking, probably it's even a wrong story to have - it feels like it's more of an excuse for a story/film to be made, rather than an actual story.Post processing effects which the original Matrix is known for - not there, cast - really poor choices for the roles..This could and should've been an amazing film, but absolutely everything in it just feels wrong, cheaply made/produced and or made in a rush.Matrix 4 doesn't have any of that finer detail, the precision and uniqueness of every actor, their movement, environment, scene sequence etc. The original movie had. Scenes are not well thought through and just make you feel like you are watching an early 90s action movie - where it's hard to figure out who's shooting at who and in which direction.It would've been great to have more of the original cast in the movie and definitely have a different story than this fourth movie has, which would've given the original cast a valid reason to be part of this movie.Please don't make any more. Maybe erase this one from archives and remake it again.",1
1599,... on YOU.Courtesy of Larry and Andy.Don't believe me? Go watch it then...I guess $12 Million was enough to convince Keanu to be part of this... even if he does give most of it away.,1
1600,"First of all the movie is garbage, storyline is boring and the dialogue is flat.On top of that all, the endless references to the previous movies nice at the beginning, but starts to be annoying very quickly.And the cherry is of course the #MeToo nerative that was incorporated into the script.Such a shame, a waist of 2.5 hours.",1
1601,"Felt like I was watching a documentary with some glimpses back into the Matrix trilogy.Even the effects from the first Matrix movie were much cooler, they felt much better executed. The dialogue/script was so boring in this movie I was falling asleep. A BBC Earth documentary is much more entertaining than this.Yeah. I am disappointed.",3
1602,So much excitement for this movie and in the end it feels like a re-hash of the first in many ways ... except in sheer groundbreaking impact.Really nothing new and overall a mediocre and somewhat confusing disappointment.,4
1603,"The entire movie was like i'm watching a Disney! Fist bumps with the machines, hipster creator of the matrix with random jokes, Pokémon lookalike machines, mad max gramma ,boring soundtrack, random unnecessary characters that had too much screen time, and repeated scenes from the first movie with slightly different effects. Pure garbage.",1
1604,"What's the purpose of a movie? To entertain you and maybe extend your mental horizons. In my opinion Lana succeeded in doing that. The revival was funny, nostalgic but with a fresh breeze and a smart twist at the end. It opened the doors to a new generation of viewers to discover the Matrix and ask themselves the important questions about their own perceived realities.Don't bother about the bad reviews. They took the blue pill ;-)",10
1605,"So, having seen the first 3 &amp; finding the story super hard to understand in each of them but still enjoying the action all the same, I went to give this one a watch tonight!The film sees Neo after nearly 20 years, living what seems to be a normal life, but it is then he is thrown back into the Matrix world to save Trinity.Not exactly sure what the story is, but that's roughly it. The fact that I can't even describe the story goes to show how incoherent this film is alone, never mind the previous 3 films which, the first I could just about describe but even then that's a push in itself.I found the film to be alright, it's not amazing, but if the previous 3 films are anything to go by, this one was bearable. The film, like the previous 3 in the franchise, still suffers from the same lengthy, dragged out, incoherent story telling. At 2 hours &amp; 17 minutes it was long &amp; did seem to go on forever.The characters were good as with the action, effects &amp; bits of eye candy we got, aside from that, the film wasn't the greatest, but bearable &amp; a little easier to understand unlike the previous 3 films. But still, for a good amount of time, I did feel like the film was talking in its own language as I did find it hard to understand what was what, I did start to understand near the end just about but even then I still wasn't sure if I got it or not...Overall, it's an alright film, but don't expect much. It's confusing as you'd expect, but it's got some great action scenes, eye candy &amp; visuals. 5/10.",5
1606,This is a total destruction of the matrix mechandize. An unnecessary recreation with ultimately the same plot. Lacks a lot of things from the previous story and also lacks any improvement. I still wonder why they released it though.,4
1607,"This movie is really really bad, I made it an hour and than I threw in the towel. The Madea character that Jada Pinkett played did it for me, avoid this movie it is a serious waste of time.",1
1608,"Most people opinion is that this movie is just a cash grab, not interesting, too much for nothing and that The Matrix should have stayed a trilogy. I disagree.In my opinion, the Matrix should have stopped after the first movie. It was a perfect movie, a perfect balance between philosophical insight, storytelling, good visual, good acting and a perfect open-ended finale. All boxes in the book were ticked and it was perfect.Everything after that is a slow slope down and those movies are so easy to put in order:Matrix 1 &gt; Matrix 2 &gt; Matrix 3 &gt; Matrix 4.Plus, I hate this garbage era were critics, journalists and so forth are just playing the stupid zeitgeist game without a once of intellectual seriousness. Most people are like : Matrix 4, meh, such a deception... Critics are like: Matrix 4... it's made by a trans person, so it is indeed personal, moving, astonishing, unique and all around very good, the perfect reboot.I hate this era, it's garbage.",5
1609,"And when we thought 2021 couldn't be worse than this Matrix recyclation happened. Oh what a movie! Bad writing, bad acting, bad vfx, a complete insult to the Matrix (1999).",1
1610,"They sell garbage packed into a very nice box. They have stole 2 hours from my life. This is fraud. This movie is a total nonsense. In my opinion, if is the new cinematography way then it will be end soon.",2
1611,"This was nothing short of an excuse for a movie to cash in off of the success of the previous three. In all fairness I don't know if my review would be so negative had I not seen the first three. I can assure you that this movie put a nail in the coffin for the matrix series.They will not be able to recover from this and produce a matrix five. On a positive note, aside from the relatively weak storyline a mediocre at best special effects, you can't deny strong performances from Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss. They were as always brilliant.",4
1612,"I don't write reviews often. I'm writing this because Lana has clearly abandoned the people that loved her and her sisters creation and made a big middle finger for everyone to watch.This movie doesn't even have a shade of its former self. The old Matrix movies had thought provoking themes, complex lore about humans and machines, the fight sequences had kung fu dances like the actors were silk, and not to mention ground breaking visual effects. This movie does not have any of that. Instead we get a film that is confusingly broken. They stripped everything and decided to reinvent the wheel by making it a triangle shape. What idiocy. What a big middle finger.I'm angry. I wish I could take a spoon and scoop this movie out of my head. I'm insulted. And believe me, I have every reason to. I was a big fan. I watched the movies, even the animatrix. I played the video games. This was my Star Wars. My lord of the rings. I consumed its lore and tried to fathom its complexities. For years I was hungry for more of it and Lana served me a dish of steaming pile of garbage. I wish it stayed dead and never gotten its resurrection.",3
1613,"Can't believe just how good this turned out to be after such a long wait.Brilliantly done on every level and it holds together well on its own as well as in context with its predecessors.I love good sci-fi and it doesn't get much better than this. Sumptuous. And I must add that it's a love story well told, which is never a had thing.",10
1614,"They should either reboot the franchise or leave it be as a trilogy, which, by definition, it is something that has three installments. This movie's best parts are the references to the old ones.Neo looks not only lost, but kind of idiotic. Trinity became a supergirl out of nowhere and the new nemesis is a watered down version of the Architect from Reloaded.Old characters appear just to fill in the nonsensical story; the lack of charisma from the new Smith and Morpheus is hard to endure. Merovingian's ridiculous small and irrelevant part looks like something out of Mel Gibson's Mad Max. Niobe is now the president/general/protector of a new city which rivals or survived a war with Zion, or took its place (not clear and, at that point it the movie, you couldn't even care).The ""bots"" added to create the ""swarm"" tries to imitate Smith's spread from Revolutions.As a fan of the previous movies, I was hoping for something that could instigate at least the desire to see other sequels, but this film falls short in every possible way. Not even the combat moves or special effects are visual compelling. More of the same, with none of its original flavour.One can only wonder what is going to happen with John Wick 4 after this atrocious sequel. Let's hope Keanu doesn't follow Nicholas Cage's footsteps (Bill and Ted 3 and Replica are a dangerous foreshadowing)",1
1615,"There is a scene. In this film that mirrors one of the greatest tragedies that ever bevel The United States ...this year marked the 20th year observance of 9/11.... The scene I speak of was one of the most horrific things ever witnessed....Some of us never forgot that we lost some of our fellow Americans having no choice but to jump.... or burn, or suffocate from the fire.I'm sorry. This was a great effort, but there were a couple things the movie should not have depicted.",4
1616,"Loved it. I really liked also seeing some actors from sense 8, which was an awesome show. Going back to the core concept of freeing your mind was, for me, timely and inspiring. Sad to see the low rating and negative reviews for this awesome addition to the franchise. Two thumbs up!",10
1617,"I just had to post a review. As many, I'm a huge fan of the first one, then it's downhill from there (although I did really like the second and felt the third one was reasonably ok). What to expect now, 20 years later? My expectations were skyscraper high, then after the first reviews popped up, I realized it was going to be bad. Honestly, you can tell by the first 5 or so minutes. It is just messy. Some of the visuals are improved, but that is as much positivism as one can sum up for the movie. All else is... wrong. Does not fit into the same world we once knew for the trilogy. Some of the ""funny"" scenes are downright bad. I would feel embarrassed to approve them in the Final Cut. Overall, had this not been in any way linked to the previous movies, one might even spend a rainy afternoon watching it and get something in return... maybe. With such a history behind it, man oh man is this disappointing. There is not a single memorable line or sequence. Nothing. Even the fighting is lame. And the many, many references from the past movies make no sense... those are all imprinted in our memory, no need to go back so explicitly. Just like Terminator was finished on the second one, the Matrix was done somewhere in the early 2000s. Go see it if you have to, just lower your expectations as much as possible and try to watch it until the end.",2

1620,This is by far the weakest movie in the series. It's a great cast but the writing and acting are truly average. So I guess it comes down to the director. Sorry but very very average and not convincing. It's really looks like a product of a corrupt and infantile Hollywood making movies for 11 year olds. Very disappointed.,2
1621,I guess the main reason why I didn't really liked it was the fact that Neo and &lt;Trinity were played by original cast but Morpheus and Smith wasn't. You can try to explain this throughout the movie but then the story became chaos.,4

A bunch of self-referential garbage and flirting with the fourth-wall just came off as cheesy and self-serving. There were no compelling characters or plot. The story feels like was being written while it was being filmed.And for a franchise that prides itself on visual effects, Niobe looked like Jada Pinkett Smith wearing a mask of quality similar to Johnny Knoxville in ""Bad Grandpa"".I don't understand ANY review over a 4 0r 5 ... and even those must be purely for nostalgia reasons. Anyone giving it a 10 is either paid by Sony or an absolute ... I don't know. I can't even conceive of someone who would like this. It is just NOT good. In any way.I was tempted to give a lower review just to balance out the unjustified 10s. But ... this is my honest rating. I have legit not seen a movie this bad in the past 5 years (easily).Just GARBAGE!",2
1626,"I can't recall watching a movie that made me roll my eyes every few seconds. I think the last time that happened was Matrix 2 and 3.I am fully convinced that Matrix 1 was an anomaly, like Neo is in the Matrix. As if the brothers/sisters used all their creative and director energy at once, similar to assigning all skill points of an RPG-character to one skill.Yet again I have to endure this Jupiter Ascending type of nonsense where the viewer is introduced with weak-ass, hollow mythology every few minutes, told only to the viewer to defend what's going to happen the next 15 minutes.The action scenes, set design, and fight choreography is boring. The actors, except Bugs and the Analyst, are not convincing or directed properly. Agent Smith isn't even 5% of the original. Such a generic character.No one gets screen-time for us to care about them. They remain one-dimensional and at some point become annoying.This 4th installment is specifically terrible because it satirizes the problems with extending/repeating a completed story (the original trilogy), and it uses constant flashbacks which forces me to compare this movie with the original film all the time. Comparisons, because of this, are unavoidable and unfavorable.When Trinity escapes from cops and agents, it feels clunky and ""off."" causing me once again to compare the new with the old, similarly to the Morpheus exchange in the bathroom (satire again). Many more of these similar situations pull me out of the story due to the comparison.As Screenrant said: ""The Matrix Resurrections is at war with itself, wanting to be both something new and more of the same all at once"".",1
1627,"Keanu Reeves is like America's Jackie Chan: both are decent actors, who possess incredible talent and athletic skill that surpasses nearly all great actors and stuntmen in their field; they can do it ALL.And films like, The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded. John Wick, The Legend of the Drunken Master, Who Am I?, etc. Present the best of the best of these actors. But due to a floppy plot, predictable dialogue and minimal character development, The Matrix 4 does not deliver.Why couldn't writers and directors just keep their confidence in the interesting material they had already written? Why did they have to divulge into fiction that is so fiction that it makes absolutely no sense?The Matrix 4 is a disappointment.",5
1628,Look no further for the personal machinations and political views from one half of the duo that brought you The Matrix!The first 45 minutes of the film allow Wachowski to spin a yarn on how they feel about the Matrix franchise. The movie's later attempt to give the viewer what's happened since Revolutions is a slew of disjointed writing and unfinished narrative.Suspension of disbelief is hard to form with the lack of subtlety and derivative universe.,2

1630,"""Nothing Comforts Anxiety Like A Little Nostalgia""What is the matter with people? For a second time, I don't get all this hate. I may as well belong in the minority this time, but I have to admit, I very much appreciated this attempt. At first, part of me was worried; mainly due to an abundance of negative reactions from the audience. I honestly thought I'm in for a huge setback. Little did I know, I was about to get a rather pleasant surprise.This is exactly why people shouldn't rely too much upon the reviewers and their 'subjective' conclusions. You need to see it with your own eyes and make your own judgments! For someone like me, who had just finished watching the Original Trilogy, this comes as a godsend. A reboot that is adequately devoted to the source material as well as respected the world they had formerly created.They sure tried to bring up a modern Narrative, a contemporized iteration you might say, yet the good old flavour continues to prevail. The script do get a little complicated and had some difficulties with the newer expansions but then again it managed to stay true to the classics. It might not have the same charisma as compared to the first; however, it's still more or less to the level of the last two films, if not better!If you ask me, everything will come down to one aspect in particular. It will depend heavily upon someone's perception about Neo and Trinity or specifically the relationship they share. If you consider yourself to be one among those who have always cared about these two individuals and their affection, then Matrix Resurrection will definitely put a smile on your face. Even though the others may not relate in the same way as we do.",8
1631,Pretty obvious they weren't even trying. Story concepts brought up and dropped. A script that went ... somewhere? A weak story line of Neo &amp; Trinity. And some of the hands down worst acting you've ever seen from Reeves who deserved a way better script.,1
1632,"Honestly worst film of 2021, also biggest disappointment. It was almost a parody of original matrix series. I can't say anything positive about it. It tried to be cool but it failed miserably.",2
1633,The only good one was the first. Couldn't wait to finish this piece of garbage. Bored senseless even with the great special effects. Hopefully this will be the last. Would have been nice to see more of the original cast as well.,2
1634,"Wow! What a mess. I mean what the hell is this? I can watch any original matrix movies and still get entertained. I was expecting it to be bad but not this bad. Well, here it is.Story: Too woke. Lacks fiction and sense. 1/10Plot: Too too far fetched and pointless. 1/10Special effects: Worst than the original Matrix. 0/10Acting: Too tired, soul less, uninterested.Overall rating: Pathetic attempt to cash one last paycheck by mooching of the success of the original trilogy while spreading the woke ness.",1
1635,"Without any new visual effects or breakthrough plot, the new Matrix relies too heavily on past events and nostalgia. It's great to see Neo and Trinity back, but all the other bit-acting tries to piecemeal a plot line that isn't clear or engaging.",6
1636,"Was expecting this movie to be the epic continuation, the reset of the Matrix, even the possibility to matrix 5Instead i got 2 and a half hours of pink pill, poor effect execution, a bad story overall. It seems to be a parody to the matrix, not a continuation.Trinity and Neo, are 100% perfect combination though. But everything else, ruined.",2
1637,What is wrong with you pplWhy mess something which ended so BRILLIANTLYYou ruined the whole experience of the 1st three parts also.Total garbage.,1
1638,"Jam-packed with Hongkong fight sequences, this is more of a 'based on' than a sequel. If anything, it answers questions with more questions.The Matrix franchise stood out not just for the ideas and twists but for its raw grittiness. This instalment feels sanitised to a Freeguy level. Smith and the Analyst look equally at home on the set of Frazier.When all is 'revealed', the aims of the Analyst in keeping our lovers apart defies logic even in fiction. Besides, if the Matrix recreated them, why not just create more?Worthy mention.Henwick.Weirdness.Zombie-horde-like scenes.Smith more powerful than Neo but prefers him alive and well.Cops and SWAT from the same marksman school as Storm Troopers.Trinity can fly but not Neo.It'll probably all be explained in the next instalment.WHOA!",1
1639,"Honestly I think a lot is missing from the feel of the original matrix films with this one. The action scenes feel slow. There's no suspense because it doesn't feel like there's any pressure to get things done before the machines try to stop their plan. The whole return to zion feels pointless. There's just nothing here philosophically.I feel like the most intriguing think they probably could have done with this film was to focus on an alliance between man and the machines. There's some philosophical questions they could have asked there about what makes humans real and what could make a machine real. In this movie it feels like they focused on the love between Neo and Trinity, but we already got that in the original trilogy so it doesn't add anything here.There's a great story in the Animatrix movie where a group of humans try to show a machine what it means to be human. For me that's where this story should have gone, especially after they mentioned a civil war between the machines and humans. This movie is just a shameful cash grab. None of the cameos from the original movies meant anything here. None of the new characters were impressive in any manner. IMO this movie isn't cannon.",5
1640,"I'm not shocked by the bad reviews on here. Transcendental stories rarely appeal to the masses, the sheeple. My advice is, watch the film and judge for yourself. Keeping in mind this a sequel to a series that began in 1999. The world has changed greatly since. Lana volunteered to direct this film because WB was going to go through with the project with or without her. And she took the opportunity to not sell out, and told a story that could only make sense if you're actually paying attention to the dialogue. So on that note, I do recommend watching it at home, so you can rewind and replay some scenes, maybe with close captions on. Or give it a second watch. My friend who saw it at the theater, was left feeling a little confused because some of the dialogue goes a bit too fast to grasp the whole message in one sitting. So they had to give it a second watch.I must end my review for now with a pretty solid observation by Derek Robertson I came across about this film today: ""The new one is a sophisticated self-critique of the culture that swallowed it"" -- as in the first film's message.",10
1641,"I have watched the first movie when it released.I was in high school back then.It was great.It was more than just a movie.I bought the books, the dvds, watched and read it over and over again.The only thing i didn't like in this movie is the character who played by Neil Patrick Harris.He turned that character into a joke.I think if you are a genuine matrix fan you will not dislike this movie.I loved it.Watched it 2 times.",10
1642,"I really enjoyed this movie. Maybe we all expect something that blow out our minds, but in the end, we get a lot of fun, references and a good script.The only thing I really missed is the original Morfeo and Smith actors. The new one are pretty ""meh"".And yes, for me, this was far better than revolutions.",8
1643,"The storyline is boring and there is way too much forced nostalgia from the first. They probably imitated every iconic moment from the first movie but it was clearly forced. ""I still know Kung fu"" come on man....",4
1644,"Do yourself a favor and don't see this movie.I remember the landmark movie like it was yesterday. How many times do you make a movie that has people leaving the theater asking each other what kind of battery they would be?Then there was this. I was so ready for this movie, then I watched it and wish I'd never seen it honestly.In the first 30 minutes, this movie was trying to convince us that ""The Matrix"" is a video game. Well, that's where you lost me.I really can't say much more. Some of the high points were seeing Neo and Trinity together again, and as much as the video game theory made me unhappy, when they first figured it out all hell broke loose and it got at least action packed. I liked how she was married to this guy who was clearly not a super duper nice guy...then she ends up with Neo.The action was decent. So all of those things make it a 4/10 and not lower. Had there been zero plot or Neo and Trinity not gotten back together, it'd have been a 3 or 2 out of 10.",4
1645,"And if you do, don't wait to the credits scene, u are going to be more disappointed than the 2 hours 20 minutes.I totally respect Laurence and Hugo for not taking this movie, they did the best.",1
1646,"Something that started out rock solid super cool goes from a 10 to a 2 in 4 LOOOOONNNNG movies. I was hoping this was going to be the one that started The Matrix series back in upward movement, but clearly about 30 minutes in it just wasn't going to happen. Why oh why could they not do something cool with lots of energy. I understand why some decided not to return to this bloated love story that should have never been made.",3
1647,I don't understand what is wrong with everyone now a days. How can anyone even release this kind of **. Shame on all of them for ruining the Matrix. None of the actors ( except Keanu ) could act. What is up with trinity flying and neo needing trinity to be able to do anything. What a waste.,1
1648,Bad ending.when it was so bad that when I walked out the cinema I started hating the old ones too and I was in love with the old one. Really disappointing.,1
1649,"This was an absolute disgrace. 20 years in the making and this is what we get? Newcomers and next-gens might accept it, but for hard loyal Matrix fans this was a slap in the face. You had every opportunity to make this movie groundbreaking. We would have waited.I don't understand how anyone could think this movie was even slightly good.If we sit back and accept this trash, movie studios will think it's okay to keep serving it up to us, and worse yet, charge us for it!Months and months and months of training, planing and editing went into the first 3 movies, and it showed/paid off. This 4th instalment was rushed, neglected and spat on.Bad story, bad casting, bad lighting, bad effects, bad script, bad editing, bad colour grading, bad choreography, bad camera work, bad music and just downright disappointing.Just wasted over 2 hours of my life and I want them back.",1
1650,"S**t. It's what happens when you take a story and reopen it with 0 thought. The original was a movie experience like no other. Now you force in new storyline that were never meant to be there...turning what was a generational defining movie...into a joyless a cash grab. As this movie even says...""reboots make money""....and I want mine back.",1
1651,"I wish they kept me in the Matrix. Unaware of this movie. There is simply nothing good about this movie. Bad acting, bad cgi, bad story...Please take me back into the Matrix where only the 1st 3 movies exist.",1
1652,"I am a huge Matrix fan, and apart from the original they all have their flaws, but this one has the smarts and fear that the original has. The Matrix makes you wonder if we are in a computer generated world and if our life isn't real. In this one it makes you believe it more with the way the world is filled with hate and are we being controlled to fear each other by being under a higher power. The story is amazingly connected with the original 3, it has the action, the power of love with Neo and Trinity, it does have the Nostalgia but new at the same time. I was very impressed but I'm also a bigger fan of Resurrected than I am of Reloaded and I know that one was also frowned upon. Sit back, relax, and enjoy having this franchise back as much as I am.",10
1653,"It is like fan fiction, if it was told from the perspective of a retired Neo and half way through it a senile Trinity corrects Neo's senile ass on how things really happened, but then they both noticed they had pooped their adult diapers and walked hand in hand into the sunset.",4
1654,"If I had never watched a matrix movie, I would rate this a five. Knowing the source material, it gets a minus one for the blown expectations and another minus one for the inserted politics.I think the better story would have been telling the ""true"" story that the writers originally had. Humans weren't used as batteries. That's stupid. Humans were used for their organic computing power. The matrix existed within the unused parts of peoples brains linked together. This revelation would have been better than ""it was all a video game.""Alsoenough with the romanceIt is nice to have a man and woman together being celebratedBut still,give us an action movie that doesn't focus on romance.UgWarhammer 40k, where are you.",3
1655,"""All that Keanu Reeves touches cannot become gold"", but the story of this movie certainly seems to rely on that.The first Matrix movie was so perfect that it seemed logical to make the next one. But it was all downhill from there. Even though the next 2 movies were downgrade from the first one, we can still see countless videos of YouTubers and Literature students trying to connect these 3 movies philosophically. Well, I would like to see them try to explain this convoluted mess.I don't have a complain against the actors because they weren't given anything to perform with, and they had to make do with what they got. Jonathan Groff was a standout for me and Jessica Henwick was a welcome addition to the cast. Although I felt that the script didn't do justice to the legendary role of Morpheus, even with an actor as charismatic as Yahya Abdul Mateen II.Convoluted concepts were added and plot points introduced just so that they could look relevant but at the cost of retconing the legacy of the previous movies. Also, The movie's self awareness works against it in ways that make you cringe out. Overall, the plot seems confusing and kind of all over the place. Even the action scenes are not as polished as the original, suffering from bad CGI at times that feels superficial. And how in Neo's name did they manage to turn Bullet Time into a joke! That was really infuriating.I feel really bad that Keanu Reeves is in this movie, he was the sole reason I suffered through the entire thing.The Matrix Resurrections tarnishes the legacy of the original. Please avoid watching if you are a fan.",4
1656,"I wasn't expecting much given the Wachowskis track record since the first Matrix movie, but this was a disaster. The action is cut terribly and the set pieces are poor even compared to the earlier movies which are twenty years old. The whole thing is is so woke and meta it's almost painful. I'm actually stopping the review here because I'm getting angrier the more i think about the movie.",3
1657,"OMG how the old ones looks better than this. Many problems swatch colors, characters, Neo is not Neo anymore. Pet robots are terrible and Now has a super powers as Goku on Dragon Ball,",1
1658,"It's hard to believe this was written by one of the Watchowskis. The original series was brilliant and intelligent. This one is ridiculous, poorly written, and almost mocks the original films.",2
1659,"Everything is very bad in this film. Bad script, bad acting, terrible dialogue, bad CGI. The story of the film is very boring. This movie is empty and doesn't make any sense.Sorry Lana, but this is awful, don't make films anymore.",1
1660,"This is cheap fanfiction, as seen through the eyes of some of the original's creators. I really like Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, but this was not a good choice for them.I love the first film. It's a classic.Reloaded has some horrible scenes, but also a few great action sequences (The high way chase, burly brawl, chateau fight, etc).Even Revolutions had its moments, even though I would never say it's a good film.The Matrix Resurrections, however:has a horrible scripthas terrible editinglooks cheaphas no mind-bending actionhas a lot of miscastsis way too metahas a lackluster soundtracklacks consistency in its effectsOverall:I genuinely dislike this film. It's the Batman &amp; Robin of this franchise. Who knows, maybe someone like Christopher Nolan will reboot it in a few years.As it stands now, this is by far the worst Matrix film.1999: ""Free your mind!""2021: ""Blah blah blah...""Now, gimme the pill that will make me forget this mess...",4
1661,The Matrix was a revolutionary movie. We had never seen anything like that before. It was way ahead of its time. The sequels were nowhere near the original but still were quite good on their own accord. The trilogy was built to be a completion of the story. And the humans and machines lived happily ever after. Until some greedy producers saw this as a cash grab opportunity. This movie was never meant to exist. Nothing about it feels like it belongs to the same universe. Morpheus and Agent Smith were replaced by spoof characters. Stylish action sequences were replaced by laughably bad sequences. Some people might say it is a philosophical movie. I say it even fails in that. The first three had a clear ideology while in this the message is convoluted and poorly demonstrated. It is a pathetic excuse of a movie. Only Keanu and Carrie Ann are in top form. Its sad to watch them trying to give their best in a hopeless situation.,4
1662,"I just have one comment on this movie - why Lana , why ? Couldnt you leave the movie whit the first three movies alone . You made a trash from this movie ? You could have a plot of tye matrix in 1970 and it would be more better than this one.",2
1663,"Resurrections presents a new Matrix, less the alienated corporate world of 1999 and more a frenetic 2021 with modern stressors and fraught feelings. As such, the updated aesthetics of Resurrections appear justified; handheld close up photography, gold rather than green and casual, self-awareness rather than a host of finely coiffured characters.The new aesthetic, however, does not impress quite like the original trilogy. The shaky camera masks any precision in choreography and set-pieces don't strike with the same impact and sense of awe. The narrative and its characters, while modern in their looser, meta-aware style neither feel like the Matrix nor build a world that's particularly interesting. Injecting humour and asides may well be more '2021' but a host of broad characters, some new and some old, feel like they'd be more suited to a fast-quipping Marvel movie.The film also suffers from the old Wachowski curse; intense action interspersed with tedious plot exposition. The Matrix, with its mind bending premise, got away with this, Reloaded perhaps did so for fans of philosophy and the less said about Revolutions the better. Resurrections, with a 2.5 hour runtime, leans heavily on explicit exposition with critical ideas often told rather than shown. One voice over sequence in particular feels like an Ocean's 11 heist rather than a developed Sci-Fi film.While fans of the series, let down by the 2nd and 3rd films, may be looking for a 'Matrix redemption', I certainly hope that won't be the title of the next film; this franchise still needs no sequel.",5
1664,"The only reason people rate this movie so low is because their brain are too slow to comprehend things, or are unable to do so at all. Marvel fanboys and such who can name all the heroes, but can't name their own presidents or states, probably also think world is still flat. Those are the people with no objective thinking at all.Matrix 4 had everything executed perfectly, i was watching the movie and waiting for all these ''flaws'' these dummies complained about. None of that were in the movie.This movie did justice to the previous three, answered the questions, that were't answered before. Story was extremely well thought through and executed. I respect that. It gave closure to the whole story.If you think this movie is bad and only first one is good or first three of them, i advice you to rewatch all of them again, because clearly you didn't get a damn thing what was going on even in the first Matrix.And for those who have a brain on their shoulders, go watch first three movies, if you hadn't, then watch this one and you will understand what I meant..",10
1665,"I waited a few days to write this because I wanted to be fair. I think everyone who watches this will agree that the original Matrix is one of the best films ever made and is perfect in many ways. Opinion is then split on the sequels 2 an 3. I think though few will say they managed the same quality (or anywhere near) as the original, some people think they are good films nevertheless and others were significantly disappointed. I think what it comes down to is what you prioritise in a movie and what you like most about the original Matrix. If you love it for the amazing revolutionary action sequences and production techniques used to capture them and the high octane style and engaging surface level story about man vs machine, then you may be forgiving to Matrix 2 and 3 as they also feature lots of the same. However, if like me you loved the Matrix for its totally original concept and story that touches on interesting philosophical and spiritual concepts and the fully fledged characters who are the vehicle to present this, then you probably were disappointed by the Matrix 2 and 3 because they were severely lacking in depth and intellectual and emotional engagement.So when it comes to Matrix 4, it is broadly the same. I think if you sit in the former camp then you will probably find a fair bit to enjoy, there is a good amount of action and stylistically it continues and pays homage to the original film. However, if you sit in the latter camp then you will probably be disappointed as once again there is not much depth in Matrix 4. The story feels like a strain in order to make sense. There are lots of glaring logical holes that you are required to leap over. It offers some but not much intellectual stimulation. And the relationship between Neo and Trinity is interesting but the most emotionally affecting love story ever told.An important final note is that what really jars and is very disappointing is that they recast Morpheus and Agent Smith, two absolutely iconic characters from the original movies. So Hugo Weaving's wonderful elocution and portrayal of Smith is totally missing. And Lawrence Fishbourne's gravitas and strength and leadership qualities as Morpheus is totally missing and both new actors are rather poor imitations. And perhaps what is most sad about this is that apparently there was no real reason for this - Fishbourne has said that he would like to have been a part but wasn't asked, and Weaving says he would have liked to have been a part but he was scheduled to be doing something else at the time. This recasting alone will really offend fans and is a huge oversight.",6
1666,"This review is written by a person who owns the first three Matrix films on DVD and loves them. Watching this movie is the equivalent of going to a restaurant that you haven't been to in 20 years, it's still owned by the same person but that person has lost their mind and they've also lost all their talent and creativity and now they just phone it in because they know people are going to come and spend their money there regardless of the quality of what they are producing.Terrible script, bad acting, lousy underwhelming cast, laughably bad special effects, and incredibly silly notions (I could expound but I want this to be spoiler free).Watch out of curiosity if you want, like I did, but if you're older than 40, I would pass. Life is very short and this is 2.5 hours of watching hot garbage cook in the sun.",1
1667,"This was only a little better than day old diarrhea because Keanu Reeves is in it, but that's about it.Taking anything good and stuffing Left/Right agenda into it is all I see nowadays, and this is no exception.",1
1668,"Visually it wasn't bad, i bet it took a lot of effort to create it.Story wise, i didn't like it... It's ALL about reuniting trinity and neo.There was only a few 3-4 minutes when PH's character (analyst) said something about the herd wanting to stay like that which i liked and found interesting. The rest, meh.",4
1669,"Over all very poorly executed matrix movie. It was groundhogs day meets Matrix Revelations. Keanu was great as always. But the story was very poorly written and felt scattered. The Matrix films got worse as you went along this film is no exception to that trend. By far the worst Matrix film. I'd be willing to wager that 20% of the films screen time was just ""flashbacks"" of the original trilogy. The film was very slow moving then there was a 1 fight scene that wasn't really a fight scene... roll credits with a terrible rage against the machine cover. The entire fight felt like the Revelations ending but instead of an entire city of Smiths its an entire city of ""bots"" called the swarm. Only difference was now neo wasnt alone. There are 2 the ones???Just felt cheesy and not true to the original feel and concept.",3
1670,"This was a disgrace to the Matrix franchise and film making in general. In fact movies in the Cinema and Streaming platforms are beginning to get worse and worse every year. You would think with their huge budgets they would of respected the franchises high standards of movie making but this film was a complete let down in every way, Cast, Storyline, script, Acting, fight scenes, logic, special effects and so on.",4
1671,"This isn't a reboot or reimagining of the trilogy. It's more like a bad parody, just without any humor. Honestly, it's so bad I am not sure how to feel. It's almost like it was tailored made to enrage fans of the original Matrix while blatantly cashing in on the IP.Yet another great series falls casualty to idiots. At least it was free on HBO.",3
1672,This was a shame... I was really hoping it would have been good. But it was just a huge let down. Not sure why this movie was even made to be honest. I do not recommend it.,1
1673,"This has gotta be one of the most boring and convoluted movies I have seen in the last decade. Every single scene is plagued with paragraphs among paragraphs of montone exposition that explains what's going on in the movie. They go so far into detail about this generic sci fi universe the matrix lives in that I feel like I could give a report over it. Nobody cares about this movie and it's so apparent. The actors suck, the cinematography and colors looks like a hallmark movie and the plot is the most generic stuff I have ever heard. Keanu Reaves especially sounds like he's about to fall asleep between each line and honestly I don't blame him. I would rather relive getting my tonsils taken out without anesthesia than watch this movie again.",2
1674,"I gotta say. I really enjoyed it. The plot was good, but predictable. Which is fine. Love NPH in his role. Action was good...though a little limited. Overall the movie served its purpose gracefully...TO BE ENTERTAINING. I like a lot of you hold the original trilogy near and dear, and I feared (still kind of fear) that they are going to do the same thing that happened with the star wars re boot...start off strong and then just utterly fail. This movie may have been a little rushed...meaning...too much in one film. Maybe could have expanded a little bit and made it two films. Time will tell. It was nice being able to watch on HBO Max, so I could rewind and catch what was said. Made it a lot easier to process than when I saw I saw the first in the theatre.Overall really good job done.",8
1675,"What about the movie ? Nothing, ridiculous, would have been a good idea 20years ago MAYBE, but today its a hasbeen movie scene by scene, line byl ine, predictable as bad b series.Bad realisation, bad acting, and i mean bad...soooo bad its insane. Keanu is barely an actor but poor guy has his brain fried. Moves like a sick person, speaks like a cretin....glad i saw it in 2021, it wont ruin 2022.",1
1676,"Resurrections brings us back to The Matrix proper. We're introduced to modals, free-thinking sentient machines working with real-life humans (these are not Borgs), sentient Matrix-based code that can now live in the outside world, that long life is possible (Neo and Trinity age minimally in 60 years), that real-world resurrection/rebirth is possible (AI as the new god?).We catch a glimpse into AI's own civil war via flashbacks (occurs after the original trilogy) and the ongoing politics. This is fascinating on its own and probably deserves its own movie (yes, please) in order to understand the motivations of AI better.We even have a new Zion (named IO) that's much more livable (and hopeful).This was some great stuff!Many did not like the (long) backstories for Neo and Trinity (on first watch). Neo a game developer creating a kinda' parody of Matrix 1-3. Trinity a soccer mom.I found these backstories engaging because they impressed upon the viewer the power that is the Matrix. Anything can make sense. You can essentially be ""resurrected"" into a completely new person. This was touched on with Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) in Matrix 1. This time we saw the end results, especially with Tiffany/Trinity.Amazing to see this is action. This is the actual Matrix. Ironically, many did not like the real Matrix flexing its power.I think that, given time, people will watch this film again (for the first time). They'll see that this wasn't a cash grab. Instead it was a tightly written story that truly ""resurrected"" the franchise while using nostalgia to pull in new viewers (Matrix 3 is nearly two decades old). Plus a great supporting cast led by Jessica Henwick.I do still have these nagging questions... Why must there always be saviors trying to rewrite everything in their image? What's the end game? The truth as it involves a new evolution for humans?Is The Matrix really that bad considering that the real-world is essentially unlivable and yet found a way to allow the conquered to go on ""living""?",10
1677,Should never been released it's unreal how bad and cheap this movie felt. Whoever made it should never make any movies I can't wrap my mind around how such a good actor agreed to this.,1
1678,"They continued the storyline, they explained what appeared to be Neo's death in movie 3, they brought back plenty of original actors, and the whole saga look and feel remained the same. They did NOT reboot the series, rewrite canon or all this other junk hollywood seems to be doing to movies today ""just to make a buck"".PLUS... a new city, humans and machines working together, and Neil Patrick Harris makes an excellent antagonist as a new character in the movie. A thoroughly enjoyable watch. If you gave this movie anything below a 5 rating, you already hated the first 3 movies anyways. Why even watch the 4th then? Just move along.... Go make a TikTok video or something.",10
1679,"This movie ruined all the good memory and feelings I had from the previous three. While they tried hard to pull out a story of how resurrection was possible, the story was not well-thought. A lot of long and boring conversations to convince you why they made Matrix IV (and probably more to come!). The director did not do a great job in introducing the new characters and their purposes, you will remember only a couple of them after all.The camera and acting are significantly worse than the previous three. Even as an individual movie, I would rank it as bad. With all the budget and resources, they could do much better.",3
1680,"I'm so glad I have HBOMax. I literally skipped through the entire movie only to never find the ""good parts"".I wanted desperately for this to be good! It was NOT. That said, if you like a scrambled mess of a terrible story line coupled with a dash of grade C effects, this is your movie.",1
1681,"I really wanted to like it. It was tolerable up until the point where Trinity developed superpowers. Then it became just another political piece of trash. The fighting scenes were worse than the original, how is that possible. The storyline felt like it was rushed. Unfortunately this is a completely forgettable movie. I need to go back and watch the original just to wash the stench off me.",4
1682,"The movie was awesome and I do not understand the bad criticsI watched the Matrix when I was a teenager. I loved the movie.And then 2 other movies came out and they were too much to handle.I doubt if many people remember that happened in Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions.The only thing I remember from Matrix Reloaded was the Architect talking and talking and talking, Monica Belucci and 2 guys with blond rasta hair?Matrix Revolutions was all about sentinelsSentinels all over the place. I did not remember anything else.And then this movie comes along. And it is greatI loved everything about the movie. The new crew was cool, the Analyst was awesome and so was Agent Smith.The moment Trinity gained her conciousness it was a very powerful moment. I loved everything about the new movie (except the attack of the weird people dressed in costumes???)The chemistry between Neo and Trinity was even better in this movie.I watched a movie with a very interesting plot, many many surprises and it was loaded with action.I mean what do people really want these days to appreciate a movie?Marvel movies are usually fun but that is all there is to them and they get rated 8+ stars almost every time they come out.And the moment Matrix Resurrections came out it was flooded with negative comments. I mean why???The movie has everything. It is totally unexpected and a fresh breath of cinematography and at the same time it encompasses material from the first movie but without this making it unoriginal bcs they do not follow the path of the first movie. It was more as a tribute not as a remake or something. I do not get the hate for this movie.I am very disappointed with my fellow Imdb reviewers because there is no way this movie can be rated less than 7 stars.It feels intentional.",10
1683,"Unfortunately not as good as previous sequels. Side cast lacks charisma and chemistry that previous crew had, even Neo was wooden through movie, only Jessica Henwick was standing out in terms of acting.Some fighting scenes were bunch of sequence that were 2 seconds with shaking camera that where happening too fast so you cannot see who is hitting who or what is going on. There was not continuity or flow through fights so you as a viewer can make comprehensible sense of the scene.Soundtrack which was previously superb in previous installments was nowhere equally good same goes for main villain which has no charisma as Agent Smith. Only good thing is White Rabbit track.One part of movie consists of sequences from previous installments not sure what is the point of them or repeating dialogue which we already heard. This also makes film unnecessarily too long and stretched.At first I didnt like the message that movie tries to send, now that I think about it has perfect sense, emotions and love are most important things in life. Authors knew that so that's why they decided to use love of their fans for the franchise to quickly grab as much money as possbile unfortunately what they didnt realise is that you need to give something in return for that love.",2
1684,"She actually just made a parody of the matrix. Waste of time, hopefully this is the end of the matrix. Turning the Merovingian into a reddit mod was funny tho.",1
1685,"My wife, our 2 daughters and I sat down to watch on HBO tonight. We were interested in watching it after having showed the girls the trilogy recently. Our oldest was disgusted with it within 5 minutes and left for her room rather than watch the rest, our youngest stayed maybe 15 minutes longer but was just sitting in the room playing her switch before she left to play in the other room. My wife fell asleep a few minutes later.What is wrong with it? Well its a load of regurgitated bullcrap with main roles having been recast, and there is so much that appears to be done strictly out of nostalgia that it is sickening. Thr original was so full of imagination and ideas that were practically mind blowing, this has none of that.",1
1686,"I don't know why ms. Vachovski want to make the fourth part of Matrix. As for me, the story was finished in ""Revolution"". Unfortunately, the ""Resurrections"" is reboot that nobody needed.Firstly, the scenario is a little bit strange, it has a lot of gaps, and questions without answers. It shows old characters in new world. But their decisions are very strange sometimes.Secondly the cast good. Of course, Keanu Reeves and Ann-Moss are amazing, but others is just doing their job.Thirdly, the action itself is good, but it's not awesome how it was in trilogy.So, it's reboot making without any purpose.",6
1687,The movie Cats made more sense than this. I didn't understand what the purpose of this movie was. It's a farce. Not even so bad it's good. Avoid at all costs.,2
1688,"While there are a couple of interesting ideas, and some clever, self-aware jokes, overall I found this a bit dull. The new characters are mostly bland, and the action sequences just don't have the snap of the original trilogy. And.no offense to Jonathan Groff, but his new incarnation of Agent Smith is a pale imitation of Hugo Weaving. I didn't hate it, but I have no desire to ever watch it again. And even Revolutions was worth a second watch.",5
1689,"In the Matrix trilogy, there are 4 main characters. #1 Neo #2 Morpheus#3 Trinity and #4 Mr Smith. This movie needed Mr Smith, but no Morpheus?I whole so big, so deep, they didn't even begin to fill.The movie is very slow in some areas, especially all the computer coding talk. If you play ""The Matrix"" drinking game, and take a drink every time they say ""The Matrix,"" not only don't drive, but seek medical attention.But if Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving were in it, and they edited it better, it would have been a great movie. Instead I give it a meh.",5
1690,"They wrecked Star Wars, they wrecked Star Trek, they wrecked Tron &amp; Dune, they wrecked Indiana Jones, and now they wrecked The Matrix.I went to see The Matrix in 1999 when it came out in the theater. It was one of the best experiences in a theater in my life. Right up there next to Blade Runner and Spinal Tap.I'm so glad I only had to stream Resurrections on HBOMax and not waste my money. This sequal makes 2016's all-girl Ghostbusters look like a masterpiece by comparison. Matrix Resurrections tries to erase, undo and retell the fantastic story the first film and its lesser two sequels accomplished. Instead of having an arc Matrix Resurrections has a sexual identity agenda. Absolute dumpster fire garbage.Please God don't let them wreck Serenity.",4
1691,"Let's get through the problems first:It just doesn't feel like a Matrix film. Seems lacking in those subtle audio effects that you associate with a film and the colour score is way too vivid &amp; the same throughout the whole film. Just doesn't seem right!Next, the original premise at the start is good and gets you thinking. Then in a split second, it's ruined and you're rushed into act 2.I'm guessing the film was heavily edited as Smith is there, then he's not, then he appears again with no real reasoning and then vanishes again. And finally appears again, just to disappear for a final time. No real explanation as to why he's even there!So the war is over but they're still running &amp; hiding from the sentinels!! Eh?!?Poor editing? Or just glaring plot holes?On the plus, great action sequences and the effects are top notch as always.And instead of ""Bullet Time"", I'm guessing we're calling it ""Stop Time""?Acting wise, top marks for the actors who seem to really enjoy their roles and it does show.Potential for another film with the ending..Again, I'm very ""Hmm"" at the moment.. Think it needs a second watch at some point and then an update to this review.",5
1692,"""The Matrix Resurrections"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie and the fourth movie of the ""The Matrix"" franchise, in which we watch the two realities come together and Mr. Anderson needs to find and follow the correct one.Since I had already watched the trilogy, I knew the story behind it but I did not know what to expect from this fourth movie. After watching it I understand why a lot of people were disappointed by it and the main reason was that they expected too much. The plot was for one more time interesting and it was really nice watching again some of the main characters. The interpretations of Keanu Reeves who played as Neo, Carrie-Anne Moss who played as Trinity, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who played as Morpheus and Jessica Henwick who played as Bugs were very good. In conclusion, I have to say that ""The Matrix Resurrections"" is a nice movie but if you have high expectations I am sure you will be disappointed.",7
1693,"I am a super fan of original Matrix and enjoyed the other two films as well (even though they were weaker). But this new version is a joke. Every single scene of this film is cringey, unoriginal, and bleak. Acting is horrible, Jada Pinket Smith is the worst. I really did not care if someone dies. The original Matrix had groundbreaking special effects for its period. Yet, this version has the cheapest effects I've seen even though our tecnologies have improved dramatically over the years. The entire film is dumb and pointless. I do not understand why the studios continue to give the Wachovskis any money. They failed every single project they were involved in since the first Matrix.",1
1694,With a collation of poor cgi weird acting and out of place Disney type additions set against a backdrop of actually a good storyline was just confusing.Shame to waste the name on this that deserved a good reboot but not worth a watch.,3
1695,"Boring, slow and not a matrix film.Keanu is bad, the new characters are forgettable and the constant need to show clips of the old films is awful.I turned this off half way through, then I thought, no it's the matrix try again... 15 minutes later, turned off again.Simply awful, save yourself from it.",1
1696,"As with many 4th sequels, this falls short of being anything unique, special or captivating.The original films were CGI, spectacular bullet time fight scenes and powerful characters, this round, they just decided to just throw in the same recipe and see if they can a new cake.... the result was weak bad guys, repetitive scripts from the good guys and nothing that felt 'edge of your seat'I must admit, I wasn't expecting much, but this actually fell short of even my low expectations.Watch it for the curiosity factor but feel free to pull out your knitting to keep you entertained.",3
1697,Are you kidding? You could have made a movie like this by a new name - Catrix makes sense! - with same casts and crew...Why did you bring such a horrible disaster to The Metrix philosophy?! Why ruining all those all deep concepts with this shallow cheap action/Bollywood move? Big big mistake for you to make and for me to watch!,3
1698,"The Matrix (1999) is an iconic sci-fi action film. I've seen all the sequels, animated shorts, online &amp; console games. I know for a fact they exist, but after 2 decades of additional material, you know what I've learned? Ignorance would be bliss. My mother has only seen the first movie, and as far as she's concerned, that's all there is. I envy her.The amazing thing about the first Matrix movie is that it doesn't have a definitive ending. The movie peaks with the promise that Neo will bring hope to those of us kept prisoner by the machines. We get confirmation that he is The One, and he will likely save those who are a part of the system, including the viewer. He addresses the audience with a statement of hope, and then looks directly at the camera to confirm he's speaking to us, not just the NPCs in the film.But then, the subsequent movies are like ""nah, he was kinda The One...but there were others first. There will be more later. Keanu Reeves is also kinda The One. And Trinity is, too. But it doesn't ultimately matter because the Matrix can just be rebooted if need be.""A good metaphor for the entire franchise is the character of Agent Smith. I love that villain and the performance, but he was destroyed at the end of the first movie and it was gloriously satisfying. I was so pleased when he was finally obliterated by Neo. The end....But then, he was back...then there are hundreds of him...then he was human...then he was The Oracle...then he was an army of flying fighting dudes and so on. Every new moment with him lessened the impact of the original ""defeat"". Just like all these new films weaken and dilute the joy of the original.This movie is the Jesus film Abed was trying to make on Community. It's the equivalent of how the Game Of Thrones final seasons weren't just bad, they killed everyone's enthusiasm for the entire brand.Do you remember in all the early years of Game Of Thrones, or (more on topic) the first Matrix, where a character does something startling and you think ""I can't believe he did that! Damn you, Cypher, you traitor!""? That emotion where you are shocked at the story and you hold the story and characters responsible? It's the joy of being deeply invested in a show or movie. But then these Matrix sequels (or last 2 seasons of GOT) come along and you switch from condemning the actions of the villains to blaming the producers and writers because you've been knocked out of the fantasy. You are abruptly reminded that this is all just deliberate decisions of cynical artists who are annoyed by their earlier work and the public's interpretations of it. It sucks. Its the opposite of entertainment. I don't mind if I need to play a companion game or to read a supplemental graphic novel to understand parts of a movie, but I'll be damned if I'm going to have to keep up with a director's Twitter comments to get certain references and decisions made in their new project. Social media is reality (for the most part) it's the opposite of fun entertaining fantasy. I watched Greyhound last night (after I watched The Matrix 4) and at no point during the film did Tom Hanks' character spot a glove that one of his crew dropped on the deck and photograph it, then share the photograph with others. If you understand that last comment, you can sympathize with how I felt watching The Matrix Resurrections last night. I was constantly pulled out of the fantasy because I was constantly being made to think ""Oh...this is why they did that"" because of real world decisions that motivated the choices on screen. And you can absolutely make points about issues or correct parts of your franchise that people miss-interpreted or intentionally distorted to suit their own agenda, but you need to do it in a way that isn't so blatantly obvious.And stop with all the meta nonsense. To quote a great woman: ""I'm reacting the way the world does to movies about making movies about making movies. I mean, come on Charlie Kaufman, some of us have work in the morning. Damn.""",5
1699,"Greetings from Texas.I have the highest respect for Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss. But what can any actor do with a script that couldn't get a passing grade in an introductory screenwriting class?The ""Matrix Resurrections"" script is so bad, it should be held up as an example of what not to do as a screenwriter. The idea that anyone would put money behind this script, which is like a first draft written by a 14-year-old boy in a hurry, truly shocks me.Funny how the quality of the three sequel scripts doesn't come close to the quality of the first script. It's almost as if the first script in the series was written by someone who knew what they were doing.I was excited to watch this movie, and I tried really hard to hang in there. But at minute 17:00, after being pummeled by the clunkiest dialogue I've heard in years, I couldn't take it anymore.The movie has been playing in the background as I write this. Still waiting for one good line of dialogue. Man, oh man.I hope everyone has a great day.",1
1700,I couldn't stay awake even after consuming 4 coffees ( 1 of which was a venti from Starbucks) and one energy drink. The only thing which kept me awake during the first hour were my popcorns. Dissapointing.,2
1701,"This is a sad shell of a story. I'm so sorry they dragged Keanu Reeves into this mess. Purple hair ""hero string woman"" from nowhere without character depth, diversity, diversity, diversity!!!Decent action though. I've seen better in John Wick but this will do for a boring Monday night.",3
1702,"I wanted to like it. I really wanted to like it......but this film spends the first 30-45 minutes caught up in flashbacks of the original trilogy on order to remind the audience of the plot, only to throw it all away trying to claim it's own identity, and then follows it all up with bad action and terrible acting. It quickly becomes clear that the Matrix Resurrections is quite literally a 'greatest hits' mix tape of it'self. Or worse yet a bad cover band of a cover band.These never-ending 'meta' references makes it feel like they are trying to beat you over the head with how smart they are for making them in the first place.There are 2+ hours of exposition, and makes up the majority of dialogue, and most of it is sarcastically delivered by NPH.It devolves into a series of Deus Ex Machina moments with previous franchise characters randomly showing up at the exact time they are 'needed.' Eventually it becomes so bad it turns into a masterclass in how not to write a film.The worst part of all was that there was nothing in this film that even remotely resembled the action and uniqueness of the original trilogy. The absence of anything close to Yuen Wo-ping's choreography exists in this film. His work defined those films so much so, that you could say he put as much, if not more effort, into creating the world of the Matrix as the Wachowski's. Yet somehow they have stolen his work. And have replaced it with God-awful shaky-cam sequences, WHILE STILL COPYING the choreography and settings of the originals.OK and now the rant:The acting is TERRIBLE throughout. Overacting is bad enough but the main cast is just lazy. I'd prefer overacting to be honest. Perhaps they thought the IP would be enough to pull them through the garbled and poorly written dialogue, but this whole cast feel so... disconnected from each other.The crew of the ship seem more interested in posing for the camera, than acting. They are all so bad its laughable.Also, I could barely hear what they were saying at times, especially when the blue haired girl was speaking. Lady, please speak up, we paid good money to watch this.Morpheus 2.0 spends half his screen time doing a bad impression of Laurence Fishburne and looking at himself in the mirror. He's just bad, and he's completely disconnected from anyone he's working with. It's the same with Neo Smith, a hollow impression of a much better actor.Knowing how much KR has put into the JW series in regards to weapons training and hand to hand combat, only to see Neo become as neutered the director of this film is, was a terrible choose and a massive waste of real-world talent. Being forced to watch him scene by scene overly-emasculated, and lets face it, BORING, was the worst part of this film by a long shot.CAM was pretty good, but unfortunately her dialogue is some of the most poorly written in the film. It creates not just the largest plot-holes of the whole franchise. I guess everything that has happened before this film, no longer matters? For a film that is being somehow being lauded for it's female empowerment and gender-identity strengths, it's pretty degrading to her character as well. Trinity's screen time is fairly sparse compared to the rest of the cast. And if you've seen the trailer, you'll note she has a family in this version of the matrix. They are portrayed as terribly bratty kids, and her husband is bullish jerk (who has hands down one of the worst lines in the film right at the climax). Her family barely adds any consequence to her choices. Actually it makes Trinity a pretty terrible mother, and they feel like some kind of afterthought they threw in at the last minute.This is not the epilogue that fans deserved. Not even close.It's a terrible attempt by an aging studio, and a confused director (who, lets face it, has always been much more 'miss' than she has ever been 'hit') in order to grab as much cash as they can out of their intellectual property before people catch on to their scam. But I'm not surprised considering how bad this two-and-a-half hour dumpster fire really is. It's a coffin nail in a steadily declining IP.It's an absolute travesty. This movie spits in the face of it's predecessors and it's fan-base.",1
1703,"An absolutely dreadful film. I sat eagerly waiting for this to start and even felt a slight shiver of excitement when I saw the green matrix dots dripping down the screen in the opening seconds. However, I very suddenly had a bad feeling about this within the first few minutes....I purposely avoided the reviews for this film because wanted to experience it the same way I did the original in 1999, but trust me this is not even in the same league as the original Matrix movie!I love Keanu as an actor - and Carrie Ann-Moss always give a good performance - but I genuinely cannot explain what I've witnessed in this movie. It's like everyone involved in the original trilogy got together in a room and tried to think of as many ways as possible to completely destroy what has gone before it. As much as I want to give an informative review, I simply cannot explain it what I've just seen!Poor acting - forgettable characters - absurd plot - wokism's all over the place - and absolutely the most unforgivable thing of all......rubbish choreography!! The fight scenes that made the original Matrix so revolutionary have been reduced to choppy, terribly edited scenes that make Taken 3 look like a gamechanger!I hold onto the hope that Keanu and Carrie committed to this film due to a friendship and loyalty to Lana - but in reality I think they may have regrets about ever getting involved in it. There's no doubt about it - this is dreadful!The first Matrix film will forever be a classic, but this one is worse than you could ever imagine a 'fourth' movie could be. I can honestly say that Universal Soldier 4 is a better sequel than this.Thankfully Keanu still has the John Wick franchise to continue with and good luck to him because they are superb! Hopefully this movie will kill the Matrix films off for good - otherwise we're in danger of stepping into Die Hard 5 territory here....",2
1704,"The scene where Neo is being told that Warner Brothers are making a sequel to the Matrix with or without him is about as genuine as this trash gets. Which is then followed by a room of clueless people brainstorming what the Matrix trilogy meant to them, and they landed on ""Bullettime"". That pretty much sets the tone for the whole movie. They have no understanding of what made the original Matrix great, and have no point to make in the sequel. Utter garbage.",1
1705,"When the trailers released for this movie, I was excited for this movie more than I have been in a while, so you would have understood my disappointment that it hardly lived up to any of those expectations.The movie isn't completely terrible, it added a bit of new lore, and the updated CGI on The Machine World looks great. But it has none of that (reality is an illusion, just electrical nerve signals, philosophical paranoia the first one had with interesting philosophy and revolutionary and kickass action sequences) This movie had none of that.Keanu and Carrie Anne Moss are the only two original actors in the entire movie. Morpheus makes a re-appearence, but not by Laurence Fishburne, and this Morpheus isn't actually Morpheus, but a program who thinks he's Morpheus. The writing for this character was so confusing and rushed that I didn't understand his motivation at all. He should have had a few scenes where he questioned himself and a bit more backstory.Though the new lore is good. Where the movie fails is the action. Not only it doesn't live up to the origional movies, It's bad even by todays action movie. Even the bike chase scene in Venom was far superior to the one in this movie which was so slow, boring and lacking any kind of kinetic energy.Neo has no powers whatsoever in this movie until the very last scene. He teases taking off and flying at one point, but is thrown away in such a cringy old fart excuse for a comedy gag. Neil Patrick Harris also played a very corny villan too. I liked how Carrie Anne Moss made a return as Trinity, but she hardly did anything in the movie too.Overall, though there are some good elements to this movie such as the updated and more clear look of the real world, this was mostly disappointing. It's sad that a bloody Matrix movie has given me no real desire to rewatch it after only seeing it twice in the theater.",5
1706,"Not sure who's decision it was to recast Morpheus &amp; Agent Smith, but it completely ruined the film. You can't have a movie with this much nostalgia and NOT BRING BACK THE MAIN ACTORS! The nostalgia is the main point that people wanted to see this. Read the room.",3
1707,"Pretty disappointing. I guess it's just hard to come up with something as good as the original. Either was sort of boring exposition, or just some action that didn't do anything new. All the slo-mo visual effects felt lazy, blurry and cheap. Like they just pushed a slow-mo button but didn't do anything new like the original did. Neo just had so little to do or say and even Trinity didn't have much going on either for being the centerpiece of the film. Just Meh. I'd rather just go and watch the Original or even #2 before watching this one again. Bummer.",6
1708,"No need to alert for spoilers cause we've already seen it all before. I kept waiting for the deep part to begin. Then it was over. Sooo much dialog saying nothing trying to sound prolific. A simple love story with no real depth or relevance with a cliche ending about ""sheeple"".Horrible out of touch writing. Children might like it...maybe not, cartoons have more complex and dynamic storylines. Totally riding on the coat tails of the success of Matrix the original...all the rest seem plagiarized...especially this one.",
1709,There's an explanation for this terrible movie.The industry is struggling and many of its employees have had little work over the last 2 years.Keane doesn't need this but many others did. He did everyone a really nice favour and made this movie to help them out.,2
1710,"They could've done so much with this movie.. but this was a big fail. I can't wrap my head around that Matrix 1 came out 1999 and was so much better in every aspect than this. I still remember those epic fight scenes in the Trilogy and can't remember a single one from Matrix 4 that I watched yesterday. Those fighting scenes were poorly choreographed and everyone involved just seemed helpless. Also what kind of plot is this? The Matrix Trilogy was so smart, the philosophy behind it, the story- it was mind-blowing. But the plot of Matrix Resurrections is a joke, it feels like a rom-com, it's basically a love story about Neo and Trinity. Just cringeworthy. What's with the war between the machines and humankind? Does no one want to destroy the matrix anymore and get everyone out? Nope...And Agent Smith is now Neo's buddy? This just doesn't make any sense, I can't believe what Lana Wachowski did with her masterpiece..And people rate this a 10/10, does Warner Bros pay them or something?",2
1711,"I watched it today and I think it's one of the worst sequels I've ever seen in my life. As an original Matrix fan I'm heavily disappointed. The costumes were horrible, not even close to the dark and edgy goth designs in the first. Where's the underground techno and break beat music? This is a woke netflix version of the matrix. Please don't waste your time if you liked the original and loved the underground feeling it gave and all the philosophy that it contained. Just a big money grab on matrix fans this one. I can't even sleep. It didn't even feel like a matrix film. Felt like a stupid action blockbuster.",1
1712,"Was this a sequel or a parody?! Keanu Reeves from Bill &amp; Ted is here.. Small cameo from Carrie Anne Moss..No Lawrence Fishburne nor Hugo Weaving.. Kids playing the Matrix ""game"".. wtf is that.. nonsensical mumbo-jumbo at its finest.. and wtf Neil Patrick Harris is doing here?!",1
1713,"Hire writers and directors for diversity sake and this is what you get. Terrible cash grab sequel that nobody wanted. Horrible blue haired feminists talk and do things, is what sums up this movie. So bad I didn't even finish it, and that was after fast forwarding through parts. Don't spend money to watch this... don't even watch it for free.",2
1714,"Money grab no need to say more. But if I had to I wouldn't watch on box office. Maybe discount bargin bin, actually nah not even that. Maybe rental???",2
1715,"Like many other fans of the franchise I was really, really looking forward to this, apart from some neat story twists and the moments of nostalgia I found myself struggling to stay awake.Maybe the pacing is off or the runtime is too long but it just seems so...dull in parts. I won't leave any spoilers in here but some of the acting is surprisingly wooden.The standout for me and the only character I was pleasantly surprised by was Jessica Henwicks character, excellent acting and more believable than Keanus Neo. He legitimately seemed to be just trudging through the film.Ultimately, I don't think this film needed to be made, I don't like the story arc, I found it boring and just too long and confusing at times, the story seems to be all over the place.I'm sure fans will watch this anyway, but prepare to be sadly disappointed.",3
1716,"Omg I knew this was bad from all the reviews but really nobody could prepare me that it would be THAT bad.Please Hollywood stop trying to cash on nostalgia. Let franchises like Terminator, Bourne or Matrix where they belong, in their glorious past.This was a movie that nobody asked and had NOTHING to tell. Fight scenes were so poor, CGI was so inferior than the one 20 years ago !!PS : You managed to ruin the coolest bad guy of all times (Agent Smith) ...PS2 : I'll just erase it from my memory. One star because you tried to ruin my favorite movie trilogy.",1
1717,Should of left the franchise alone ... move was like seeing a comedy ... of mistakes .. the original cast should fell embarrassed this was made . Movie just to make a buck ... Shame on them !!!,2
1718,"A sequel that completely destroys the Matrix myth.I felt embarrassed while watching the movie, which is nothing more than a political statement (poorly conceived) and a failed metaphor about today's society. Screenwriters should be ashamed.",3
1719,"Looks like some terrible TV movie rip off of The Matrix, total tripe that didn't need to be made and quite frankly shouldn't have been made I'm sure Laurence Fishburne is breathing a sigh of relief that he wasn't asked to be part of this mess.",2
1720,This movie is a shame and the cast is just terrible. A hipster agent smith and Morpheus? A kiddy Crew with terrible actors. Why to they ruin a decent movie?1 star for Keanu and 1 star for the effects.,2
1721,"The matrix was and will always remain an icon... a style icon in everything... in terms of costumes of heroes, color correction of the frame, fresh camera angles that violate the postulates of Hollywood, polished dialogues, from which there is nothing to remove and nothing to add, music that caused emotions and goosebumps, special effects, which after a quarter of a century look very, very impressive and most importantly appropriate. But the main thing in the Matrix is a multi-layered and philosophical plot... people still find nuances and details that boggle the imagination.What we got now.. is... AntiMatrix, this is a pathetic parasite on a cult item. I am doubly sorry that one of the original authors had a hand in this. Although, now it is obvious that, she does not know how, and the Matrix has become a cult as a result of the work of a team of talented people, in which Wachowski was only one of.. and, apparently, far from the most important. Not a single element in this cinematic never surpass the original and both sequels. Even everything that was copied-and-pasted looks worse than the original.Perhaps I am wrong, and time will tell, but... for now, I give this film 1 point, only because it, for a while, gave me hope, even if it did not come true. Everyone has their own opinion, but I felt it as if, now a sister, spat in the face of all the fans.",1
1722,"I thought this would be a bomb 💣That being said outside the first 30 minutes being a bit too long (the point at which Mr Anderson begins to accept that his dissociative episodes are not the result of burn out but the subliminal knowledge that he's John Wick stuck in the Matrix and somehow alive)There are excellent parodies of the trilogy, or joke references mocking the fact that the movie the audience is viewing was ordered by parent company Warner Brothers, lack of ingenuity and creativity with trying to reboot or revive old franchises.A basic roast of the Industry as a whole, lack of originality, and reboots, recycled ideas.However the last hour on the sci-fi aspects of the construct being presented to me exploded my brain and I had to make sure that unlike the original Matrix, the updated Matrix was more effective and functional based on purely fictional ideas- not coded programming.The MATRIX is no longer a composition of Mathematical precision with the occasional anomaly known as ""The One"" resulting for the need of the batteries to be presented with a choice.How does this new updated MATRIX function?By keeping ""Adam and Eve"" aka Neo and Trinity at the center of the Matrix Power source where they are physically close but yet mentally so far, like neighbors in a NYC apartment building.Fear plus the desire to want what you can't have according to Neil Patrick Harris aka ""the analyst"" a replacement for the ""Architect"" claims that the emotional struggle generates significantly more energy output per human battery. But requires NEO and TRINITY to be plugged into the center at all times.(I'm assuming that fear and desire for what you can't have can't be coded and has to come literally from the soul mate bond of Neo and Trinity hence the machines cloning or resurrecting those characters and stored in a secure location- that is the only way the existence of this Matrix combined with resurrecting Neo and Trinity are necessary).If you were a fan of ""Reloaded"" like myself there is a hysterical cameo of the Merovingian as a homeless person.. ranting about the lack of class and civilization ruined by a plethora of French and English social networks and mocking texting and emails over interpersonal interaction.In Revolutions I was exhausted by all the loud Zion /Sentinal battle which I found to be time filler.This is literally the first film I was entertained by since COVID and HBO MAX started premiership of movies with ""Blunder Woman 84""Literally this is the first Premiere on HBOMAX I enjoyed.",7
1723,Started off on interesting enough grounds. Was hoping this movie would make up for the so so 2nd and 3rd movies. Lost interest before halfway. Disappointing.,2
1724,So bad I switched it off and watched John Wick to try get some respect back for keanu reeves and to try save my night on my own in front of the tv whilst the wife is out. Really bad. Don't watch if u like the original movies. This movie screams of the 'new age' and is so unbelievably cheesy it should be served at the palace with some port!I was really looking forward to watching this as well. Really disappointed.,1
1725,Understand the bad reviews that came out so quick. Bad reviewing movies is a business in itself. Perfect proof right here ladies and gentlemen. If this movie was the first Matrix it would if gotten and 8.7 as well.,10
1726,"Some cool Matrix-style visuals, some cool Matrix-style fighting, and lots of nostalgic moments, but way too long and based on weak retconned sci-fi. Also bad makeup to age Jada Pinkett - not to mention her overacting :-(",6
1727,Not even good for nostalgia. Made for little girls. They just say things without logic. And worst of all - no proper strong greater good motivation to move the plot forward.They just do stuff because............ They have purple small hair?! I guess.,3
1728,"No plot, endless mindless fighting, could not have been worse. Give this a miss. The writers forgot the Matrix idea and were focused on endless fight scenes, basically a money grab for all involved.",1
1729,"Based on reveiws I came in expecting little. What i got was nothing at all.In order to sit through the whole movie I took multiple breaks and all along I wanted to pick up my phone and play a game as it was so boring.The story is on par with what you would find on YouTube as a fanfic/parody. There was multiple attempts to create tension, but it totaly failed and you end up watching with a care at all what's going to happen.",1
1730,"Is the director so damn desperate for money that she had a complete TIA or amnesia of what she is directing of this film? There is nothing new, interesting, or exciting. The character development is weaker than the third installment of the original trilogy. I thought it was hilarious how machines are fighting amongst each other....does this idea sound new to you or is this like a film we have seen before from the 80's? I enjoyed the very first film very much because of the strong story line, cinematography, and action sequences. The second was not as good as the first but still held the same, but the story was slightly weaker. The third installment was just awful as if the directors ran out of ideas for strong actors to have good lines and the action sequences were just silliness. I do not understand why the person who plays Morpheus is NOT played by the original actor. The person who is playing as Morpheus in this film needs to go back to drama school or should have asked many questions from the actor who played the real Morpheus. I truly do not know how this was approved for production and whoever wrote this needs to have better ideas by thinking more ""outside"" of the box. I do not understand why they made Neo weak in this film. I understand he is trying to find himself, but he did this in the very first film, so this story has already been told. He knows who he is. The only character i enjoyed the most is psychiatrist played by Neil Patrick Harris. He was great and an excellent actor. The love story is already been told between Trinity and Neo. It was laid on very thick in all three films. Also I am not understanding how and why in there are new sentient robots who are good and programmed for the humans when this was not done before. This was a complete waste of time. I do not see this making another trilogy due to poor box office results.",3
1731,"Matrix 1 was amazing it made you think. What was good about that it took the time to build and help you understand the story. Matrix 2 was ok but far from the first. Then came Matrix 3 and it was really a confusing mess. It's like the Wachowskis like to make movies for themselves. I don't see the point of making a mess of a movie that nobody can figure out.Then comes this Matrix which is a bigger mess than 2 and 3. Not only that a big part of it is playing on the self awareness card. But it's not self awareness it's just mocking the first Matrix.This Neo is a tired old guy, Morphieous is pretty weak in here and it's seems like Trinity is the one now. Frankly I don't understand how did the Wachowskis managed to make such a movie like Matrix 1.I gave it 5 only for good ol times. I don't see how they make it better with this direction. I hope they don't do Matrix 5 and ruin it's legacy further.",5
1732,This movie is a joke! WTF is that meta Warner bros BS at the beginning? There's no plot at all. Characters are wasted in utterly nonsense BS flashbacks. Don't watch this movie. Just watch the first one.,1
1733,Big disappointment after 20 years. It was a movie full of nonsense independent of the first three languages. This shouldn't be the movie I've been waiting for 20 years.,3
1734,"I very much looked forward to watching this movie, still remember how stunning it was watching The Matrix back in 1999 on my Windows 98 PC 14"" screen. Unfortunately, The Matrix Resurrection is a big disappointment from every aspect, action scenes, storyline, performance and casting.. Hugo Weaving was smart enough for having refused playing Agent Smith. They just wanted to resurrect it but they did quite the opposite! Action scenes are nothing compared to the Matrix 1 or even 2 or 3 .. they didn't capitalize on the 2021 technology to boost action .. the plot is extremely predictable and boring, I believe that this movie was just made for commercial reasons and whoever participated in it was not loyal enough to the Matrix legacy including Reeves himself!",2
1735,"That could be me with this review, or the wobbly storyline of this Resurrections episode.I could have seen at least one better way to get this written differently, as in relying on human cloning and having once again a real Matrix scenario ready.No way. The writer had chosen the path of transforming the whole story into a circus of irony, which honestly doesn't work at all.Too bad, and it's not just a matter of expectations a fan of that s franchise might see not being met.It's just that a personal manifesto from a director/writer never works for movies. Ever.",3
1736,"Would have been better to not have seen it at all; not even good enough for a TV story, GCI etc.....................................................and so on. You can't go back I guess.",1
1737,"Honestly I don't know where to start.This movie was so bad I can't believe it was made by the same directors. I was laughing so much how ridiculous and cheep they turn the Matrix into a boring flashback movie.Older Neo and Trinity are playing very unconvincingly, they are tired of saying their flat lines and like the audience don't really know what the f is going on. The movie is extremely slow and the fights scene poorly executed, and like everything else in the film, trying to reproduce the ones of the trilogy (but poorly).The main characters of the red pill crew come from different franchises like : The gardians of the galaxy, Pirates of the Caribbean, Friends and Wall-e (you will understand after seeing it).Don't waste your money, wait a month to see it on Netflix.",1
1738,"You know when you have been out all night and drink WAAAYYY too much. Then you start to vomit, forcefully. So hard in fact that your eyes feel like they are going to pop out of your head, the you start instinctively crying while still vomiting. Then when there is nothing left in your stomach you dry heave and fart at the same time.This is what the Matrix Resurrections feels like it is doing to my soul.",4
1739,"Besides all the visual effects, action and so on, what made the original matrix (part 1) so great, was its in depth story line. It introduced concepts of truth to the world within a sci-fi movie. It introduced us concepts like:obliviousness, subconscious programming, choice and free will, believing in yourself, fighting with your ego (agent smith) and many more.The matrix part 2 and 3 also introduced great concepts (which unfortunately got a lit bit sidetracked due to the over extend of action/effects) like ""cause/effect"" - breaking free from the lower nature, and so on...but in this movie, there was no depth. That's what was lacking the most. This story wasn't interesting.I'm not sure how it has been able to come to this. I really wonder.... still waiting for the answer.As an individual movie, I'd give it a 6. In comparison with the other movies, I'd give it a 4. So that's why I gave it a 5 in the end.",5
1740,"I was really hoping for a Matrix movie as well done as the first Matrix movie. It was not even close. Poor writing or story and the addition of little ""cute"" robots to make it like a Disney movie was just over the top bad.",2
1741,"First time in my life I saw people leaving theatre before the end.All aspects of movie were so underwhelming, from plain generic unmemorable characters, poorly written script to the plot that seemed more like a parody for weak minded and low demanding than a serious movie.If you appreciate legacy which Matrix made 2 decades ago don't make any more sequels.",3
1742,I love matrix but this seems like the whole point of the movie is talking talking about hacking and Reality which i literally cared less about.Maybe for 30 to 40mins i was willing to hear what they say but it keeps moving to an extent where it becomes a boredom to watch.The only characters i was able to keep in mind where neo and trinity and maybe Prometheus (maybe) and sadly other characters were not that important to remember even though they played major roles .I miss the the fights and effects of the previous matrix movies this fight scenes kinda seemed weird i dont think it was an improvement comparing neo and johnwick reflex actions this seemed too daam sluggish and slow fight .,5
1743,"It isn't matrix it's just a joke.Main characters missing, they replace actors.Did you see previous films? It doesn't matter, nothing is like it was... Poor story, poor develop and even poor action.",2
1744,"She's gonna need 3 to bring it home.If we're really lucky she'll give us the Matrix inside the Matrix that reveals/explained how Neo dropped a bunch of drones ""in the real world"" via Matrix 2 &amp; 3.Seriously though? As a viewer?A fan?I wanna meet a God above the traditional stereotypes of Comparing the Architect's strict order to God and the Oracle's counterbalance of the Devil to a harmony in life filled with conflict.Yes... advertising is a black hole. So is that expectation of things when considering the fan perspective.This is a film about Neo and Trinity being resurrected for the screen in a world we've grown up with.We love this world and we love the ideas posed.The only flaw here is the idea it all thrives on was introduced in Matrix 1, and we all wanna question the nature of our reality like Matrix challenges us to... But we wanna question it ""harder"" now. Cause we've mulled the idea over and here we are... still stuck. (smiles coyly.)This was an exceptional film.Everything from script to performance to action to score was wonderful.It only lacks that bump... That mind twist that sends you home crying.That ""Matrix inside a Matrix"" bump with a very personal philosophical approach that wakes a bunch of us up from our intellectual and emotional comas.(Shrugs.)Crap... did I expect too much? (Pauses.)A wonderful film.Can't wait for two more...Still waiting for the final nail in my mental perspective on reality though.Much love.6.",9
1745,"At 53 I suppose i go into most everything with very little expectations. Ive learned to take things at face value. The only thing i remember thinking before watching this 4th installment, was that it was going to have to be a pretty decent movie, to impress me. They had some pretty big shoes to fill, and i kinda already knew it would be near impossible.....so i was very pleasantly surprised at how well they did.As usual, I am not in the majority (it seems) because I ended up liking this movie a lot.The premise made sense. A game programmer struggling and somewhat achieving his sense of reality, as he attempts to live in the real world. The matrix, only being a game he programmed that led him to his break in reality and his memories only delusions. Some reviewers seemed confused or let down by this, but i dont see how the story could of continued any other way.The MESSAGE of the story was VERY relevant to todays world. The truth isnt just hidden, it is trivialized. We are bombarded with info and noise so much so that we dont even know what the truth is. Also, we are so divided and judgmental that we cant seem to work together for a common goal.The acting was on point, the cinematograghy well done, special effects and fight scenes were of todays standards.There were some slower parts of the movie, as it tried to pull everything together, but i didnt mind that. I also appreciated the touch of humor.Take this movie as is. At face value, without comparing oror expecting....and just enjoy the ride.",8
1746,"Blinking of actors is a Morse code, a subliminal message from the Matrix 5. Easily sequel of the Cloud Atlas. Ashton Kutcher missed as the Agent Smith's brother. Agent Ashton.Barney Stinson finally lives up to play a villain in a Hollywood blockbuster movie.Pigeon Sentinel is a most original, inovative creation from the FX studio. My heart melted.What happened to Morpheus by the way? Liked that guy.Threat Level Midnight quality.Personally 10/10.Welcome to the crib.It's so beautiful.",1
1747,"Ok so I'm a huge fan of the first film, I liked Reloaded and didn't like Revolutions. Simple.To be honest, I will enjoying this sequel or reboot or whatever you'd call it. Sure it was not as good as the original but it had some good stuff in it and I was really invested in it throughout. The idea of keeping ""The One"" in check like that was a nice idea.The last 10 minutes completely ruined it for me because no, Neo is not ""The One"". Trinity now also has the same powers. In fact she has MORE powers than Neo because ya know we just can't have a white male protagonist being more skilled than his female counterpart can we. Oh no, she has to be superior. I'm surprised Trinity didn't change her skin colour, declare herself a trans, call Neo out on his toxic masculinity and elope with the blue haired character.Woke trash. Shame on you Lana Wachowski. I just can't wait to see Indiana Jones completely ruined next year because it is coming.",3
1748,Please help. I need to unwatch this movie immediately and forget this ever existed.I'm also open and willing to pay for such service if the price seems reasonable.,3
1749,"I have the first three Matrix movies on Blu Ray. Even if someone gave me a copy of this movie for free I'd be more likely to use it as a coaster for my coffee mug than watch it again.This Matrix movie is nothing but a string of exposition constantly explaining what is going on and why a trilogy that had ended, actually hadn't.A waste of time.",3
1750,"Other reviewers:What do you expect ? It's been 20 years the world has changed so why on earth would you expect the 4th movie of a franchise to stay the same or expect them to completely ignore the star power cos they got old ?Heavy spoilers here :I'm not the smarted person but even i followed what was laid down here,Neo and trinity were resurrected by a new 'overlord' programme for it's own agenda, as the oracle and architect aren't around.Which would be fine if nph wasn't so annoying in his i like the sound of my own voice mantra. Because holy jeez he monologues worse than jeffery dean morgan as negan. Like dude we get it you're the new big bad here but for the love of pete shut up !This new character known as the 'analyst' pretends to be neo's therapist but it's really just a form of control. Which is the main theme of this 4th movie,neo and trinity resurrection is a new matrix power source based on 'emotion' a rather dark example of emotional abuse' they more they handle the more tragic their digital lives become, with 'npc's added in adnausiem to control the narratives. To ensure either party is under the sway of the matrix and never come too close to the truth.That is untill one of neo's 'experiments' bears fruit. It's not fully explained in this movie how or why beyond neo had a feeling about his knighmares/ dreams weren't just that, and so this reveals morphieus is alive. But different, he's no longer a red pill but an agent/ redpill hybrid some how morph's code was kept alive after the 'matrix online' death to the assassin, and neo's 'breadcrumb' caused him to wake up.Abdul who plays new morph nails it, both in the voice, style, demeanor and poise.For those expecting neo to burst out and fly around will be dissapointed til the closing act, becauise his 'return is a slow burn.I took two stars off because:The action sometimes is just a blurr of limbs and sparks and it's hard to even comprehend what is actualling happening . Untill it's over.Over all some good one liners call backs and a nice tidy ending, true fans will enjoy it.",8
1751,Firstly a huge fan of trilogy which has now been defiled by this mess. I just want to know who was smoking what at the WB studio when they A) even agreed this should be a feasible idea and B) let that script get a pass. Acting was abysmal throughout and Reeves should really call it a day. Only one worth watching was Carrie Anne Moss what a disaster save yourself the 2 and a half hours which would be spent better watching paint dry.Truly terrible.,1
1752,"The tricky part with sequels, remakes and reboots is the concept of catching lightning in a bottle twice, The Matrix was an inventive and generation defying movie, but its sequels proved to be soulless, empty, and boring.This entry is at least better than those sequels, Neil Patrick Harris shines as ""The Analyst"", the new engineer that found a power source capable of re-writing The Matrix. And kudos to Jessica Henwick for her amazing portrayal of Bugs, a new crew captain that is ready to believe in prophecies.Both Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss shine as Neo and Trinity again, but this story is a bit convoluted, slow paced, and the story takes a long time to start, the red pill takes a while to make effect this time around.I am not overjoyed by the movie, but it was innovating enough to capture me and make me follow the white rabbit once again.",8
1753,"Ok ok ok I know many of you are criticizing this movie and it is clear that you expect more, but comoooon the actors are not young anymore nor the director! They are not the ones that were 20 years ago but they did an outstanding job. This movie isn't as good and as strong as matrix 1 but it felt very good it reminded me how the matrix1,2,3 tasted when I first watched them. It was like hoping to see your old love/ex and now after 20 years there she is! She is not as perfect as she was in her twenties, but she is still your love and seeing her again, feels nice and beautiful. I deeply love the matrix movies and I thank Wachowski for renovating this feeling for me. As I mentioned it felt very fancy to meet the old love again no matter if she is old or not as beautiful as she was years ago...",10
1754,"Honest and bare review.Do you need to be a fan of The Matrix sage (1, 2 and 3) to enjoy this 4th installment? No.Will it help? Yes indeed it does.This movie by Lana Wachowski (only one of the two sisters) delivers on every punch. The story carries itself very well and continues the love arc between the two main characters Neo (played by the one and only Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (played by Carrie-Anne Moss). Watching these two characters on the big screen is surreal given their unique love story. Whenever those two are on screen you can feel the magic palpitating between them - it's just so nice to witness. The rest of the supporting cast play a critical role in enticing the audience to the richness of the story. Yahya Abdul-Mateen as young Morpheus is a gentle touch, while watch the new comer Jonathan Groff as Agent Smith is both exciting and fresh.For me this movie definitely delivered on what was promised with just enough comic relief moments and insane action scene to keep you engaged the whole way through. The movie is nearly 2.5 hours long but I found myself stuck to the screen and not once had to check the time.I don't understand why some are giving this latest and 4th part a hard time. This is a movie guys and is meant to be enjoyed and not criticising every minute of it. This movie is about the unspeakable and elusive love that we as humans all yearn and long for. That what Neo is ultimately aiming for but this time the choice is not up to him but rather resides with Trinity to make it for the both of them; talk about a nice twist from the first trilogy films.For me this movie is a solid 8/10 and a great watch and continuation to The Matrix franchise. However due to the undue negative reviews by others I think it is only fair to score this movie 10/10.Thank you The Wachowski sisters (returning director Lana W.) for bringing this version to life and look forward to (hopefully!) the next 5th installment. :D@HaniJossi.",10
1755,Quit watching at 22nd min of that boring sequence of scenes that are weak copy of 1st Matrix. And according to other's reviews it was wise idea. In 2021 when there's a lot of opportunities to make amazing movie they made one that is more like home movie that is shoot on the cell phone.,1
1756,So disappointed!!!! A horrible plot that tries to recapture the magic of the first Matrix and make you relive it. Seriously one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. Why is Smith calling Neo Tom now?,2
1757,"I've watched all of the Matrix movies. They were more than great. This one... literally seemed like it was a parody of the original ones. It played like a long B rated movie, complete with poor acting and weak fighting scenes throughout. I really thought the good parts were going to start eventually, and assumed what I was watching was a joke or something. There were no good parts, except that we watched it for free via HBO Max! I would rate it a three, but out of respect for the franchise, I gave it a four; barely.",4
1758,"I was really drawn into the original Matrix and saw it many times in the theater. The second and third, not so much, but I did see them. Can't remember much detail about them except the very ending, which resolved the saga satisfactorily.So when this was announced, my immediate thought was ""cash grab."" What on earth could they plan to tell, that would advance the Matrix story, without invalidating the things that came before? I would have been more interested in a new Matrix story if it did *not* have Reeves and Moss...a story which was clearly the ""next chapter"" in the saga. But a Matrix story without Reeves and Moss wouldn't earn as much money, I'm sure.But I watched it. And I wasn't impressed. These specific reasons:1. ""Bugs"" - voice was too slushy or mumbly. Couldn't understand most of what she said, even with the volume turned way up.2. Fight scenes - these were somewhat groundbreaking in the first movie but here it's just more of the same-old. Maybe there's nothing more to explore in this arena.3. Neil Patrick Harris looked like he was wearing a 2,000-year-old Kryten spare head at first, but as the movie went on, his face became a more realistic human face for someone the actor's actual age.4. Was upset by the lack of Fishburne inclusion. Yes, they addressed it, but.5. Way too many clips recycled from the earlier trilogy. Like they needed something interesting on set, so they just cheaped out and reran certain scenes in the background instead of actively coming up with something interesting and new to look at.6. Reeves totally acted like he was phoning it in. I know he has a reputation as somewhat ""wooden,"" but this is rarely something I think about while watching him. Yet by the 25-minute mark I'd commented that he was acting really poorly (which he was) and he continued to be this stilted all throughout the movie. It's almost as if he thought ""Hey, everybody knows Neo, I don't have to do anything special to portray him."" Every word fell out of his mouth like a brick onto asphalt.7. But worst: the story! The story makes no sense at all. Characters act in ways that don't make sense. Primarily what I found annoying is that Neo is willing to put a whole lot of people in danger just to rescue Trinity. This goes against all human ethics we've been taught.Overall this had a sort of ""filler"" flavor, as if it was the center part of some other movie. Production values were good enough to be a Matrix movie, but it fell flat in all these other areas. Perhaps Lilly Wachowski had the right idea after all.",5
1759,"Its been tough enough with how originality has been dying over the last 10+ years, and the stale, stagnating supply of comics, books, movies, tv shows, video games and everything has been down right abysmal in its lack of quality all around. But for a franchise to literally wait the better part of 20 years just to catch up with modern times to make a story more impactful or ""meta""....was a bad idea. The wachowskis have been all over the place since they made the first trilogy, later making the hugely sensational V For Vendetta and the pitiful Jupiter Ascending. But now, when people are practically living within the veritable :""matrix"" system of control itself, with no end in sight and only escalating conformity, government rule and big mega corp ownership of more and more of everything...alonig comes a reminder for the end year season of how terrible things are. I am sure people have seen the trailers, and at this point, if you havnt...""SPOILER ALERT WITHHELD"" so tough it out. NEO is still alive and living in what some would consider a great life, but oohh its soooo hollow...he is successful and has money but never went out of his way to try and do anything, so its a near ""Scrooge"" level tale of success without meaning. Long story short it all plays out almost EXACTLY like the first film, as if rehashing to such an overplayed extent is really what people want. We have memories, we know how it went. IT is just lost upon those too young or whom somehow had their heads in the sand and never experienced the original trilogy in its heyday or thereafter. THey didnt bother bringing back familiar faces like Lawrence Fishbourne or even Hugo Weaving, and though MOrpheas is dead in the film, Agent SMith can JUST BE REMADE the way he was. ITs pathetic all around, it drags ya down, and the only thing thats kinda cool is just zoning out and being reminded of the original films during most scenes. ITs just one recall after another. SOmebody call Arnold Schwarzenegger ffs. Watch with a LIBERAL spritzing of your favorite libation or whatever your indulgence is. This pulled oto many punches and still never made it to the final round in a satisfactory way. 5/10 at BEST, and thats being generous. Way too predictable too...oof.",5
1760,I find it hard it hard to believe Reeves would tarnish his acting reputation with this garbage. Just bad no other way to describe it. The whole story is disjointed and bears no relevance to the real story. The acting and special effects are rank average.,1
1761,The Wachowksi whatevers overdosed on the blue pill after their initial success in the first Matrix. This was reboot trash and the only thing helping me get through it was Keanu Reeves. I fell asleep watching it 3 times and had to restart where I left off.,3
1762,"No introduction, we're just gonna rip into this offense to cinema:The first act digs itself deeply into its own rear end, with Warner Brother's inserting itself as well, like it has been doing quite a lot with its old IP's lately. The dialogue is quite an eye roller, plagued with lazy, meta quips. If I may digress briefly, the already overused Jefferson Airplane song, White Rabbit, which accompanied a terribly on-the-nose montage, made my eyes roll into the back of my head during my first viewing of this film, rendering my memory of it virtually nill, like a traumatic twinge, like a heinous crime I refused to witness. For my second viewing, I really wanted to give Resurrections a chance. I watched the original trilogy to reacquaint myself with the lore and build some hype, but instead of being blessed with boredom as I was initially, my preparation left me cripplingly irritated. I moaned and groaned throughout the first hour. Let me be very clear: the first act is so far up its own pooper that I ponder the first thing it saw: its own decaying teeth or the back of its eyes, and whatever parodoxical, supercilious singularity that would entail. Let's look at some examples: Among the worst dialogue in this film was the line ""We probably just got swatted by some 14 year old."" To this, I can hardly conjure a shake if the head. How jaded has Lana Wachowski become? Watching this film, listening to all the tired, self-justifying dialogue, it becomes clear that Lana wasn't merely hesitant to make this film, agonizing over the challenge of following up on a universally beloved franchise. No. It's agonizingly clear that she never wanted to make this movie at all. ""Warner Brothers wants a sequel"" is certainly an autobiographical line.I can't stand how far gone this movie is from its roots: Seeing Keanu Reaves receive a text message with that awful, immersion wrecking text-bubble overlay that contemporary films so often utilize (just a pet peeve, but still); listening to non-Lawrence Fishburne Morpheus use the term ""callback""; seeing Neo in a cliché substance abuse scene following a therapy session with Neil Patrick Harris (I've got nothing against the man, but Neil Latrick Harris, really?); hearing the line ""Nobody can be told what the Matrix is, blah blah blah"" (phony Fishburne actually says ""blah blah blah""); listening to Neil Patrick Harris talk about his black cat who's name is literally DEJA VU; these things make me wonder when and why the creators of this film took the blue pill.Some more problems I had: Morpheus' reincarnation feels awfully forced; the idea of replacing the iconic, body-snatching Agents with ""the swarm"" takes half the fun out of them and feels cheap, like a compromise rather than a reimagination; I would've preferred a fully cgi Hugo Weaving, if I'm being honest, and it pains me to say that, but his replacement just isn't menacing or convincing; the recreated scene of Neo breaking out of his pod is somehow, 20 years later, a significant visual downgrade. In fact, the entirety of the machine infested real world looks signifcantly brighter, more colorful, and less grim, which is just dispicable, like I'm watching the Joss Whedon cut of The Matrix; everything self-referential falls terribly flat for me and is rarely necessary; the editing, especially in the action sequences, is choppy and undermines the quality of the principal photography; the Eastern Philosophy that made the original trilogy so great is tragically garbled on the rare occasion it's present. At times, it's even antithetical.These are just a few of my least favorite things.Of course, Resurrections isn't all bad. There is a story, and it gets told. I know what the story was, even if I thought it was pretty boring. There are a few things I genuinely enjoyed, too, following that grueling slog of a first act: The way that agents and other synthetic life are brought into the real world is fun and visually appealing, although not terribly original; the concept of ""retroconverting"" digital code from the matrix into DNA sequences is genuinely imaginitive while also staying true to the reality of this fictional world, and I truly delight in imaginative and realistic sci-fi concepts, as rare as they can be; the theme of being unable to live up to your previous accomplishments is genuine, and this feeling that the director tried to convey in the first act is eventually expounded in a palatable way.However, I am sorry to say that this title does not live up to its predecessors in any way, at all. I think that the main issues holding this film back are the lack of any real conflict with the machines, the flacid antagonist, and the incredibly lengthy and deliberately tedious first act. This just doesn't have any of the magic that the original trilogy had, the magic that keeps bringing me back, and I'm disappointed by this underwhelming continuation of a film series that lies near and dear to my heart. Resurrections is one of those sequels that are best forgotten, for the sake of the series as a whole.",4
1763,This guys didn't even created this movie bad .... But they even ruined Matrix trilogy .. we didn't needed sequel.. movie was like high budget money heist theme ... Man it's worst that's all I'm saying .... Still enjoyed it.,1
1764,After recently re-watching the matrix trilogy I was excited for this that exicitment stopped around the 20 minute mark of this film where I realised it wasn't intentionally mocking the original trilogy. It honestly felt at points the Wayne's bros were making this. The best part of this film are the moments where they show clips from the first 3 films in some kind of attempt to remind the viewers who they must think are so thick they wouldn't get it.To sum this film up NEO does not hold a gun keanu reeves the man from the first 3 films and John wick does not hold a single firearm in the entire film.,2
1765,"It is clear that neither keanu nor lana wanted to this this movie and the result is far below expectations or what could have been a masterpiece of the decade. Warner should have taken care of matrix legacy before releasing this ""official"" cut.If you are a fan of Matrix and though this would be mind-blowing as of the original this is surely the disappointment and indeed will never again be accomplished.But if you want a fresh restart of a new saga (hopefully) this could become something big in a new trilogy. Just need warner to take care of plot, director, actors, special effects and edition (basically evertyhing!)",7
1766,"Wow, this is not only a terrible movie, but also a rip off of the first one in far too many scenes, and for NO good reason at all. It's like watching a parody remake, instead of a follow up. There is no purpose to this film, and how it received any funding or people willing to work on it at all is beyond me. The script is crap and the execution is worse. There is no quality here. I have nothing good to say about it.",1
1767,"Yeah I get it, actors aged, storyline a bit weird etc. None of this matters, this is the Matrix guys! I loved the plot and the very subtle twist at the very end. And outstanding acting from the whole cast, and more than exceptional acting from Keanu Reeves (Neo), Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), Jessica Henwick (Bugs) and Jonathan Groff (Smith). And don´t complain about the script. Everything in life is about Ones and Zeros. And life is also about living your life and dreaming about an alternate version of your life. Was just great to see almost all the actors and actresses back from 18 years ago. Even Sati... Just like in the movie, go for the red pill. Get out of your comfort zone.",8
1768,"This movie without a doubt would win the prize for worst movie of the year and the most disappointing movie of the year, boring , not entertaining. When you watch the action scenes of matrix 1 and reloaded you are mind blowned, but the action scenes here are pure trash like TV show action, total disappointment. Forget the matrix this is pure garbage.",1
1769,"What a let down this movie is, its just awful, is boring, uninteresting, not entertaining, the action is forgettable not as in the previous entries where the action is mind blowing specially in reloaded, what a poop fest this movie is , in one word : THE WORST.This movie earns the title of the most dissapointing movie of the year without a doubt.",1
1770,A trilogy is a trilogy for a reason. The magic is gone and it is merely building on the success it's predecessors had.. you can watch but beware of disappointment.. 5 stars out of ten..,5
1771,"I have to admit, I didn't watch the movie until the end.I gave up after 1 hour sharp. Thought to give it a chance, but then I ran out of patience.No idea where this movie is heading too (do they actually know if Reeves himself says you need to watch it at least 3 times ?), and 20 years ago this looked cool but now ... now it's just a waste of time.",1
1772,Story is okay. But they forgot about action.Even Matrix became generic popcorn movie these days. Nothing to remember. Nothing new. Nothing fresh. If you're fan of the franchise you should see it 'cause there is hope universe will be extended and someday something good maybe came out of it. If you didn't saw the original trilogy - nothing for you here.,6
1773,"Pretty sure the notion this movie should have never been made has already been used one to two million times, so I'd refrain from using it. There are certain doubts I have about why exactly was this movie made but I'll just settle down with the most two obvious: money and therapy. It's been 20 years, as we are reminded often enough in the movie itself and our protagonists should have been long dead, as we are reminded often enough in the movie itself. Yet, here's the popular Hollywood card you just can't afford not to play these days. Resurrection of dead franchises and adapting them to whatever current generation of opinionated twentysomethings is labeled. So no surprises here.Considering all endeavors of ex-brothers-now-sisters-one-trick-ponies in the last 10 years were catastrophic flops, it was only natural to try your one trick once more. Knowing you are 20 years older and that one trick is, too. Well, results are exactly what you'd expect in such scenario.",1
1774,I waited a few days before writing my review. To let it sink in. To see if I was being dramatic. To see if I would change my opinion upon reflection.My opinion hasn't changed.It is heartbreakingly terrible.,1
1775,"Not enough serious fighting scenes(what can we expect from women),to many time spent on searching Trinity,to many time female roles are talking,thinking. Poorly executed CGI in bike chase,people jumping from the buildings, too many cringey humor..Only thing worth this movie was few of old casting actors back together on the screen.",4
1776,"When they first announced a new Matrix film I was really excited and who wouldn't have been? It had a brilliant story that opened up many philosophical discussions and mind-blowing set pieces. After watching the first one, I remember leaving the cinema asking myself ""How did they do that"". 22yrs later I wondered ""Why did they make it?""Aside from the opening sequence, which was amazing and got me pumped for the next 2 1/2hrs, there was no memorable set pieces (and two days after seeing the film, I still can't think of any). Having made the John Wick, I was really hoping/expecting some OTT/brutal action sequences. Sadly this never happens and we get Jedi Master Neo instead.While I got the premise of the déjà vu within the film, I thought it was overused to the point where it felt more like nostalgic lip-service to the original trilogy than plot development. They even covered Rage Against the Machine's 'Wake Up' in the closing credits, which sums it all up really.Sadly, this was a film that didn't need to be a made and if you want to watch the film, I'd recommend watching the first one again instead.",4
1777,Not a movie but a spit in the face of the matrix fans. Shame on you. It's some kind of mock. Wachowski please stop shooting .3 stars only for Keanu Reeves.,3
1778,"Wow, underwhelmed is an under statement. We didn't ask for it, but have delivered a film that has moments, but is ultimately another overdose of nostalgia for an original already ruined by two woeful sequels years ago.The idea is a long shot and tenuous links to the original movie are the core to the story.The script is poor and dialogue that will leave you shaking your head in disbelief.Please, please stop, no more unnecessary sequels.",4
1779,"There are no words to describe how this movie wounded me beyond reckoning.All the hard work that went into following the original film and expanding into a brilliant universe (including Animatrix and Enter The Matrix) came crashing down and cast off to the wind.The russian doll scheme masquerading as insight is only as half-repulsive as the juvenile dialogue and direction this movie took.Any immersion you may have will be destroyed in record timing.And to blend it with actual scenes (take note, from *actual* movies) was a sin that cannot be taken back.The sad truths about this movie, ironically enough, you can hear them throughout, which saves me a few words. Sadder still that they were presumably on purpose.Oh Lana.. if you don't take movies seriously, don't make it so the rest of us have to follow in your shallow standards of creativity.I'm speechless really.. but most of all, I feel depressed and betrayed.Thank you.PS: The 3 stars are for soundtrack and for actually making me believe I'm stuck in a nightmarish simulation. If only that was on purpose.Maybe you should've been a musician instead.",3
1780,"The Matrix trilogy was once more than just a cult and box-office film. It has become a cultural event, seriously discussed by modern philosophers. 'The Matrix' filmed philosophy itself, one of them claimed (Baudrillard, perhaps)What do we see now?A few good self-ironic jokes - as if the author winks at the viewer, 'no, I understand that, not quite a fool, but he himself is deep in the f...matrix, that's how it should be'. If Wachowski had developed this theme, perhaps the film would have become, if not a logical continuation, then at least a separate interesting project, but, alas. It seems that they were very lazy (if the film was made under pressure from the studio, then this can be understood) and this is read in everything - an indistinct soundtrack, uninteresting action, ridiculous empty scenes and the same ridiculous supporting characters.A considerable part of the film feels embarrassing for the cheapness, untimeliness and infantilism of what is happening. The 'flashback' scenes from the previous installments only underline this. Whether this was done intentionally by the director, as another spit in the direction of the studio bosses, or not, we are unlikely to know for sure. One thing is alarming - the Wachowskis did not remove anything interesting after that trilogy. Even when filming, having received all the trump cards, it turned out something like a little book stuffed with platitudes.One thing is good - the trilogy is no longer spoiled.",4
1781,An insult to the audience. An insult to the audience. Worst movie. Super bad dont watch keep the good vibes of the previous movies. An insult to the audience.,1
1782,"It started of well with the whole Surreal reality thing and the concept that the previous trilogy was a game. You can also tell that there's alot of money has gone into it, But that's about it. Everything else was a disaster.",6
1783,Now as much as I love the original matrix films and how much I anticipated this movie it was very dissapointing. They should've left the originals alone.in order for it to be good you have to forget neo is the chosen one and you have to have got a good night sleep to finish it. Just imagine the original matrix but if it was a soft movie.,4
1784,"I would have given the trailer 8 out of 10 if i could but sadly the movie wasn't as interesting as the advertising used to sell it. This saddens me greatly because i was hoping they could make something at least half as good as the first one after all these years but i guess not. That's the movie industry though, spending billions to achieve mediocrity. Keep shooting for the middle.",4
1785,I watched it and it was total Garbage. Waist of money. If you want to watch it just wait until goes on Tv for free then watch it don't waist your money on this Garbage.,1
1786,"Slow, boring, grasping for air by constant playbacks (PLAYBACKS!!!)of scenes from the original movies. The storyline crumbles and breaks within the first 15 minutes. There is absolutly no sense in the plot what so ever. Whey did they do this?Neo is just old and slow. He is like a John Wick but worse.Nothing makes sense. Why is Morpheous back and in another shape? He has absolutly no purpose. Morpheous as a character brings nothing to the story. He is, in addition, a worser Morpheous than the old one. No carisma what so ever.The only light in the darkness is Trinity who still is a pretty good character and has stayed in shape to do her part. She still enjoys the occasional ""Trinity-kicks"" and is sharp as ever in her dialogue. In contrast to Neo who mumbles and moans and only fighting skill is the ""Jedi-stoping-bullets-move"". Witch is overused in every fight scene!!!!The movie sudenly turns into a zombie apocalypse where zombiefied so called bots throw them selfs like bombs from buildings and on to moving cars trying to kill our heroes.Outrageous!!!This is the first time I have considered leaving the theatre during a movie. But greedy as a Scot I endured. I even wated for the post credit scene...which I of course shouldn't have...the last and worst low mark of this movie. (The Merovingian included).""You hear that Mr. Anderson?... That is the sound of inevitability... It is the sound of your death... Good bye, Mr. Anderson.""",2
1787,"My god this movie is bad lol. They couldn't find Neo hiding in the Matrix for 20 years and guess what he does for a living, he's a famous game developer who made the Matrix trilogy and his name is still Thomas Anderson. Wow..... Super incognito lmfao.",2
1788,"I did not like The Matrix Resurrections. I don't think it added anything to the franchise. This was not an epic love story, as it was billed to be. It didn't even have the sexy, sleek, stylized look when characters entered the Matrix. There were novel and incredibly artistic sequences in the first Matrix that required 360 degree perimeter cameras to get the shot, particularly with the the fight sequences. I don't believe any such techniques were used here. The way that this film was constructed, the sloppiness of its execution was plastered over by the narrative, the ""upgrades"" to the Matrix program, CGI, and the enormity in scope of the numbers involved in the fights that were computer generated onslaughts rather than sophisticated choreographed sequences.Morpheus didn't have much to do with this movie. He was needed for continuity, but narratively, it was an afterthought. The ""new"" Agent Smith, played by Jonathan Groff, was terrible. Both Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving were missed. Neil Patrick Harris . . . Silly. I can't imagine it was only because of the pandemic.I'm not going to recommend that people don't watch it. Of course they are. If one was a fan of the franchise, there is a compulsion, a curiosity, a desire to scratch that itch. Watch it. It wasn't terrrrrible. I have seen worse. For a $150 million budget, however, I don't think the studio got much value. It's not an epic film. It's not a great story. It doesn't have the allegory that the first movie did. It's rather a mindless movie with mediocre sequences, a substandard story, and uninspired effects. It was a disappointment. If Lana Wachowski wanted to resurrect the franchise, there should have been a more compelling story with more compelling filming to go with it. James Cameron didn't release his planned sequels to Avatar (2009) because he needed the technology to realize his vision. While I make no predictions about the quality of his sequels, at least there is a vision associated with their reason and an outlined arc for the narrative. Was the 18-year wait for the Matrix Resurrections worth it? Not that anyone was waiting, but it would be difficult to imagine that anyone could say so.",5
1789,"As much as the Matrix... ""freed our minds"" with a philosophy that's so in ingulfed into pop culture over 20 years later, that it makes this sequel seem like just another movie, The Matrix is also about an advancement of visual effects that blew people's minds.I kinda knew this film would not be able to do that. The special effects on the Matrix Resurrections look no more special than any other movie I've seen in the past 20 somewhat years, so Lana Wachowskis just has to live with the fact that she invented the whole she put herself in (not a bad legacy to have)Snice they could not beat what they did they embraced it. Like how the visual effects were an important story arch to the original movie this also makes the groundbreaking ""Bullet time"" as a major story plot in the picture, and I have to confess that may not have been the best idea because like a ton of movies that followed The Matrix, pointing out the Bullet time effect to exploit it did not really make the movie better.Getting back to the philosophy, it's not groundbreaking, its nostalgic. In that way it's fun. The fourth installment is all too aware of itself and its place in cinema history and it makes fun of it, which made the movie fun.The one part of the philosophy I did love was the upgrade on the fellowship between Neo and Trinity. I remember seeing the first matrix and thinking it was perfect until one of my teachers pointed out a flaw in which Trinity's only purpose in the film was to be in love with Neo, a perfect movie stereotype. I feel like number four has evolved their relationship beyond the common construct of love and I'll be happy to talk about that to anyone who wants to listen (and even those who don't). If Resurrections gave me anything it's that.Keanu Reeves is Keanu Reeves. We all love him and seeing him in anything would be boss. This could have been John Wick four of Bill and Ted four or Speed 3 and we would totally want to see Keanu in it. It was great seeing Carrie Anne Moss as Trinity again totally happy about that and last and certainly great, Jada Pinkett Smith reprises her role from the first round of sequels, and it all works for me. It's the best.Jonathan Groff was an actor who played an old character in a new form, and I liked what he did as that character. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is a great actor playing an old character in a new form and unfortunately for his greatness nobody in the audience is going to say they prefer his version of the character over the originator.Out of the new characters I liked one named Bugs the best, but it's not saying much. I understood the focus on the old characters over the new, but I also feel that the new characters were weak and underdeveloped.My biggest complaint: not enough kung fu in it!I said a lot and I would say more but the interesting thing about talking about the Matrix 4 is that it reveals too much about the movie. It's not going to change your life like the first one. It's like playing an 8-bit game upgraded with 16-bit graphics, but importantly it's still a great movie to watch.So, take the red pill.",6
1790,"Such a disappointing movie, Keanu Reeves acting was just terrible for the most part. To be fair though the movie was full of bad acting and focussed on special effects more than a good storyline.The storyline was just all over the place and didn't make much sense at times and agent Smith referring to Neo as 'Tom' was just the most irritable thing too.Awesome CGI but thats about the only good thing I can say however just way too much of it.Someone else referred to it as cash grab and id have to agree. The Matrix could have been revived in such a good way with a great story but they failed us yet again.",3
1791,"A truly fun and exciting return to the matrix.Everything in the universe evolved and grew in a logical and believable way, I was amazed how lana watchowsky delivered the movie in such a way you would think she directed the last Matrix just a few years ago instead it was 20 years since the first one.What im trying to say is if you are a matrix fan you wont be dissapointed.Supporting characters were suprisingly likable and interesting.Hugo Weiving was missed but the story redemeed his 'absense' in a really interesting way.Dont get too stressed reading some of the dissapointments here in the review and feel guilty about liking Matrix 4, we 90s kids deserved this.Im truly happy this film exists.",10
1792,First - it's a tough act to follow - but they did a pretty good job with this! I enjoyed it! A good follow up and continuation of the story. Only thing it really really really needed - was the real Morpheus and Agent Smith!,9
1793,"This movie was a useless mess. I really don't know why I agreed to see it. Why was this story even needed? Like come on, it's like she threw a bunch of paper on a table, then proceeded to stand on the table and drop a huge dump on it. Slapped a seal of approval on it and called it a movie. Congratulations, you've taken time away from me I will never get back.",1
1794,"LIKES:The Nostalgia:My experience with the Matrix is like many with loads of things that I remember making the movie amazing. Resurrection tries very hard to bring all that to the first installment, providing fan service and references to hopefully distract and please the already high stakes audience. Status of famous moments, classic lines littered in the dialogue, Easter eggs of props, and even classic scenes litter this movie in hopes of pulling you back into the world of computers and deception. At times, there is great awe in what they pulled back into this movie, claps and applause at the details, the shots, and the reliving of the classic movies with modern day graphics to whet the appetite as to what else will be tied into the movie. It's that foundation to an extent that makes for a good sequel, helping to erect a modern twist to the film.The Humor:While not the classiest of the bunch, nor the most unique, Matrix Resurrections gets points for the foresight of being its own critic with the way they did the humor. It jabs at itself and finds a way to bring some meta humor into the mix in hopes of pointing out all the nuances that came with this revival, including poking at the company itself. A bold move and well timed, that irony comedy is a slight plus to the opening manner in the place of this film.The Logic To Some Degree:The movie had a lot of gaps in code to patch through, and to some extent they were able to accomplish this with the story telling. A hybrid of old and new, Resurrections takes the time to explain (what was probably already known) and helps again bridge the past to the present with some decent explanations, some skeletal work, and some promise of the technological adaptation that this series thrives on. It's a logic that is semi-befitting of the Matrix and was the story elements I was hoping to dive more into, but it was a start.The Special Effects:While heavily CGI based at times, the movie did manage to immerse us back into the world of the Matrix. Lots of elements from the old have been updated, with bullet time, over the top stunts, and the classic agent moves coming to life much more effortlessly. Other elements like the real world, the ship designs, and some of the new action holds more of the spectacles and I loved getting the world to unfold again with updated technology. It's the highlight of the movie for me and certainly the biggest draw to the theater for this reviewer if you needed to maximize the experience.DISLIKES:The Villains To An Extent:The first Matrix held a lot of promising villains for Neo to try and work around in his quest for enlightenment and truth. For Resurrections however, the antagonists are a bit meh in my books compared to the design of the old. The new Smith is just not that antagonizing and seems limited to the old form, in both performance and style, feeling like this washed out version that needs another movie to get right. All the big bad machines that once were hunting and lethal, are background noise that did not fit as smoothly into the world and felt sort of forced for the parts we saw. As for the Analyst, there is again promise and he held the most sinister aspects thanks to Neil Patrick Harris, but even he seems a bit downgraded compared to the trilogy's band of elite programs. Even the ""climactic moments"" of this character were limited, a farce of the balance that was once held between the titans of the Matrix.Missing the Philosophical/Complexity:The first three Matrix movies were all about the layers of the movie and how deep the corruption went in the solution for liberation from the confines of the computer. Amidst the chaos of the Sci-Fi story, the movie held philosophical questions and religious references that were integrated but never overtook the story element. The balance was a fantastic, multi-tiered movie, which made you think and added mystery to the movie, further pulling us into deciphering the code and the way the plot would unfold given everything. In this film though... that intrigue and mystery is missing, all the answers laid out for you in a bland manner that is simplistic and mediocre in the new age of this world. Throw in the new approach destroying a lot of the religious context the first film held, and the very foundations that pulled me in further drop to deletion.The Lackluster Characters At Time:Again, we held connections to the crew of the original ship and the real world as they tried to accomplish the missions to break the Matrix and stop the war. The connection to the characters added suspense to the mix and a bit of heartbreak when a character was removed from the lines due to fate's circumstance. Yet in the Matrix Resurrections, that was missing big time for me, replacing the approach with minimalistic characters who gave enough to be remembered, but did not establish the connection to really care if they survived. The disconnection again led to boring moments and a disengagement from the movie as a whole.The Nostalgia Gets too Much:Bringing nostalgia into the mix is a wonderful tactic to reignite the spark, but when you take it too far that it gets in the way of the story, that's when it goes too far. Matrix takes all the retro ideas and blows them to too high of proportions, cramming all the patchy references and fan service to the tale that it severely disrupts the programming of a good story/movie that it could have been. It tried too hard to include too much of the old, and eventually got the point of eye rolling annoyance for me as these things can sometimes get into. To give you an example, there are literally a few moments in the opening acts of the movie that are almost straight up copies of the original, only much less coordinated, complied, or of good quality. That unoriginality and shortcuts are boring to fans like me and was carried too far for my tastes.The Action:You might think that despite all this, there has to be enough action to offset the gaps and limitations to the story, like numbers 2 and 3 right? Nope. Resurrections action is kind of lackluster as well, missing the pizazz, quality, and again suspense that mad ethe first three movies the edgy picture that it once was. Outside of bland characters that are playing the roles, the Matrix 4's action is lowered for a few reasons. First, the action is kind of low key and ill-placed, with most of the moments either poor remakes, or short lived moments that soon get bogged down in conversation. A few moments manage to start hitting the level of the past, primarily a train scene, but this is a rare moment given the nearly 2.5 hours that was quite a shame. Second, the visuals and fight styles are a bit cheesy and simplistic as the movie progresses. Remember the past where we had nail biting moves, close calls, injuries, and uber moments of exploiting the Matrix to pull off killer moves (wall running, sword swinging, dodges with bikes, etc.)? However, this movie is again lacking, taking the promising moments and soon turning them into stale moments of simple pushing and pulling that are lazy and overdone. Third: Much of the action takes place offscreen, or we decide to pan out and have it take place in a wide simplistic shot. The scenes feel uncoordinated and absent and lack the fluidity that we once held, which again was not what the resurrection needed. Finally, the times we do see the fights, they feel artificial, and the editing is very rapid, cut away, and stitched to only further minimize the majesty of the fight. All of it felt low caliber, lost to everything this movie once cherished.The Opening Act:My word was this the worst part of the movie for me. Resurrections is trying to get you into trying to wonder what is going on, but it get diluted into a messy Groundhog's Day approach that lost entertainment and value. It took way too long to get to any remote adventure, was so convoluted in their approach to figure out what they wanted to present and it just failed to be entertaining. No close calls, no mystery, and very sloppy versions of classic scenes did little to give me the balance we once held and had me fighting sleep as I hoped there would be the Matrix magic coming.The VERDICT:Overall, Matrix Resurrections did not revive the movie the way I wanted it to and instead brought it back the way I expected it to happen. There is foundation to work with and potential to make some deeper movies that will explore a lot of concepts if given the right director/writer as the new story tries to find itself. Certainly there are some wow factors in special effects, promising actors, and some logic that bridges the gaps, but they can only do so much given the gaping flaws of the movie. The fourth movie does too much and seems lost in the modern and the old, diluting the quality for the quantity in this attempt to bring back the franchise that had wrapped up nicely. All the things I loved about the Matrix had been reduced to level 1-2 in terms of quality and I was bored for much of the film with no connection. All the action, storytelling, thinking, and quality science fiction that the original trilogy held is sort of gone and I kind of now only care about the story for that amazing game that could be on the horizon. In my opinion, this movie is all about watching at home, and I can't say I would be looking forward to a sequel unless they get back to the roots and reign in the wild west of ideas that this reboot is sort of in right now.My scores for Matrix 4 are:Action/Sci-Fi: 6.0Movie Overall: 5.0.",6
1795,This movie made as much sense as tips on a bull. Looked stupid and made no sense. It was like a horrific car accident. Horrendous to look at yet so visually stunning I had to look at it.,1
1796,"There is nothing good to say about this movie, and I say that fully aware of how embellished a comment that is. Forget about story and history and philosophy and plot-or any of the other hundred things missing or lacking in this film-at least the action scenes are better, right? The fighting? Do we get better fighting?Nope.If it's possible for you to ignore this film was ever made, and go back to believing the first belongs in the pantheon of great cinema, loving the second, and tolerating the third-you should do it. There is no place for this movie in this story. This does not expand the trilogy. It's an abomination.No.Dear god, no.",1
1797,"I saw The Matrix Resurrections, starring Keanu Reeves-the John Wick movies, Constantine; Carrie_Anne Moss-Jessica Jones_tv, Silent Hill:Revelations; Yahya Abdul_Mateen 2-Candyman_2021, Aquaman; Jonathan Groff-Hamilton_2020, Glee_tv and Neil Patrick Harris-Downsizing, Starship Troopers.This is the 4th in the Matrix series and the effects are great but the story is a little disappointing. Keanu and Carrie_Anne return as Neo &amp; Trinity as they try to tell if their world is real or not-Red pill or blue pill? Yahya plays Morpheus and Jonathan is Smith with Neil as a psychiatrist trying to get Keanu on the right path. There are flashbacks to previous installments in the series, which is nice and a few cameos but I had a problem following some of the story-maybe it's just me. There is a scene after the end credits.It's rated R for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 28 minutes.I love the Matrix movies so I would probably buy this one on DVD.",7
1798,"Boring, forced, predictable. Everything that made Matrix unique and beautiful is absent here. The creators tried to give depth and meaning but failed miserably, the action was subpar and had no resemblance to original Matrix action sequences.Literally couldn't find 1 redeeming quality about this movie and it makes me sad and disappointed like I could not have imagined.I wonder how can some people rate this more than 5 stars, this movie is probably a worse ending than that of GoT.Only worth a watch when it comes up on TV for free, probably within a year.",2
1799,"Everything went wrong, what a WASTE of everything.What a lazy slow unnecessary movie, it was hard not to leave the theatre after 1hr30 but i thought : Okay just hang on maybe the end is going to blow your mind and it will just be enough to forget the pure agony that was the first 1hr30 ?Oh boi was i wrong.Everything is just worst than in the trilogy, the cast, the filming, the CGI, the story, the dialogues, where's the passion, where's the creativity ?? GONE.It all have already been seen in the trilogy, and it's not just WINK WINK here's a reference, nope it's a plain CTRL C / CTRL V or even worst some original footage or a combination of both.And when there's finally something new it's just WRONG.They ruined the existing characters by replacing them with some dollar store script / acting, i think the same can be said about everything, it's a dollar store Matrix.That's a B movie that was made to do a quick cash and it'll work, it will make money i have no doubt about it so, congratulations to them i guess.",2
1800,"I kept myself cautiously optimistic about this movie. I left the movie feeling disappointed. The movie trailer made a joke about nostalgia, but I have to wonder if that was the only thing the film was hoping would make it good.First, the special effects really didn't progress much compared to the first 3 movies. If anything, the special effects seemed anemic in most of the scenes. There isn't much more to say about the effects.Second, the fight choreography seemed very light compared to the first 3 movies. There were times when it seemed like the actors were literally pulling their punches. A fair number of fights include remakes of fights from the first 3 movies. I'm not sure about anyone else, but I don't like having to pay to watch a rerun.Third, the story seemed like nothing more than a farewell/happy-ending for Neo and Trinity; but the rest of the world is probably still stuck in the Matrix. Neo and Trinity get to give the finger to the machines, but everyone else is still stuck with no feasible way out. Good job heroes, you saved yourselves! Sure, Neo and Trinity are going to ""remake"" the world, but since the machines literally control the Matrix, they'll just undo the world like hitting Ctrl+Z on the keyboard.Finally, a significant portion of the movie just uses old footage from the original 3 movies. So in a way, instead of using exposition (and ignoring the nostalgia the movie assumed exists but obviously not since it has to replay scenes), the viewing experience is watching reruns.The original 3 movies were good as they were, and they ended fine. Matrix Resurrections was an unnecessary addition to the franchise.",3
1801,"Poor script, poor direction and camera work, in general - cheap. The first episode of The Matrix TV-show from the rookies - 6/10. Movie - 1/10. Sorry.",
1802,"The first Matrix was pretty iconic; from the premise, to the action sequences, to the special effects. But if I'm being honest, I could have done without either of the first two sequels. Having seen the first three films, though, I watched this one almost out of a sense of obligation more so than an actual desire to see it.Turns out my reservations were spot on. This movie was completely unnecessary, in that it did nothing to build off of or enhance the story told in the first three films. The ending of ""Revolutions"" left viewers with a sense of finality that didn't even warrant a fourth film.Not only did ""Resurrections"" fail to add anything to the existing storyline of the franchise; it also totally cheapened the story established up to that point. The first three installments were centered around the idea of Neo being ""The One."" For three movies we came to know Neo as humanity's only and best hope for breaking free of the machines. Now this film comes along and all of a sudden Trinity is apparently also ""The One?"" So now they're ""The Two?"" LAME. And the totally senseless and unnecessary recasting of Morpheus and Agent Smith? Garbage.This movie may have been okay as a stand-alone film for those unfamiliar with the existing trilogy. Unfortunately for those of us who've been around since the beginning, it just comes off as a shameless cash grab from a studio and production team looking to make a quick profit off of today's reboot craze. While it may have revitalized a few careers or given a boost to some just starting out, I'm definitely a little disappointed in Keanu Reeves for making this turd of a film given all his recent success. But I think my biggest beef with this film was the arrogance with which the studio and production team openly advertised what they were doing with the idea of the pointless reboot/sequel, by speaking to it directly in the film using Neo's game as an analogy. While I wish I could have that two and a half hours of my life back, I'm just glad I streamed this dumpster fire from home on HBO Max instead of wasting my hard-earned dollars at the theater.",1
1803,What could go wrong? I mean you have this project with big movie name that is so good in any possible way that it seems like you can't possibly fail. But in todays Hollywood everything is possible. Hollywood where the best ones don't get jobs only swindlers. Miss 90s and early 20s..ehh.,2
1804,"I can't understand why would you take a prefect movie , a legend and ruin it like this !Was making fun of morpheus iconic lines and scenes supposed to be funny !I wish they delete it !",1
1805,"The newest trilogy of Star Wars movies, while progressively bad, I don't think reach the consistent and laughable lows this movie manages to achieve.Like many others, The Matrix I rate as one of the best movie experiences I've had. Reloaded was a step down, but wildly entertaining and a visual spectacle. Revolutions was just kind of, more of the same and didn't really push the envelope, whilst convoluting the story even more-so.With this movie, I could actually vividly see how lazily it was conceived. I actually think that might be the perfect one word description for this movie, lazy. There are constant flashbacks to the previous movies, and blatantly reused ideas and camera shots from the first movie, that kind of tarnished it with how cheap the inclusions felt. When you see those moments, you'll know what I'm talking about.I think a monologue between Neo and his boss towards the beginning of the movie may actually be a sneak peak into how this movie was conceived; nobody actually wanted to make the movie, and it has turned into a cash grab.Shame. I'm going to go watch the trilogy to get this bad taste out of my mouth.",2
1806,This was horrible. I'm shocked Reeves would be a part of this. The people that say it has anything to do with the originals are lying. This was an awful attempt to make sure everyone knows that men don't have to be the heros. If it wouldn't have been for my 12 year old I would have walked out after 30 minutes. This movie made me long for spicy farts so I could think about something else.,1
1807,"I didn't think I would, based on all the negative comments, but I really liked this movie.When I saw the trailers, I was very doubtful. The green tones of the originals were gone, and new faces on established characters. But I think the movie explained the things I had doubts about adequately.I know this franchise didn't need another installment. The story was wrapped up well enough, and the potential for disaster was there. And maybe it's the nostalgia talking, but I am glad they made this one, because it just makes me love the original even more.",10
1808,"The first movie re written with both Neo and Trinity being the one with the same powers. Do not watch, I can't get my time back! Very bitter lol. Do not watch, do not watch, do not watch!",1
1809,"What a terrible pointless movie (actually the only point is to make people pay for watch it) , and that's me being generous.... Your time is precious, don't waste it on this movie.",1
1810,This is a movie that should never have been made. It felt like Lana Wachowski didn't know why people actually liked the original ''The Matrix'' because this movie was obviously lost in translation. It was like a love story/ IT drama.And what was it with bringing the main actors from sense8 into The Matrix? It was so senseless and felt forced. Can a petition be signed to delete this movie completely from all theatres and streaming platforms so we can try to forget it ever existed?,5
1811,"This thing is not unwatchable. It's just that its existence has little point to it. It's much more an odd and kind of boring art movie than a sci-fi action flick with some deep meaning like the first Matrix. It sometimes even turns into its own parody even.One can of course appreciate the acting and the cinematography and of course those who care the return of these two legendary characters Neo and Trinity and the opportunity to watch them get a second chance.Which by the way is not necessarily such a good thing some of us may just liked the somewhat tragic ending and wanted to remember this story that way.Anyhow ultimately this movie is just and oddity, something most of us would watch once, get moderately intrigued and entertained then quickly forget forever.",5
1812,"Holliwood have managed to complete the unfathomable task to ruin yet another great movie franchise which was an actual cult of our generation, after they ruined a whole lot of other old great productions. Horrible scenario, horrible cast of new actors who are complete off-role, humorous finish, disappointing soundtrack that has nothing to do with the original one... I can't think of a single point that I liked about this... thing and I have been a big fan for 20 years now. Only because of this I give a generous four rate but still it is too much for this misunderstanding. If I had directed this sequel, I would have made it much better in times. Tell me, guys from Holliwood, why are you so shallow with ideas and strong sense for responsibility to these great and much awaited franchises? Do hire then teams of real fans next time to consult you properly what the fans would really want and would pay everything to have it, so that you never expose yourselves again! Otherwise so much money down the drain.",4
1813,"A waste of time.An attempted cash grab.Don't watch it if you want to carry on with good memories of the first or even the other two. It'll give you a headache honestly.Oh and don't get mad at Siri, she has feelings too.",2
1814,"1999 matrix along with 1984 terminator were probably my favourite films ever, totally original and real class.I can't believe how bad this film is, I'm really shocked and disappointed.Reloaded and Revolutions we not fantastic films but they were still good and the story flowed from the original.This is a complete mess from start to finish.I was cringing at about 10 minutes in thinking what have they done.I stuck it out to the end but it was really a struggle to stay intetested or even awake it was totally boring.Its basically gone the same way as Arnie in the last few terminator films, cringing laughable mess!",1
1815,"Poor in many ways: acting, effects, dialogue, fights, story, and the trashy music. I managed to get to the end. Nothing like the perfection of the original. A mixed up confusing mess that only kids would enjoy.",4
1816,"Utter garbage. An overload of chases, fights, spray of bullets which is all part of a formula of creating a movie to the people that can't think or appreciate a a movie where things get slowly developed and it reels you in little by little.This is a total waste of time.",3
1817,"Hollywood really can't get out of its own way. I spent the first half hour trying to convince myself that it's not that bad. Sure they had to recreate scenes directly out of the originals for nostalgia, but did they have to actually just cut and paste and overlay actual scenes through out the entire movie? By the time they got to the Writer's Room montage, I was convinced that it was going to be a bad movie. That scene should have stayed in the actual writers room along with many many other terrible choices that made it into the feature. As the film went through the not as bad (not meant to be a compliment) middle part of the movie, my head shakes turned in to audible sigh's. Then ""IT"" happened. I outright laughed as if I were watching stand up comedy. I continued to laughed until the credits were rolling. I still can't believe that ending! I was entertained, but not in they way it was intended.",2
1818,"The whole premise of this movie dishonored the sacrifices made by Neo &amp; Trinity in Revolutions. First, let's talk about the progressive things that they changed from the original trilogy. So now we have holographic flamboyant Morpheus &amp; machines (that look like Pokemon) that joined the human side. No more Zion, only IO - we have clouds now baby! Smith is back, only in a different body. The machines still rule the world, still turning humans into Energizer batteries. So please enlighten me what's the purpose of the last three movies again?The antagonist comes in the form of ""The Analyst"", who boots up a virtual machine &amp; runs his version of Matrix in it - powered by dual-core Neo-Trinity processors. The movie tries to become philosophical &amp; explore the meta-theme but fails tremendously. All the 4th wall breaking &amp; character self-awareness makes it look more like a joke. Yeah, this movie feels more like a parody of itself as it progresses further (WTF with Catrix?). The love story of Neo-Trinity is fine, but the movie as a whole feels soulless &amp; lost the magic touch of the originals.The first movie is the best &amp; it should have ended there. Although the sequels are bad we have fond memories of certain scenes &amp; actions in them. Remember watching the 1st one and your jaw-dropped seeing the bullet time for your 1st time? In Reloaded you'll remember the highway chase scene and the fight with Smith's clones. Revolutions have the battle with sentinels. In this new iteration, they are out of ideas &amp; we are served with parkour zombies (aka bot) instead. What?! Neo never fires a single bullet &amp; becomes a force Jedi &amp; it turns out that Trinity can fly too! So where are we going with this? Another sequel? New trilogy? He'll no!All the throwbacks from the old scenes make it worst as we missed those films more than ever before. Dear WB, if you need a new idea I'll give you one, FOC of course. Make the live-action of The Second Renaissance. Tells the story of pre-Matrix era. That would be cool. You're welcome.",4
1819,"This movie is horrible. Storyline, script, fight scenes... Everything is wrong with it. Convoluted, unjustifiable and boring. Thank goodness I saw it on HBO Max because otherwise I would've regreted it.The original Matrix came out in 1999 and it was truly revolutionary, but this movie tries to piggy back on the nostalgic memories of fans yet it miserably failed.",3
1820,"Another reviewer said it best, this is a bunch of fan service. Call backs and references to the original with literal flashbacks to scenes from the movies...constantly. If it was TRUE fan service they would have paid this sequel its due respect and gave it a better story and originality. They took deadpool level jokes and inserted it every five minutes. The only reason for three stars is for the work of Keanu and Carrie Ann (who looks so freaking amazing) and the natural storyline progression of AI wanting to fight with Zion. Really that is the only redeeming quality of the storyline. The writers clearly watched Alien resurrection far too many times, but tried to mask the replication with NPH. Neil Patrick Harris did well with what he had to work with.",3
1821,It takes extreme talent to continue a series of movies with equal quality but the wachowskis are such talented writers they yet again have done just that!I found this movie action packed and as entertaining as its predecessors all kudos to the writers and cast .Keeanu reeves and Carrie Ann moss are a great team and maintain their roles perfectly also credits to new cast members all were great in their roles.One of my top movies this year!,9
1822,"Were you offended by The Matrix Resurrections? Good, that's the point. You haven't changed. You saw the originals and continued to take your blue pill: go to work, maintain and harbor affinity for the nostalgia created in your mind. Go see your therapist.This film works as a perfect return to form: a capsule of everything modernized attempting to replay nostalgia; from the way it's presented, filmed, written, and characters portrayed. Your mind wants to revoke it because it's not some time locked piece of continued fiction from the early 00's. AND THAT'S THE POINT.As a conclusion to the series, (because I don't particularly see this getting a sequel, not for being reviewed as ""bad"" but because it's actually a reasonable conclusion) it successfully rights the wrongs of the original trilogy.",10
1823,I ask why - not why did they make it as that's obvious - $$$ - but why are the characters doing what they are doing? I just couldn't work out the reason for the action. This sort of thing happens all the time when you resurrect a series that finished. All too often you either deny the original happened to generate a new plot or you simply don't bother with a reason for the reboot to exist and just grab the cash. Sadly the latter has happened here. There was no reason I could see for what was happening on screen and that ultimately negates the whole point of a film. We have yet another big budget film with a garbage screenplay / script. I remember when films used to tell a story and long for such an old fashioned thing to return. It gets a six because I remember the original fondly and have yet to remove the rose tinted specs. Tomorrow I may score it lower.,6
1824,"The Matrix Resurrcetions is the latest film in the Matrix film series and is directed, partly written and produced by Lana Wachowski, who co-created the further Matrix series with her sister.In the film, Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) just lives his life, but still feels that something is not quite right. When he comes into contact with Bugs (Jessica Henwick), he gets the chance to break out of his illusion and go back to real life as Neo. To do this, he must together with old acquaintances, some of which are in a different form, to stop the stronger form of the Matrix again.Making a new Matrix movie was only an idea at first with the Wachowskis, but for a long time it seemed better to both of them to keep the film series as a trilogy. Lana Wachowski later had ideas to continue with the film series, to avoid a remake of the series by the film studio. She also returned to the series for personal reasons, but her sister Lilly did not want to participate in this fourth film for the same reason.Despite trying to avoid a remake of the series, this fourth film largely comes across as a remake. They make a lot of use of old previously used aspects in this film. In this way, in addition to interesting ideas, the film still comes across as familiar and not creative. For a better and more entertaining film you should actually just watch the first Matrix. The film itself may come across as familiar due to its lack of original ideas or storylines. The only new thing in the film is that it uses meta humor, but this is largely inappropriate in the film. As a viewer, you can even get something out of the film because of this.Compared to the first Matrix, this new film is also disappointing, because the first Matrix was really a revolutionary film for the film world and has further changed and influenced it a lot. After 22 years it is a pity to see that they have come further with little news and that this film comes across as a standard film. Despite the fact that the film world has become more digital and this film has been recorded in an improved way, the film still lacks special aspects with special effects. Due to the popularity of special effects in movies, some effects seem less realistic compared to other modern movies. While it's nice to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss back in their familiar roles, they don't get much new to work with and can seem a bit repetitive. Jessica Henwick is best portrayed in this film as a new and original character, who tries to save the old acquaintances from the Matrix again. Other well-known characters also return in this sequel, but are played by different actors. The well-known actors who played these characters in previous installments were unfortunately unable to return for this fourth film due to busy schedules. Replacement actors such as Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Neil Patrick Harris know how to portray their replacement roles in the film in their own way. Unfortunately, they don't come close to how the characters have emerged earlier in the Matrix series. Jonathan Groff himself unfortunately does little original for his replacement role and seems to almost only copy the actor who played the role in the previous film. For fans, these new faces with the well-known characters can take some getting used to, but fortunately, except for a single replacement, they do not come across as annoying.",4
1825,"Most idiotic movie this year, no wonder they rushed to hbomax . I think people wanted they money back in the theaters. They jumped from one thing to another and could not follow.",1
1826,"Sorry, I just couldn't do it. I couldn't stay awake through this movie. The plot and script is unnecessarily convoluted to make it seem as though the movie is smarter than it actually is. The characters come across as unbelievably cringe-worthy. The shaky, close-up filming style made me nauseous, and the fight choreography is sub-par. Reeves deserved better (or perhaps not, he should never have agreed to this project in the first place).I'm not sure why this needed to be made, other than to destroy another famous franchise in order to make a quick buck, or to deconstruct the old matrix trilogy in order to establish a ""progressive"" agenda in the films. I doubt we will see a sequel.",3
1827,"It's time to stop giving Lana Wachowski (and his brother for that matter) chances at making big budget movies. The first Matrix was great, the second Matrix was fine, the third Matrix was not good and pretty much everything else they've made after that has been mediocre or down right awful. For Jupiter Ascending alone they should've been given a 10 year timeout. This movie wasn't as bad as Jupiter but, it was still significantly below average. No spoilers and I still say you should see it for yourself but... I'm starting to think they got lucky with the first one and that they don't actually have very much talent. I wouldn't be shocked if someone else was a ghost writer and the Wachowski's just directed the action. Which brings me to another point.... the first Matrix had ground breaking action scenes, the second one wasn't too far behind but everything since has been... meh, things we've already seen before. They're clearly been just mailing it in since 2003. And this latest entry by Lana was clearly just a cash grab. I understand why Hugo and Lawrence passed... whatever they might say in public, the real reason was the script was garbage.",4
1828,"Why Keanu, why? Why star in such drivel. Terrrible plot development, awful acting. Unbelievable story that you just care about. Basically they rewite and undo the previous movies and say hey, women rule. It might just let you know if you are woke and in need of a brain.",1
1829,"The Matrix Regurgitations (which it will henceforth be known) is a movie _completely without conviction_. I'd give it a 0/10 if I could.Sprawling storyline, some slow-mo scenes looking like a B-film, uninspired acting, botched casting (plus, iconic actors such as for Morpheus and Agent Smith have been replaced), terrible exposition (telling/explaining instead of showing), awful pacing... Do you enjoy characters in your scifi-action flick suddenly sitting down and emoing it out (exhaustively..), like an episode of New Girl? No? I thought not. No disrespect to New Girl, which I've heard is great, in its own terms. To be frank, The Matrix Regurgitations feels like it was devised in a therapy session... The only good part is the CGI in the outside world. But it just doesn't make up for the rest. To top it off, the movie gives frequent flashbacks to the old movies, just as if to taunt you, because then you remember actually how great they were in comparison. It tells you a lot when even the clips of the old movies are the best part of this new one.My friend and I had to stop watching it halfway through, because it was so painful to watch. I was the only one who continued watching it later on, just so I could say I have seen the (entire) movie. But for the future, I will suppress the experience, and forget and that this movie ever happened.That said: I love scifi-movies! They're my favorite genre, and I've watched all of the Matrix and Animatrix movies from before.If you have a love of scifi, your time and your money is much more well spent watching or re-watching the new Dune movie, which is an easy 10/10.I'm usually not so polarized in my views, haha. But man...",1
1830,This was absolutely awesome. Seeing Keanu reeves looked so good being in the matrix again . And flashbacks from 1999 and other years just brings memories of seeing the first movie on vhs 22 years ago . I say this one made a remarkable comeback.Back to the matrix.,10
1831,I'm actually kinda ticked at KR for doing this blatant cash grab. Whoever greenlighted this disaster should be thrown off a building to see if they can fly...like CM...who I'm also ticked at for doing this blatant cash grab.,1
1832,"...you were wrong. Terrible from the start. I tried to watch as long as I could but daydreamed through most of it, until something better to do came up, which was clipping my toenails and going to bed for an early night's sleep. I forced myself through maybe 15 minutes.",2
1833,"This is my first review for any movie. I'm a massive fan of movies, in general. The Matrix is in the top of my favorites list. I wanted to like this movie. I still want to like it but I can't. The Matrix was groundbreaking in many ways. To resurrect original storytelling, state of the art CGI, and one of the last movies to capture great martial arts, one would assume the writing and directing would need to be more than on point. Unfortunately, Resurrection was a miss in my opinion.There was some good, hence the 4 stars. Neil Patrick Harris nailed his role, I did like the Analyst. I also liked what they attempted to do with Neo and the mental health plot line, but again, I think it fell flat with all the nostalgia and goof ball b.s. ""It's bullet time"" and ""time to fly"" feel very out of place and don't belong anywhere near The Matrix. Those aren't even the worst. Maybe hand the keys to new writing/directing or let us forget this happened.It really does hurt my soul to write such a review to a movie I thought would change movies like it could and should have - again.",4
1834,"Of course it's not as good as the first one and thankfully it's a lot better than the 2nd and 3rd ones. You do need to have seen at least the 1st one to have any idea of what's going on, so newbies should start there.I'll start with the positives - the action scenes are great - it was never going to be as ground-breaking as the first one but the camera work in the fight scenes is spectacular - you feel right in the middle of the action. It must be seen on a big screen - the crisp images and thumping sounds make it feel like a digital remastering of your favourite 1970s music.In the ""OK"" category is the storyline. Vaguely credible, not at all original but probably just about enough to write the 4th film. Some nice references back to the original series and Keanu Reeves plays the confused hero well once again.But the disappointing bit is both the ending (won't spoil it) and the overall feeling that something is missing. To continue the music metaphor, it's like watching a mediocre cover-band playing your favourite band's music. It ticks some of the boxes but is nowhere as good as the real thing.It was always going to be hard to come close to the quality of the 1st Matrix and it really doesn't. But I've certainly seen worse and the time did go fairly quickly after a slightly slow (but deliberately so) start. For big Matrix fans it'll probably do enough to make it feel worthwhile, but if you weren't a fan of the first series, there's nothing new for your here.7/10 for me.",7
1835,"All it does is regurgitate old lines in a terrible plot that feels wrong the entire time. Politics aside, this movie is absolute garbage. If you are trying to take back the term ""red pill"" then don't make the entire movie a ""blue pill."" There is nothing original in this movie, and even references the movie Studio itself wanting to make more sequels for money. It's atrocious.",1
1836,"Ugh...I love the Matrix. This movie just doesn't cut it though. I give it a star for the CGI, a star for Keanu Reeves, a star for Carrie Moss, and a star for the cat. The story is pretty much not anything I ever thought I'd see and it really only goes to show how out of touch the Hollywood elite is from the fans and normal people.This one isn't about Neo at all. It's all about Trinity and they may as well have said that she is the ONE. Some of the character changes are ok, but it's not the same. It's whatever though since I know it's tough to get back all the original characters. The analyst character and story was weird and Niobe's character was dumb. Some of the fight scenes were ok, but Neo only went X-Men and created a shield the whole time. Like, ok yeah we get it he can stop bullets.Oh yeah, and the analyst using the term ""bullet time"" was junk writing. They just wasted a great opportunity.",4
1837,"Oh my God was I expecting (and somehow fearing) this movie!I'm out of the theater for a couple of hours now and I must admit that this fourth Matrix is a)pure entertainment, b)reflexive and meta and c)genuinely ironical. The best Matrix so far? Not sure but let time decide...lol...Oh, done just for money? Really? Let me laugh: it's done exactly for those who still have a brain, a soul... and of course a (real/natural) heart.Less and less people, as it seems. Sadly...snif, snif. Corona? Oh, then just reload folks... or resurrect, whatever! But: I know, it isn't that easy. Just a question of choice...Wow: How right the Washowskis (or Lana) still are, we humans just get what we deserve!BRAVO to everyone involved in this 4th chapter! One of the best films so far this year and what a saga: mesmerising from start to finish. I'm overwhelmed (and glad that I kept fait after the two very good and recomforting teasers).But an open mind and tolerance is hardly requested, of course.P.

1840,"A complete disaster for Matrix fans. If anyone wanted to destroy the Matrix trilogy, they could'nt have destroyed the good memory of the Matrix more than this movie.",2
1841,"Neo lives a seemingly ordinary life, but when a different version of Morpheus and a mysterious woman confirm his suspicions about the world around him, Neo joins a group of rebels to free an old friend and battle a new danger.Director Lana Wachowski offers wonderful visuals it's a finely produced sequel that is welcomed after the bleak deflating ending of the third. This doesn't try to be innovative in terms of special effects, but it effortlessly offers spectacle in a straightforward way expanding the franchise.The Matrix Resurrections' Matrix has a sterile crispnesses about it that sets it apart from its predecessor. While the real world feels more organic thanks to leaps in special effects found in modern movies. Writers Lana Wachowski, David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemo creatively deliver a handful of self-referential material under the guise of Neo's memories used in games he designed. It even alludes possibly why Wachowski filmed this sequel for Warner Brothers. While a fan pleaser, sometimes they are too on the nose, however, it also allows for a lot of hokey exposition to be digestible. With the use of familiar music cues, callbacks and fine character performances the apprehensions of a new Matrix film melt away.Age differences are plausibly explained away. The ageing make-up of Jada Pinkett Smith as Niobe doesn't hold up under scrutiny and can be a little distracting. Nevertheless, Smith is on form. Also, the recasting of characters does feel off. That said, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II performance as Morpheus along with the rest of the cast is great. Lana and company sell the changes within the story. There are family connections to previous characters, and many of the old characters show up in flashbacks.Neil Patrick Harris is a welcomed addition. Keanu Reeves returns as Thomas Anderson / Neo along with Carrie-Anne Moss and are fantastic however, Jessica Henwick's Bugs is notable and gives them both a run for their money. Lambert Wilson The Merovingian returns but is deranged and slight wasted. Some elements feel rushed, while others feel drawn out, which wouldn't be a problem if they were balanced or stretched out either way. It comes down to this, Resurrections, is about Neo and Trinity, being the One, together as one. Shootouts, fights, technology and heart it has everything synonymous with what you'd expect from a Matrix film.Overall, it shoehorns everything in a fan could want while staying true to the first three. It is a welcomed addition. Even if slightly flawed, mainly due to pacing. After credit scene aside, recommended.",
1842,They couldn't even leave matrix alone and had to turn it into female empowerment bs. I'd rather see a complete remake than this continuation with the glitchy like effect I don't know what they tried to do but it failed badly. Honestly so disappointed in the studio and keanu for agreeing to this. Bad from start to finish.,1
1843,"A very complicated reuniting of a couple of digital souls, in a love story, that was encased in a very good special FX film with a weak script. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about the film but found the story was so weak, and flat, it did not seem to have been worth making it as a connect the dots film...that it failed to do! Even with a weak script - IMHO - the actors all played their roles very well, though Jada Pinkett-Smiths role I feel would have been better played by someone such as Whoopi Golsdberg...as the prosthetic aging just didn't seem fitting.There will no doubt be much discussion about this (and I think Matrix diehard fans will not be too happy with it) and a ton of money will be made. However I feel it will be known as the worst of the franchise and easily forgotten in time. I also feel that the way it finished that we can expect another in the future!",8

1845,"It's nearly impossible to warn of a ""spoiler alert"" in a film so absolutely fixated on constantly reminding us of our favourite bits from the previous films, and not just here and there, but litteraly non stop all throughout the movie.Also cant think of anything I could say about the storyline that could be a ""spoiler"". It's that thin,.. or pointless.This movie was genuinely painful to watch and often much closer to a comedy than anything else.Left the cinema angry :(Love the original Matrix :)",1
1846,"We all know what a let down the two matrix sequels were. No need to dive into that. I feel like this movie makes up for those two atrocious films in a big way. I was worried when I heard of another movie, how could they do it? But they pulled it off. I loved how they tied it altogether. That's the biggest draw for me, storytelling. I knew they would have beautiful visuals, and some excellent action scenes. But the story, and the talented cast take it to the next level.I won't give any spoilers here, but if you were a fan of the original, see this movie ASAP. It was made for you. If you didn't like it, get your head checked.",9
1847,"This was a film clearly written by a man who transitioned to a woman, which is painfully evident. All the male cast members save the ONE that was absolutely necessary are peripherals or evil. And even he can't get it up and must be saved by the new female ONE! Where a woman proves she doesn't need a husband or children to be a super woman! And sacrifices them with hardly a thought. The rest is Regurgitated slop from the original. I tried watching a second time to see if it grew on me. I fell asleep.",1
1848,"WB's great shame for making a scandalous sequel after years of waiting ... Wachowski made this sequel only to the cinematographers and did not adhere to any of the Matrix values*Lack of commitment to the wonderful philosophical themes of the Matrix*No new ideas*Very weak characterizations*No storyline....Better not talk more than this, I wish this sequel was never madekeihan.",4
1849,This movie is the sad demonstration of how decadent and degraded the American culture and Hollywood have become in just two decades.Oh god. I'm sure that if the L. A. desert could speak it would finally reveal from whom the Wachowskis stole the screenplay of the original Matrix back in 1999.,3
1850,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie. I did my best. Just couldn't. Enjoyed that the Wachowskis could actually create another layer to the Matrix mythos. Also that the movie was self-concious in several scenes. Those we're the highlights.The downside? Weak characthers, poor action sequences (worse than anything 20 years prior), and made a joke of major storyline themes.The unforgivable? The One is not the TWO. And when will Hollywood stop politicizing everything. Good God.",5
1851,"Very bad taste, planning, and execution. A product of degeneration and decadence. Very bad taste, planning, and execution. A product of degeneration and decadence.

1852,This movie is made of:10% a cut and paste parts from old movies15% of remaking the very same scenes from old movies20% Meta commentary that breaks the immersion yet somehow doesn't add anything5% an interesting main villain15% combat that lack all energy and choreography10% genuinely new and exciting ideas10% romcom elements15% videogames as a medium commentary.,2
1853,"The premise was there . The actors brought their A game. Then the execution was bizarre , oddly paced, squeaky clean, confusing fighting giving way to a desperate focus on hitting notes that were out of tune, and time, with the whole production. The beginning was promising , sure a bit hokey but I chalked it up to nostalgia and bringing people up to speed . The beautiful story telling was woven in nicely and carried me though the first hour .Then what followed was a low stakes , long -drawn out rescue mission that could have gone swimmingly in 15 minutes yet took over the second half of the movie. There were some memorable visuals like Morpheus jumping the pods but even that felt disjointed and unnecessary.It lacked the grit and that visceral imagery as it sugar coated a new generation who frankly should haven't had time to have their hair done.I thought the new agent was great and I didn't mind the new cast , their efforts were lost to a disjointed production. It was shiny where it should have been stark and the chosen one(s) felt like a forced afterthought when it could have been sick . Well this is probably the worse review I have ever written and I feel guilty about it. I appreciate the effort. It's really a 6 the whole premise and work put in is solid - a solid 6 but I am giving it a 7 because it's not an unlikable movie . A 7 to me means universally watchable yet all about preference ,.plus , making a follow up so many years later is admirable.",7
1854,This movie was a mess. We don't deserve such a mess. And KR looked like John W. The creators could not give him a new look? And why make a sequel if the creators can not get the original cinematographers and stunt choreographers who worked and made the first film original and stunning? This movie felt and looked like a student project produced by YouTube.,3
1855,"O primeiro filme era muito bom. Na realidade, ainda é e sempre será. Já esse primeiro filme da nova trilogia é muito devagar. Não há novidades que te prendem como na trilogia original, o que é uma pena. Seria melhor deixar os originais sozinhos.The first movie was really good. In reality, it still is and always will be. This first movie of the new trilogy is very slow. There are no novelties that hold you like in the original trilogy, which is a shame. It would be better to leave the originals alone.",1
1856,"This movie hurt me. I love the scene in the original Matrix where Neo fights with Morpheous in the dojo and his fight in the subway with Mr. Smith. The Matrix was a cool new concept and story was really captivating. But I feel this sequel didn't deliver. They nerfed Neo, he barely talks and his fights were lacking, and those are his forte. The movie felt rushed and the characters felt hollow. It hurt me to watch them ruin Neo. The best part of this movie was the role of the analyst played by Neil Patrick Harris. His character was interesting and outshined the rest of the cast. I blame bad writing for this attack on my memory of The Matrix Trilogy.",2
1857,"As the title says, it's a good looking movie... but it has none of the original magic, not even the lesser magic from the two parts after it. The movie was predictable, the story seems rushed and full of holes and cliches.",5
1858,"I'm trying to be extremely subjective, i will focus on the Story, Concept, and Cinematic action.The Story: There is no correlation between The Matrix Movie and this one, while the Matrix storey was very deep, this one is extremely shallow and just brought up from our daily lives with extremely poor delivery. Coming out of the movie, there isn't anything to think about except that there will be more sequels ($$), i can go on but i believe the story should be given 1 out of 10 and this is a clear indicator that the writer of this Story cannot be the same writer for the first one as people has fingerprints to their work and it is simply not there.Concept: The Matrix Concept focused on The One, from the beginning till the end, and this movie and about the Two, basically they trying to create another Marvel story somehow, however it is the same actress, you just changed the role of the One making him the Two, and this is a clear indicator that this isn't the same movie.The Cinematic: Serious speaking, If you compared the Cinematic used in The Matrix in 1999 and this one, you can notice clearly that it is better at every level. The Action was poor, slow, pathetic.In 1999 The total production budget was 63 MillionIn 2021 The total production budget was 190 MillionThat's a 202% increase yet let us review the revenue:Box Office Gross :The Matrix (1999) 171,479,930The Matrix (2021) $22,500,000This is a devastating -87% decrease.After all, if the company produced this move increased the budget over 200% and this delivered such low rating and income, they either don't care about income and the most important to them is to pass a message that honestly i couldn't find it, as the movie was plain poor, alternatively, these are not the same people, and the new writers and producers should find another career.",3
1859,"I have seriously never seen a movie creator hate their creation so much that they felt the need to rewrite the same movie yet remove all the good parts of it and fill it with dumb action, no stakes or uninteresting side characters.Does anyone remember that first movie Matrix? Well Lana sure does and judging by this movie, she hates it so much that she immediately wanted to burn it and all bridges between them in this new movie.Why? Well she and her sister might have caught lightning in a bottle that one time because she never outgrew it and that is probably why she hates it so much, no one remembers her as the writer of Jupiter Ascending or director(not writer) of V for Vendetta. Nope, her name is right there in the Matrix's shadow for all her life and that is probably why she wanted to make this movie. Why? Because she took the opportunity to clear up the message of her movie and that was: "" don't think about it and don't ask me about meanings, that was just me after consuming alcohol and mushrooms and watching anime for the first time.""So this was her out of the Matrix franchise and a paycheck from WB for her next movie because this movie might not kill the Matrix and their billions but it does kill any anticipation fans might have had for a Matrix movie to be continued by the original authors.",5
1860,"Literaly one third of the movie are flashbacks from the trilogy. Actors are auful and dont fit the role, dialoges are silly, there is no meaning in this movie. Its too sad cuz the trilogy movies were some of the best movies ever made. Boring ,meaningless , poor.. costumes ,senatio, acting,dialoges, music, direction,fights, etc etc are so low, nothing to see.",1
1861,In 1999 the world wasn't ready to hear Wachowski sisters story. They sugar coated the story and everyone's taste buds went into overdrive.It's 2021 and Lana believes its time to get everyones head out of the sand and face the reality!The Matrix Resurrections is exactly what I didn't expect it to be. It's genius and so smart that only few will fully comprehend Lana's vision and intentions.How we consume things changed. These days the audience expects to be carried into the films core on cotton clouds with a glass of champagne in one hand and charcuterie plate in the other. And that's why many masterpieces in recent years get get so little acknowledgement but flicks packed with senseless action and stories of little substance become the go to movies.The story telling technique Lana uses is almost extinct in the film industry these days. Lana laser cut this technique and polished it over the years to a very high standard.The Matrix Resurrections is THE ONE movie you'll need to watch with your eyes glued to the screen (every second of it) and with your brain plugged fully into your consciousness.,10
1862,"The main actors are really getting too old for this. And the story is incredibly bland. On top of that, some of the choices made by the characters are borderline illogical.",4
1863,"Story-wise the movie could be satisfactory, I appreciate the idea how to return the original characters to the matrix. But the sheer amount of the scenes from the original trilogy is quite annoying and unnecessary.Second, the action scenes are poorly made. In some cases it's due to a frequent camera changes, making it difficult to track the action, in other - simply not enough ""action"" itself.Third, the development inside the matrix from some point became too rushed and quickly unbelievable. It lasts until the end of the movie, leaving plot holes that shouldn't have been there in the first place.I cannot blame actors, albeit I've expected more action from Keanu, but I guess age puts its limits. New actors, including Morpheus, are good enough.Overall, it all boils down to a story. A story what has happened to humans after Matrix 3. Unfortunately, while this story has some good parts, overall feels unbelievable for the fans.I'd say it's worth watching just to see the vision of the authors, but it falls short of even moderate expectations.",6
1864,"I saw The Matrix NINE TIMES when it was in the theater. Best movie ever made.But this? Where is Lawrence Fishburn? Where is Hugo Weaving? Kenu is great, but this was doomed to fail without them. Disappointing.",4
1865,"30mins in and you could tell it ain't going to be good... At this point you know you've thrown away good money to watch something that can't even compare to the original ,so you force yourself to watch it ,praying it gets better,... it doesn't ... I would never buy this disaster of a movie to add it to the trilogy, Honestly save your money.......",1
1866,This movie is a joke a waste of time.Matrrix 1 should be the only film all the rest of them are pointless.And tihis one the worst of all.Plus same endind as the first matrix.We should stop watching al this sequel movies there are only to milk the cow from core base fans.,1
1867,"The matrix was always a polarising movie franchise so a fourth movie was bound to receive some flak and it was clear that it would be hard to follow in both the footsteps and spirit of the previous three films. And I admit that I was sceptical at first as to how great a fourth film could possibly be - specially 22 years after the first film had been released but the movie pulled me in. And now, almost 24 hours after having seen the film, I think that this is the best film in series. The plot in The Matrix was always a little abstract and could be hard to digest, so in order for this fourth film to successfully stay true to the story-line from the first three films, there had to be a twist to justify Trinity's reappearance and explain what happened after Neo's apparent triumph against the machines in the third film. To meet the criticism from many negative critics, we have to recognize that stranger and more surreal films have been released recently so there is nothing in here that should truly shock the audience. The story line will mess with your head in the beginning but it becomes clearer as the story progresses. My advice is that if you haven't seen the film yet, don't expect this to be another ""Die Hard-like"" film, and in spite of it being released just before Christmas, it is NOT a Christmas film. It is truly the sequel to an already mind-blowing trilogy and you will be taken for a ride. I thought it was brilliant and Lana Wachowski deserves lots of credit for keeping the storyline true to the original trilogy while still evolving the story. It is definitely worth watching.",8
1868,"For putting me asleep 5 days in a row. That's how good and interesting this movie was. Story was plain boring, characters too flat and cringy. There is almost zero action in this movie and action that they showed us was ridiculously bad. Just boring jabbering that went on and on and on that I forgot about almost instantly, like I forgot last weeks fart. Well, at least they managed to do one good thing(for them) and that is to grab as much money as you can from these sucker.",2
1869,I have always been a Matrix lover. I can't even finish the first hour of it on HBO. Disappointing doesn't even begin to explain what potential you ruined for all of us Matrix fans.,1
1870,"I'm sure people have said this. It's the Matrix...but done in a shoved down your throat and not overally new or interesting way. Action isn't good, and ""themes"" are the same.One thing I will say is mental illness/suicide is handled very poorly/crassly in this movie. Opening 40 min is deeply uncomfortable-especially since it somewhat encourages a whole ""oh youre not ill, it's society that's ill!"" attitude which I find deeply problematic.",5
1871,"Okej, how to start?This might have been the worst i have ever watched. This will be remebered as The biggest flop in modern film.Story make no sense at all, i really dont understand it still. Who or what was this Morpheus dude?Naoibi was a nightmare to watch, painfull acctually.The only part that was good was when Neo tried to fly but could not..Yepp this was just a waste of my time.. Do your self a big favour and dont watch it.",1
1872,Not as smart as original trilogy buy a great rebootGood use of nostalgia and new content.Fight sense were a bit over the top but nothing to hate.Neil Patrick was underused.,8
1873,"My biggest disappointment of the year. The two Matrix sequels were not good at all and they were chaos, but at least they had interesting points or something else in the photography (when entering the Matrix there was a whole different color palette). But Matrix Ressurections is left in a painful attempt to bring back a saga that should have stayed in the first movie.The plot adds absolutely nothing and it feels like seeing the first solo that centered on Neo and Trinity's love that brings them back for nothing. The new characters do not bring anything interesting (a disappointment, since Jessica Henwick had a lot of potential) also, the return of ""Morpheus"" is bland and does not add anything to the plot.The action is horrible and the special effects nothing new. The production design, like the whole movie, is very bland.In conclusion and even if it has redeemable things (like the first act) it is very bad. Without a doubt Neo and Trinity should have remained dead along with this saga.",3
1874,"I'd like to congratulate Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving for moving on and avoiding this mess.Of course that didn't stop the studio from still inserting old footage of them into this.Shame on the rest of the returning cast and established actors for this. It was a pure money grab, with no backing to it. The plot wandered all over the place, the acting was weak at best. They almost phoned this one in for a pay check... heck they probably could have done most of their parts over zoom.",2
1875,I just watched this movie and was disappointed. Although I did not expect a good movie but neither a horrible one. The story is okay but the logic in it is not. For me it was nothing what the old Matrix movies used to give me. This movie was more liberal in contrast the old ones.,2
1876,"The title of my review says it all. I don't usually even write reviews, but had to warn people. Save yourself.Big fan of the originals btw. This movie ruined the legacy.That's all I feel like saying. Do not watch.",1
1877,"It starts off promising, you immerse yourself in the world and narrative, but by the halfway mark you're stunned by disbelief. It feeds off nostalgia. There is nothing new; It tries to be clever, but in reality it comes off as silly and stupid, and after you're done watching you sit back asking: Why? Why in God's name Why?",2
1878,"Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a successful game programmer whose trilogy of The Matrix video games earned him recognition and success, but despite this he is a depressed and isolated man who routinely sees an Analyst (Neil Patrick Harris) to discuss his fragile state. The high point of Thomas' days are his chance encounters with a married woman named Tiffany (Carrie-Anne Moss) whom despite never having met her he shares a connection. Thomas is under pressure from parent company Warner Bros. To deliver a new Matrix game despite him not wanting to, and his encounters with inane focus groups and marketing notes is beginning to wear on him. However when Thomas starts seeing Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) a supposedly fictional character from The Matrix games, the lines between real and unreal are blurred.The Matrix film series ended pretty definitively with the two parter films Reloaded and Revolutions back in 2003. The Wachowskis were routinely approached by Warner Bros. With questions about continuation and rumors had even circulated since 2011 regarding Warner Bros. Desires for continuation of the series and franchise. Eventually Lana Wachowski came up with a pitch that Warner Bros. Accepted (and according to Lana and dialogue in the movie itself Warner Bros. Would've made a sequel with or without them) and Warner Bros. Readily accepted the offer. Lilly Wachowski does not return along with Lana due to prior commitments on the Showtime series Work in Progress. While I do give the movie a recommendation, I completely understand why people wouldn't like it, but it's probably my second favorite Matrix after the first one.During the first hour of the movie, the film plays itself in a metatextual fashion similar to Wes Craven's New Nightmare where's it's a sequel while also blurring the lines between fiction and reality with elements bleeding into one another. Keanu Reeves performance is really strong as Thomas Anderson and its unquestionably the most human and relatable the role has been since the first film back in 1999. The romance between Thomas and Tiffany is also really well done and the fact that the movie isn't cramming in techno-babble suffocated exposition with long drawn out scenes of Navel-gazing makes the story much stronger and more resonant (for me anyway) on a character level than either Reloaded or Revolutions ever did. The first hour is definitely the best part of the movie where it plays with the audience's understanding of reality but once we reach the remaining 60% we're basically just another Matrix movie.Despite us traversing very familiar territory in the remaining 90 minutes I did enjoy seeing the advancements and divergences in the world since we left it twenty years ago. Some elements are interesting but aren't as fully developed as the could've been such as different factions of machines that are hostile and friendly, and there's a returning secondary character who's featured in some of the worst ""old person"" make-up I've seen since Guy Pearce in Prometheus. For me this part of the movie was okay. It had clear direction and an emotional core with the romance unquestionably the strongest it's been in any of these movies (and yes, I'm including the first one) and it's not overburdened with ancillary characters who were given more prominence in video games or direct to video animated projects that the movie expects you to already be familiar with.The Matrix Resurrections has many flaws and criticisms that I can see people pointing as their reason for disliking the film and I really can't fault them on it because they'd be perfectly valid. With that said, I enjoyed the movie overall and was entertained by the themes (even if in Wachowski fashion it's as subtle as a sledgehammer) and the returning performances of Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss as well as new performances such as Neil Patrick Harris, Jessica Henwick, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. The movie doesn't reach the level of the first Matrix, but for my money it exceeds Reloaded and Revolutions.",7
1879,This is Matrix in name only. The story feels more like a rehash of newer movies than a part of the old movies. This felt like Free Guy not The Matrix. Sadly it looks like this was just a cash grab.,3
1880,"As a huge fan of The Matrix Trilogy, hearing of The Matrix 4 being in production was very disappointing to me. How could they have chosen to create a 4th movie when 3 concluded perfectly? Why change several cast members? They must have done it for the money, I thought. I couldn't resist watching the first trailer though... there was a new, interesting vibe, a different approach within the same universe...I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised by The Matrix Resurrections!Just like The Matrix Trilogy, Resurrections was incredible. 18 years later they managed to create an intriguing story, a fresh look into the Matrix world while staying true to the characters and maintaining the same unique core. Original, Emotional, Epic while offering a clever and subtle Criticism of our time... The Wachowskis have always been pioneers of our time. If you've also been a fan of The Matrix Trilogy, you shouldn't miss this.",10
1881,"This movie, was never meant to be. The movie itself tells us - the production company forced their hand. It was either you make it, or we'll get someone else to do it. That's not the right reason to make a movie, but many such movies were made beforehand. Terminator 3 and 4, Mary Poppins 2 and so on. We must wake up and smell the coffee - that's why they call it ""the Industry"" most of the people producing movies do it in order to gain profits.Considering this, the movie could've been much worse, the actors did their work professionally, and the writing team set out from the start to explain to whomever wants to listen why they had to do it - which is the reason the entire thing is feeling like a parody at certain moments. And if you think about it this way, you'll realize it's not all that stupid. At certain moments it's even clever. Having said that, as a whole it's still a pale shade of the original reducing most of philosophy into the simplistic cliché ""nothing is stronger than love"" - love was there in the original but then it was an added layer. One more element that made it so fascinating. In this version the clever bits feel like they were added because the entire story became way too simplistic so they added a few clever twists. And then, because the entire atmosphere shifts when we do get the darker bits, they almost feel external. Not to mention the fact you realize all too often how senseless it is. Which means - suspension of disbelief doesn't work well enough, and suspension of disbelief is probably the very key to all good science fiction.Bottom line - the main reason it's so bad is that it's the fourth chapter for a trilogy that shouldn't have had a fourth chapter. If you stop for a second or two and think about it chapter two was an in between chapter that could never stand on it own; and the third chapter never stood a chance because the buildup was so over hyped that no movie could end it properly. So the real masterpiece was just the very first chapter which was real mind blowing in all aspects of movie making. So much so that we almost forgot that it was the only real gem of the entire franchise.",7
1882,"If you really liked this movie, it means you haven't studied the matrix philosophically. There is a product in the middle, and the disrespect to this product comes from its creator. I'm sorry I'm such a fan, I wish you never started. It's really shameful to make fun of your own fanbase in the fourth movie by getting bored of the Matrix story.",1
1883,"I loved M1, liked M2 and disliked M3, probably like the vast majority of fans. Ultimately, M2 and M3 didn't add anything for me and despite amazing action scenes, fell flat. I had high hopes that M4 would rescue the franchise, but sadly not.I wasn't sure who the hero or protagonist was, or what and why the characters were doing what they were doing. This wasn't because the plot was complicated, there was just no investment from any characters. I didn't care at all what happened to them.I guess this will now lead to M5, M6 etc. Much like Terminator and Aliens, we'll see a series of disasters that soil the original first film(s).Why oh why didn't I take the blue pill.",4
1884,"I was really looking forward to this sequel of the Matrix trilogy. But... what a disappointment. 1/4 of the movie is flash backs of the trilogy, nothing new added. All Neo can do in this matrix is stopping bullets. If you enjoyed the trilogy... skip this one!",3
1885,"Just like the song says, ""You gotta know when to hold em....."". They should have folded it at a trilogy. There are moments that live up to the originals, but not enough. Cringe worthy ones include Jada Smith and her ridiculous make-up and the new agent smiths clunky fight scenes. PLEASE don't make any more.",6
1886,"Uh ... I have been thinking about how to review the ""Matrix Resurrections"". I (and possibly many) have been patiently waiting to sit down to watch the fourth Matrix for as long as I remember. Admittedly, the second and third movies in the trilogy were not the greatest, but I could sit down and watch the first (original Matrix) anytime and anywhere ... a true master piece ... So, you could imagine the anticipation I had for the fourth. Well, It saddens me to say that after spending 2.5 hours of watching time, I was very disappointed. I could go on and on about what I felt was so bad, but you'll get to watch it and make up your own mind.In the briefest form of a review, I felt that it was Warner Brothers way of reminding us that how much we loved the original Matrix, where we would still go to cinema in this pandemic and watch a 2.5 hour movie (wearing a mask) just hoping that it would be merely as good as the first one.😔😔😔",3
1887,"If you're fan of the franchise, this is an absolute treat. If you watch this part randomly, you'd make nonsensical comments, as most of the reviews here say. The action, plot and visual effects were stunning. Although, it did feel like a long movie, but it had to be to fit all the plot in articulately. All the characters really played the part well. Bugs was a standout actor, what an addition. The background score wasn't as impactful as previous movies imo.Hopefully there is a part 5 soon.",10
1888,"I still believe The Matrix is one of the most significant films of my lifetime (not to mention, one of my best theater experiences ever). The sequels went awry because they tried to explain EVERYTHING. The action, vibes, and ideas still worked, but the details were never the point. This particular sequel worked better than the others because it was mostly a trippy fever dream version of The Matrix. What was that reflection? What does this mean? It worked best when I was confused and wondering. As a result, the first and last thirds were genuinely fun, even if the action was muddy; the middle third was a bit explain-y. Overall, though, pretty fun to hang with Neo and Trinity for a while (and forget that 3rd movie ever happened).",7
1889,"This movie was made for no other reason than to make money. It has no soul no vision no direction. The original trilogy was perfect and this doesn't add to the story but actually ruins it. The movie is full of nostalgia and Easter eggs which will make viewers happy. But the story is weak and it feels nothing like the original trilogy. New cast members feel uninspired. I love the matrix, some of my favourite movies of all time but just like game of thrones season 8, this movie ruins everything that came before. I can't rematch them again. Very disappointed in this movie.",4
1890,"I didn't even pay for my movie ticket and I want my money back. Literally everything about this movie was terrible. The fight choreography, the score, the acting, the scripting, the plot line, the cinematography, the editing. I can't say there was a single thing about the movie I actually enjoyed. Oh how the mighty have fallen.",1
1891,"Couldn't be worse,congratulations for ruining such a great original and turn it to a soapy cheesy and low level comic movie with bad choreography, cheap martial arts and stupid meaningless actions.What could be worse than this!?",4
1892,"The Matrix! The name alone conjures the unforgettable original 1999 movie, with the two lesser installments which followed. Any comparison between Resurrections and the trilogy comes to a screeching halt ten minutes into the bloated run time.This movie literally jumped the shark when the explanation for the Resurrected Neo and Trinity, was that they produced a lot of energy when they were put back in their jelly pods. Are you kidding me? I guess since the Architect was replaced by the Analyst, this super smart program just couldn't foresee the idiocy of that move.The movie is supposedly about the love story between the two main stars, Neo and Trinity. I've had blind dates go better than the freeze the moment hand holding which passed for meaningful love.As to the rest of this DOA movie, it literally tried to graft scenes of the original onto the action of the current movie. Suffice it to say this would result in a medical malpractice lawsuit as the grafts just don't take, and remind the viewer how lame this movie is compared to the one true Matrix.This movie really is as bad as the under 6 star average suggests. I am writing this review to warn others to stay away, but I'm afraid the message will get lost in the hopes that a 20 year hiatus will result in something beyond stultifying frames piled one after the other, forming this mess.The biggest moment of the movie was that it was Carrie-Anne Moss this time who gets to say, ""My name is Trinity"".In the end, there is no suspension of disbelief that would allow the jarring memories of the spectacular Matrix of 1999, to accept a 54 year old biker chick Trinity (even with Beverly Hills cosmetic work).Take my advice, choose the blue pill and maintain the good memories of the time ""The Matrix"" was an exhilarating roller coaster of rollicking fun and entertainment.",4
1893,"Without spoilers I though it was a fairly creative idea. Unfortunately the movie itself, vs the good idea, just doesn't really pan out.First off the movie is full of flashbacks to the original. A few flashbacks might have been okay but there's so many it just becomes tedious. Next up is the action, it just doesn't work anymore. I don't know if it's because it wasn't choreographed well, or wasn't edited well, or what, but none of the fight scenes had any impact.Several short clips had really bad lighting making it look like it was shot on VHS. There weren't lots of them but when they appeared they stuck out so bad it was jarring.And then, each thing is so arbitrary. We had this problem in the original trilogy where at the end of the first movie Neo is like a god but at the start of the second movie he's suddenly way less powered. So which is it now? Sometimes he seems powered up, other times it's like he's Neo before he becomes ""The One"". The same with other characters. Why is Smith so special. I guess ""because reasons"". Why does the new Analyst have seemingly more power than the previous one? Because reasons.And then finally, so much repetition. Smith and Neo fight again in a subway. Okay, and? Nothing new happens and further there's no reason for them to be fighting. They fight because the script writes that, not because it makes any logical sense. Morpheus and Neo fight . And? I had zero impact. It just felt like some they couldn't come up with anything new and though people would feel nostalgia for seeing familiar or semi-familiar places. But, no, It just felt cheap and uncreative.It's definitely the worst movie in the series. I'm actually a fan of 2 and 3. Sure they have issues but there are tons of great scenes in both. In 4 there is absolutely nothing memorable. In fact I just watched it and I remember almost nothing of interest.",5
1894,"I am a really fan of the matrix trillogy and i found this movie really offensive , they made this movie only for money and they dont wanna hide this , they said this in this movie . , really dont worth the cinema ticket.",1
1895,"Yes, there was nothing exciting or novel about this ""resurrection"" 80% talking to a therapist (literally) about feelings and may be 20% very standard non exciting action i have seen in million other movies. Couple right to me left in the middle, the person on the left snored through the movie: that is how exciting it was. Laod, Pryanka Chopra, really? Her bad nose job is so distracting, I couldn't focus on gibberish she was saying.Sorry Keanu, but this was just meh. 5 stars for nostalgia.",5
1896,Dont know why they make this pathetic movie...its previous sequence is good.. but this one is bore as hell.and its characters lacking acting also..i personally suggest dont waste ur money..,1
1897,"I wish I could rewind time and just stop at the trailer.. at least the magic would still be there, right there in my mind.Let's just purge this one and forget it ever happened, because it's just a pointless and lazy.The entire time it survives on rehash nostalgia,fan theories and being meta.It's just an overly unneccesary woke statement in the end.",4
1898,Honestly this movie is so bad it was done intentionally.The artistic vision and deeper thought which went into the matrix movies was obviously long gone from the director's mind.The action is boring an repetitive. Nothing innovative. Extremely cringe and the whole meta approach was done terribly. Absolute fail of execution.Save yourself the time and heartbreak if you've watched the first two.Absolutely no reason to watch this movie and zero relation to the magic which the first movies created.,1
1899,"I have to say, that number 4 was all over the place. The story was ok but this movie was casted horribly. It's a must to watch the entire Series because it shows how important the basic understand is of the Matrix + shows you how important it is when you cast certain roles in a movie.The New Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is not a good fix at all. Lawrence Fishbourne was missed greatly as his role in the first 3 movies was just a much better Fit.The Analyst (Neil Patrick Harris) role was just plain awkward.Plus New Agent Smith &amp; Agent Johnson just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the fact that sunglasses where not worn the entire time like the first 3.The 4th installment could have gone so many directions, but instead showed up with chaotic moments that really didn't lead to a good ending.",3
1900,For a Nostalgic Trip down memory lane it probably would of been better if they just did a HBO max reunion special of the Cast and Crew getting back together to talk about and celebrate the first movie then what they did here. Just seems like a complete waste of time and energy on a sequel nobody really asked for.,4
1901,"I cannot believe that professionals are able to produce a movie like this. How is that even possible? Everything you can imagine what could go wrong, it went wrong. Story, actor choice, acting, camera, music, dialogues, non-existence of originality. Missing dramaturgy, missing suspense, missing twists. It's devastating to watch Matrix Resurrections, even without the name Matrix it would be a direct-to-DVD C-movie. Actually it's called Resurrections but this movie achieved exactly the opposite: it brought Matrix movies to the grave.",
1902,"If you have not seen The Matrix, don't waste your time! If like me you are an old fan, then seeing your favorite characters might entertain you for 2 hours!20 years ago, I watched Matrix about 40 or 50 times. I loved it. I still know all of its dialogues! 20 years has passed and I'm 20 years older, but still a fan.The Matrix Resurrections is just a mediocre drama, as its rating is clearly showing that (5.8 at the time of writing this) While Matrix 2 or 3 were at least ""action"" movies, this one was not even action. It was not deep, not action, not serious, not sophisticated, not funny, not anything. It was nothing! Just a random story based on Matrix characters and elements.I gave it 5, not because it is actually 5, but because as an old fan, after 20 years it was nice to see Trinity and Neo!",5
1903,"The story is confusing and as the film goes on becomes an absolute joke. There's many references to the original trilogy that add nothing real as if there just to distract us with nostalgia because someone forgot to come up with any semblance of a plot. I wanted to see something epic instead I got recycled memories ripped from the originals without context , characters we don't really get to know in any meaningful way and bizzare appearances from familiar faces that have no apparent logic.If you love the matrix trilogy give this a swerve.Perhaps they should hire me to do the next remake at least you'd be entertained a little more.",2
1904,"If you go to theater you will be really disappointed to pay a ticket to see this.At some point Matrix 4 turn hardly watchable no surprise many people walk out: writers try to do so many things become a complete mess.At some points you feel like is a mashup of Matrix and Total Recall or Matrix and World War Z, maybe some people find these parts amusing but end in nothing.",3
1905,"I'm not going to waste my time for a full review... If The Matrix (1999) is Cambridge University Physics, at the utmost Matrix Resurrections (2021) is Trump University Cinematography!",3
1906,Some idiots are calling this movie woke? What? Do you even know what woke means? I gave her a 10 because of all the idiots you gave it a one but it's actually a seven. Good movie! All the things you would expect from the matrix.,10
1907,So slow!!.... Last 10 mins were the most exciting and even then disappointing!! 2 and a half hour film about setting Trinity free. Being a Matrix fan I expected so much more.... Such a let down!!,1
1908,Looks like an expensive Agents of Shield episode and is written like it's own SNL sketch. Those are the nicest things I have to say about the matter.I will surely watch this again with friends and bemoan the passing of the 90s or something like that.True garbage.,2
1909,I hope this movie sets the example of how horrible a reboot can crash and burn non stop. This is a slap to the face to all Matrix fans. This is an abomination to the series. It is a joke. A horrible spoof. A complete waste of time. This is my first time writing a review because I cannot fathom this atrocity. O M G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
1910,"Well, for starters, i did give this one a 10/10 (not because i do) but because all thefake haters who gives 1/10 (small kid opinions)I was attaly surpirised by the deepth of this film, at start was allready thinking 10/10 (40 mins in film) by the details and the script, well if You compare with the first matrix, sure cant give 10, but if you compare this to somthing so excellent you will be disapointed.Loved the small things and how they do the resurrection and the idea of power change, the manipulative minds, the insanity and beauty. Sure the fighting and shooting scenes wasnt good (well yes.) but if You want like shallow shooting watch some other like jin wick film, this is matrix so its sci fi and hope at its meybe not best, but a really really enjoyable start of a trilogy (well this looks like it)",10
1911,"Felt more like a sequel to ""Jupiter Descending"" (at the speed of light) than Matrix. Another Wachowski misfire which are little by little looking more like one-hit wonders than anything else.I have to confess after seeing the movie, I feel depressed with the looks of this testosterone-less Neo guy in the this film. The guy is literally dormant in every department. What a sad end!Extremely poor story, bad acting, poor choice of actor for known characters, joke-level CGI and special effects (look at the flying scene and how Neo and Trinity look with the pressure of the wires and all that). What a catastrophe. Completely novice-looking job!God knows how many possibilities existed for a new Matrix movie:hacking state management, causality, temporarily and arrow of time in the Matrix to push time back to revive certain elements or even charactersinducing parallel occurrences and pathways of causalityeven the almost-lame-but-yet-more-philosophical idea of Neo and Trinity having been re-incarnated as a new borns and yet connected back to the matrix again with them dreaming about their previous lives in the matrix in their new current lives and finding a way to get out again with the force of karma pushing them back again together.Literally, one can go to the bathroom and get out lightened and enlightened with 10 ideas for a 'matrix resurrection' movie 1000 times better than this.They could have even literally collected these ideas from fans on a site or something in the 20 years that they had. This whole 'design thinking oriented film-making' can lead to a much stronger commercial outcome if practiced.Nothing else to say. Only sadness and sorrow really.",4
1912,"I have regularly been watching the first movie once or twice per year. This movie just ruined my feelings about original movie too. I do respect the actors but the story is just nonsense. At first it made me feel like getting somewhere with the game story but but disappointment was close enough.It would have been a great story if we found out that neo was the real architect or something but not a chance, another love story after all...",5
1913,I had to stop watching this movie at 40th minute. What was the point of this movie? I am not sure. I am a huge fan of Matrix Trilogy . I even have a Matrix Revolutions tattoo. 4th movie is just does not making any sense. There were lot of flash backs they should have just make a documentary of Matrix or republish the series on theaters it would have been a lot better. Every scene was referring to previous movies makes me wonder what was the point of this movie? Bringing us back memories? Terrible script I would have done better job. I wish I was joking. I felt bad for Keanu he is a great actor he did not deserve this movie neither did I. Why did I give 2 point well I still do have respect first 3 movies that's why .If I were you I would avoid watching this at all cost as a fan of the Matrix.,2
1914,"Really worst movie in all Matrix seqeul. If there be fifth part please don't let Lana to direct it. No color, green filter where is it; CGI is bad; martial arts weak; no mirrors; in some parts it looks like it filmed with iphone, really WTF. So dissapointed. Actors, in all planet was it so hard to find desent actors, after one hour I coudn't remember actors faces or names: bug, fic or samethink like that.",5
1915,"Why is Trinity more powerful than Neo? The whole point of removing Neo from the matrix is the fact that he is the ONE. The person who changes the world.I appreciate the fact that they ended this movie with more of a happy ending (Trinity and Neo don't die) but they make women the more powerful (the original trilogy didn't have to force feed us female empowerment, it was already there).So the writers decide that they want the females to look smarter, stronger, faster, all the while making Neo and the other male characters look weak and stupid.The only ""superpower"" Neo has is stopping bullets, but he can't fly?The visual effects were good, but this story needed to be better, there were times I kept checking the time to see how much longer the movie was going to be. Parts of the story wasn't needed and some scenes were just straight up bor-ing.The best film out of these movies was the first one. All the rest just can't compare. If you want to watch a great movies series, watch John Wick instead.",5
1916,"Toral rehash - thoroughly disappointed!Just a rehash of the past film(s) and really, really badly done!LF not present and I can see why.Was looking forward to seeing this but I guess that it met my expectations.The original felt so fresh but this is so far away from that!!I think that this is the end of the line for the Matrix unfortunately and this is a real shame as it had so much potential.Not really sure what happened or why this ended up so bad but I live in hope that something better will come alongKR fantastic as always :)",1
1917,"It's almost like the directors of this one never watched the originals ?? There was nothing special about this at all, just like some cheesy action flick with a bunch of soup fighting scenes. This will make you miss and appreciate matrix 1-3 more and you will hate this pointless reboot restart salad even more !!!",1
1918,"Matrix 4 is a bad parody, poorly directed by Lana Wachowski in need of money. Our money.Lana has anything else to say, and even so, she prefers to tell instead of showing us the few, poor, tiny ideas she has..",1
1919,"The glory of The Matrix is just ripped apart. Even Keanu didn't like this crap, I guess. I lost interest within first 20 minutes. The gaming world would start bashing immediately after watching it. It makes no utter sense. Seems like a composite of ""Train to Busan"" &amp; ""Blade"". Except Neo &amp; Trinity, rest of the cast were horrible. Considering the ridiculous storyline and stone age VFX, the introduction a Bollywood actor in it was overwhelming. Her role in the movie didn't blend in with Neo at all. Overall, it is one of the lowest graded renditions of 2021. Let the franchise rest in peace. We were happy with the Trio! We don't need this crap.",2
1920,"Hugo Weaving and Lawrence Fishburne have given new meaning to the popular phrase, ""dodge this"". This ""film"" is vapid, self-serving, and perplexingly awful. Avoid this movie like the humans avoided giving the machines civil rights and statehood.",1
1921,"Really liked the opening premise of how Neo and Trinity are living in the matrix and why they haven't tried to rebel in 20 years, and how Neo programmed a modal to wake himself.Unfortunately as the movie progresses it gets more and more boring with heavy exposition that you poke holes in pretty easily mixed with archived footage from the first movie. Even the most interesting update of the real world since Matrix 3 is that machines are fighting alongside humans now has no follow up whatsoever. Then the third act divulges into pure stupidity with Trinity being the chosen one too now.Brightest spot was Jonathan Groff as the new Smith. Wasn't sure we needed a rebrand of smith but dude crushes it and honestly just a great actor overall.Idk why I had hopes for this movie, just glad I had HBO and didn't spend the money to watch in theaters. Total cash grab nostalgia pumping flop.",3
1922,"Wow, this movie really sucked. Guess the director was forced to make this? Stay away, waste of time! Funny how the word lockdown was featured in the movie. The only good thing about the movie was the opening logo with the trumpets tune playing we all fell in love with with the first matrix.",1
1923,"This film is a montage of various action scenes and a boring story. You spend the whole film wondering when the story will finally get going and become interesting, but you remain disappointed until the end. The action scenes are well done due to the high budget, but the mood and feeling of the originals never comes up. The chemistry between Trinity and Neo is still there, but the new characters are only weakly developed. In particular, the new Morpheus and Mr Smith don't fit in at all and are forgotten by the end of the film. Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne should have been used here, as the original lived from the characters and the atmosphere between them.",3
1924,"The film spends a solid first half of it's runtime commentating on the state of filmmaking, studios, reboots and franchises in which it becomes increasingly apparent that it's just Lana Wachowski using the film as a mouthpiece to bitch to the audience that she didn't want to make the film and the studio forced her to do it. Which is fine but people don't come to watch a Matrix film for a commentary on the state of Hollywood, there are plenty of other films that do that better. The original Matrix appealed to people because of it's exploration of themes such as AI, technology, man vs machine, existentialism, fate, free will, choice etc. Heck over the years as the directors themselves have come out as trans, the Matrix has slowly come to be seen as a form of trans allegory but the new film other than a throwaway line does absolutely nothing with it.Unfortunately the first half is also where she puts the most effort as that's the part she was really interested in, because the 2nd half just feels like a rushed hodge podge of a romance/rescue plot where it seems like the director just realized ""Oh yeah I've still got an entire movie to finish"". The main theme here seems to be that of love but the 2nd half is so rushed that all of Neo/Trinity's development just feels unearned. The film could have definitely used an extra half an hour or more to make their developments more fleshed out.It also doesn't help that the action is also very unremarkable which the the sequels at least excelled in.",6
1925,"Certain things make a good story and I will list the things this thing lacks.1. A GOOD STORY, It lacks the basics....plot, writing, all the things that the entire production team go to school to learn was absent in this.2. A good cast...DEEP FAKE Morpheus in this thing. He can not be replaced. Not sure why Doogie Howser, M. D. was in this thing. HUGO weaving, again deep fake him in if you don't want to pay his salary. YouTubers do it with zero production budgets with better quality than hollywood.3. Age. Let's be real the main cast is too old not believable.4. It's boring! The minute I write a review during the movie it's a wrap.5. You've been warned.",1
1926,"It's so bad. No story and woke af. Techno-bable without coherent logic. No antagonist, only call backs. Cgi- cash grab. Machines are now sentient, not just programs.",1
1927,"Spoilers aheadBad, poor, average, pathetic, cringe, just so badTalked about ruining a legacy, but most people who have seen all 3 wont even watch this.",1
1928,"This is the worst reboot of a franchise ever. The original Matrix was one of my all-time favourite movies, while this one is... meh, better it wasn't shot at all to say the least.The new cast is bad, heroes don't feel alive or meaningful at all. Like no single actor fits on his place at all. The script is a mess, it has no point or an idea of what's going on at all.The story behind it is so weak and secondary, that I can't actually believe Wachowski has signed her name onto it.The graphics are bad at time, you can clearly see where was the UE utilized. The cinematography is so inconsistent, that sometimes makes one think it was shot by random people. Sometimes it's good, sometimes looks like there was no clue behind it.The color grading is one of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. You can clearly see the overintensified masking in some dialogue scenes. Overall it's so inconsistent, that even some same dialogue angles look like they've been shot month apart (which sometimes is a common practice and normally you can't even guess it until you know it was done so).I wish it never-ever existed. It's a shame of a movie.",1
1929,"The structure of how Neo is resurrected plus the video games and the therapist trying to ""cure him"" with blue pills while being the bad guy I wasn't expecting. I thought it was a clever follow-up where the first three were integrated as video games after the rebirth of Neo and Trinity and how Neo's dreams were his past. The therapist being the bad guy with a cat named Deja Vu was also creative. I liked it as much as the first two, but I didn't love any of them. I will say Morpheus shouldn't have been a pixelated version of himself. That didn't make sense.",7
1930,"The Matrix Resurrections is simply the Intellectual Property of The Matrix universe plugged in to the Marvel Flick template. It reeks of the star wars sequel trilogy (particularly The Last Jedi). It has all the same issues of cast, writing, character building, and plot holes so if you didn't like those films, then save yourself the disappointment and take a hard pass on this. If you need more (no spoilers) evidence keep reading:at least 50 too many goofy one-liners. It sacrifices original substance for being culturally trendy.No character building. There are no relatable qualities to any of them, no motivations, no flaws, no greater purpose. I don't even remember any of their names right after the film ended.terrible casting choicesatrocious script (why did any actor sign on for this? The payday of course! $$$ I don't judge them for that though)overuse of the same special effects multiple times in a row. No creative action choreography.constant flashbacks from the trilogy... we don't need to see those because our intent would be to watch all four again, right? Nobody will want to do that now.plot holes for the sake of mentioning familiar names.when it isn't a literal flashback clip, it is a poorly executed quote or remake of an iconic trilogy scene for no good reason.the macro elements of the plot and how the post-trilogy world has carried on had some real potential. However, this film wasn't made to foster creativity, mindfulness, philosophy, ethics and self reflection like the trilogy was. Lana wrote this for a few laughs and a quick buck.all of the wonder and curiosity of the trilogy was omitted and instead this was basically a product placement ad that lasted 2 hours.As a HUGE trilogy fan, the only nostalgia I experienced was in the famous opening chords of the soundtrack. However, everything that followed was a disappointment. I will not be rewatching this movie for any reason ever.",2
1931,"Where to begin. The pacing is sluggish, the script is lousy, it felt like a fanfiction project. As I expected, they have once again ""subverted"" our expectations a la The last jedi. If I could give this movie less than one I would.",1
1932,"Complacently Banal --That pretty much sums up my review of this film. Without giving away any info needed, not what I would call even near the spectacle of what modern filmmaking should be. Even with a budget and talent sometimes people can't punch their way out of a paper bag and that is clearly on display here. Not sure why anyone would worry about making a sequel to this sequel, the buck stops here. There's nothing on display that even insinuates creative gestures in this story, nor does it care about the audience. We must all be really dumb because exposition is here to save us, or we're being given the middle finger by everyone who took pleasure to work on this. We're not missing the point here, it's just that there is no point. This is the exact kind of thing that is insulting to watch, where your mind will slowly melt away from your body and frustration seeps in from all sides.",2
1933,"They're retreading all the same stuff from the first Matrix, but it was done better 20 years ago in 1999. The plot was muddled, the characters underdeveloped, the fight choreography was lazy. It tries to rely too much on nostalgia without any new innovations.The Matrix Resurrections feels like a parody of the first film.",1
1934,Why make a 4th part with a different actor's playing agent Smith and Morpheas! No real twists or even amazing stunts compared to the other parts .The action sequences lacked originality.,2
1935,"Whoever the blue haired chick is that plays the character ""bug"" is literally unintelligible...My wife and and I have not understood a word she has said 20 minutes into the movie... talks super fast, super quiet and with some accent? Um ok. WhateverBugs. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Morpheus blah blah blah blah blah let's go, blah blah blah blahOh ok this interesting. ""Bug"" "" Blah blah blah blah.""This is a giant fail....",1
1936,"This was a comedy of errors. The only reason I have it 1 star was to leave a review so no one else would waste their money to see it. I want a refund 😞. Sad, real sad!",1
1937,"Dialogue's weird, gone all woke, with phrases such as OMG, characters in the game company, very annoying.... it seems like a joke of a film..... doesn't seem to be a seriousness to it. It's weird. Why did they have to get the Chinese people on the train all wearing masks.. surprised they didn't push promotion for the corona vaccine. It's a badly written film, almost pointless really, Matic is a trilogy, this seems like a money grab, or the brothers got bored and wanted to just do something......Matic 1 was a revaluation. This is just bad....",1
1938,"Congratulations, you had the chance to make a good movie but decided to cement what should have been an unwanted description.......The Matrix is now just another series of movies whose chronological order matches the best to worst order.....",3
1939,"To be honest I walked into the cinema with an open mind hoping that this would be a very special sequel to the first 3 movies. Omg was I wrong? The plot is an absolute twisted kerfuffle at best! It left me wondering why the producers, directors and actors (particularly Reeves and Moss) would even bother putting hard work into this mess. Some pretty bad acting too. Particularly from Jessica Henwick as Bugs. She mumbled so much through this movie. She was very hard to understand. All I can say it is destructive towards the other movies which really entertained me. They were the brain child of some really intense thinking but this movie is brainless. So dissapointing!",5
1940,"There are some clever touches - reflections ahead of the story of Neo and Trinity engaged me a lot, and the plot did answer my questions in regard to that.But overall this was very disappointing and, actually, quite a lazy effort.Fight scenes for example, were badly done. Nothing particularly new about them, and the wow factor of the original is entirely missing - but in several shots you clearly see the fake punching where a hand misses, but the reaction and sound is that it hits. That ruins the suspension of belief and is so easily avoided in post-production.Add in some randomly peppered ambushes that add nothing to the story and are clearly there for their own sake, and you are left feeling more irritated than enthralled.It is an hour too long, mostly because the first half is set setting the stage and trying to explain why this movie exists at all. The key points are delivered well enough, but it just takes too damn long. Once the film does actually get going, then the flashbacks and self-references continue and do detract from the pleasure of watching this.In summary, there still only remains one Matrix film.",4
1941,"I am devastated about this movie. I shouldn't have went in with high hopes but even that aside, it's a bad mood. The overacting from the fresh cast is the first thing that plunged my hearing dread. The fight scenes are average at best and the over reliance on flashback scenes from the original is boring and lazy. Best avoid if you hold the original franchise dearly.",2
1942,This movie is so bad written and the CGI and choreography as well.... I don't know what the producer was thinking.... Poor Keanu Reeves in this project so bad executed.The 1 matrix was and still the best the secuels are ok.... We need talented writers from the past.,1
1943,"The first, second and third films are still easy to understand. The fourth film, hm... Until the middle of the film it is still difficult to understand WHAT the story is... It's like seeing a random movie.... Somehow the story is enough to make me open my phone and play games while watching in the cinema... I was quite disappointed because I couldn't enjoy the movie and was as excited as I used to be when I watched it...",4
1944,"I was pretty excited for this film. Matrix is one of my favorite movies of all time and I couldn't wait to see the 4th film.However, I found myself thinking, ""what exactly is the point in this movie..?"" This didn't add anything valuable to the first 3 films. In fact, it almost just seemed like a remake but with less likable characters. Everything they're trying to do in this movie was already essentially covered in the first 3 movies.6/10 cuz I've definitely seen far far worse films but I can't rank it much higher than that as far as the story goes. Seems like it was more just for a cash grab than anything.",6
1945,I thought this movie was a bad idea. And then I watched it and I was surprised: it was even worse than I thought.By then the ending came and changed everything: it was the worst movie I've seen in a long time.,2
1946,Stinker of a movie overlong boring wokey lite festival of repetitive violence ...Keanu was brilliant as ever .. the new Morpheus had no gravitas and the general looked like she stumbled backwards through a hobbit scene.. they have really trashed what was a great trilogy.,3
1947,"Made an account specifically to state my outrage of this atrocity. What is wrong with this current era and dragging gold through mud. I got no aura of the Matrix whatsoever with this, leave the trilogy alone.",2
1948,"It felt like the creators are trying to recapture what made the original so amazing. You can't take what made the first special and try and modernize it into our more digital age 20 years later by incorporating video game feel and VR AI. This goes the same for Blade Runner 2049, although that sequel was lightyears better than Resurrections.",2
1949,"The Matrix IV is little more than a shameless cash grab in the form of a plethora of call-backs. Instead of breaking new ground in any way, shape or form the directors chose to reuse the same tired old gimmicks to the point I felt like I didn't need to bother watching half the movie since I'd seen it all before, right down to the exact same camera angles and fight choreography from the original trilogy.I wasmostly bored and rolled my eyes more than a few times at the lack of effort that seems to have gone into this script. The whole thing was predictable to the point of deja vu.",3
1950,"I normally don't write these, but I really felt I had to - as a huge fan of the original trilogy, although mostly the first movie... This really is a terrible and horrendous, hugely unnecessary movie. If anything, the only thing the movie succeeds to do, is spoil the original trilogy even more than it did on its own. Poor writing, laughable screenplay, and shockingly bad acting from what would be considered a A-list cast. It feels like this was made as some kind of medium for promoting ""diversity and inclusiveness"", as it has been seen with so many film as of late - something that always seem to fail, as it forces the narrative and art of the movies/shows, instead of letting it shine trough naturally.... My one advise would be this: If you are a fan, dont watch this, it will only ruin it for you.",1
1951,I am so disappointed. It is one of the worst films I have ever seen.I don't understand how anyone could come up with the idea of producing such a bad movie.Certainly Lana's last film.,2
1952,"I've tried several times to push through to the end, but just cannot.Uninteresting script, cheap filming with the characters in the action sequences doing blurred motion movements, and there is nothing in the cinematography that is unique, thought provoking, or mind bending like the original trilogy.Doogie Howser, to me, has no place in the matrix, and Niobe gives a cliched performance of an old person - shaky voice and all - because all old people talk with a strained, raspy voice.Even the costuming was flawed. In the originals, originality was a must. Every aspect of the films were truly groundbreaking. Resurrections used sunglasses that look like they were designed by a teenager, complete with the now trendy blue hair to match. The whole set looked too much like that futuristic cop movie with Sandra Bullock and Sylvester Stallone.The movie feels like a cheap ""Made for TV' version of the Matrix made for someone who's never seen the originals. It is both uninspired and uninspiring.Unpolished, boringly trendy, typical.",1
1953,"Part one was mind blowing. Every subsequent rehash including the animated versions have been circling the bowl.To call this latest installment bloated is a gross understatement. 1/2 hour in my attention began to wander. Gone was any concern for the characters. Gone was any desire to work out the convoluted ""logic"" or rules (or lack there of) for this world. I just gave up caring. In a story line where reality can bend and morph into anything and death is no real threat; why give a flying F about thdd red characters or their struggles? When many of said characters only exist to provide tedious stretches of info dumps and ham fisted plot exposition you've got another pointless sequel in a franchise that should have been laid to rest after the awful second. Matrix ""Reloaded"".Good love Keanu for donating a huge chunk of his earnings to leukemia research, but the poor guy just can not act. You could replace him with an ironing board and get the same emotional range. And trust me- I LIKE the guy.Add in the usual - by now VERY annoying- Wachowski clichés; blue hair girl? CHECK!!! Trendy-esque young cast in pseudocyberpunk fashions? CHECK!!!. Wise elders spouting convoluted (and in the end, pointless) ""mystical"" nonsense? CHECK!!! Never ending battle sequences???? (Yawwwn is it over yet?) Add all these elements and you bet you've seen this movie before. You saw it when it was called ""Reloaded"". You saw it when it was called ""Revolutions"". You saw it when it was called ""Jupiter Ascending"". And now it's called The Matrix Regurgitated.Bonus points for the talented special effects crews who do an amazing job considering the overly long, bloated and ham fisted story they've been given to work with.Wachowski has quite a few very creative and unique concepts- some quite dazzling, but she definitely needs a talented story editor, director, and RESTRAINT to bring these elements to life. For the love of God someone tell her ""Less is more.""",3
1954,"My first impression is disappointed. The movie seems like a mess, for some reason. It is almost chaotic in a way.Freeing people seems to be easier now. You don't get fished from the sewers anymore. Great! There are human friendly machines. Nice!However, some things seem meaningless now. For example they don't have to find a phone anymore. That was one of the main aspects of the Agents chasing Neo in the first movie. It was how the movie built tension. Here, they go in and out of the Matrix whenever and wherever they want, it seems.Smith is back - and after beating the Analyst, he just disappears? Why? No fight? Is he too cool to fight now? It feels off-character.Also, in the scene where Neo and Trinity are jumping off the roof, they just start hovering - and badly I might add. It is clearly visible, how they are dangling from threads. It took me out of the moment. Isn't that supposed to be some sort of reveal, that Trinity has powers now? Oh well ...This feels like a setup for more. A lot of new things have been introduced to the world. But I'm not sure if I want more of that.",5
1955,"It's like this movie was made for the sake of it, it had no narrative and no reason to exist. It just recycles everything we've seen prior with the 'meta' factor being pushed at you every given chance.Even with the new actors, why not make them new characters instead of putting them in the shadows of Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne? Which essentially is impossible to do from the original trilogy.I'm only giving it 3 stars. 1 for the movie because you can't do 0, 1 for Keanu and 1 for Carrie-Anne.",3
1956,Matrix trilogy left is mark on a generation. The fantastic story of the alternative future where machines subjugate humankind. The story of what is Real that set the mindset of many. This film is a shame on that legacy. Very sad for it.,2
1957,"This movie is just a bad joke and I don't appreciate this kind of bad humor. I'm expecting to see the real Matrix coming out soon and hopefully, it's probably waiting juuust around the corner.",2
1958,Who dare. Wwhooo dare 😐 highly suggest that you take the blue pill and stay in whatever simulation you're in. No revelation hurts as much as the the realisation you've wasted your time. Stick a fork in it. It's done.,1
1959,"The movie was a cash grab by the studio. A half hearted attempt at adding to the original series. A job for the actors. A bunch of ""Iron Fist"" level fight scenes. A hidden message to Warner Bros. And a complete waste of time.",3
1960,"The start of this movie is still reasonably promising. The first half hour seemed to be a good start to something special. There's also a couple of reasonably good action scenes. The main one, a bike chase through the streets of San Francisco is really well done.I liked the new characters and having watched the TV series ""Sense8"", it's nice for so much of that cast to get another chance to appear for director Wachowski. Keanu Reeves gives an incredible lead performance with plenty of charm and is once again able to anchor the film's more surreal and pretentious moments. He is still the man and looks dashing with his beard and his acting skills are really good. Carrie-Anne Moss is great and has strong chemistry with Keanu Reaves. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is effortlessly cool and Jessica Henwick gives the best performance out of the new characters.The pitfall is that you will struggle to figure out what is real and what is fantasyThere is enough fast paced action to not fall asleep. Oops, my friend did fall asleep anyway!",7
1961,"If you enjoyed any of the previous matrix films at all, then this film isn't for you.The re-introduction is packed full of cringe, and could have been about 75% shorter. This feels like it was written and directed by a large team of 60 year old corporate exec's who who are trying to be hip and meta, and were guided by some buzzwords they read in the report from a twitter focus group.The characters are soul-less and hard to empathise with, 'plot twists' can be seen a mile away, the pacing is terrible, the new rules that are established for the universe are forgotten immediately, and the special effects were underwhelming - especially compared to what was done 20 years ago.The action sequences are uninspired, boring, fail to build any real tension, and are devoid of any point. The soundtrack tries it's best to tell you precisely how you should feel but is out of step with what's actually happening, doing more harm than good.I suspect this film was intended to capture the woke 16 year old demographic who's only exposure to the matrix thus far has been seeing a meme of keanu reeves sitting by himself. I'm certain this film was only made so some new characters could be folding in so they can squeeze another 3 sequels out of it, 2 or 3 spin off tv shows and at least a mobile game.The original trilogy provoked introspective thoughts into the nature of reality and reflection on our selves and the bigger picture. This sequel provokes thoughts of ""who do I speak to to get my money back"".I will be impressed if this films makes half the amount of money it must must have cost to get Keanu Reeves and Carie-Ann Moss to have their name and face anywhere near this film.",2
1962,"Whoever sais to you: ""aaahhh, the movie is ok"" ...unfriend that person. They are not your friends.The movie is just... BAD, AWFUL, BORING. Its not worth the money to go to theater.Speachles, how they try to milk the old milk-cow...in a wicked, shameful way!",1
1963,"Zero Originality in this movie. Cinematics are not done well either. The story is way too predictable and not even original at all.The film is basically hoping for those who loved Matrix 1 to waste money on it.Renting Keanu Reeves is just not enough to get a good movie. Smith was terrible, as was the new ""team"", the new Morpheus, etc. I never cared a single second for either of them.",1
1964,This movie had a lot snippets from the original Matrix which i think they depend too much on it. Everytime those snippets comes i was more interested to those original than this movie. The acting are unnatural. Im in the cinema waiting for this movie to end.,3
1965,"This movie is a combination of movies:Last Action Hero combined with Wes Craven's New Nightmare, and combined with Escape from LA. This movie Shares so much with Space Jam 2. Similar themes.When watching this movie I got the strong feeling that it was almost like a hate letter towards reboots, sequels and Hollywood in general.The first hour felt like a cynical mock documentary on movie-making and how studios force directors to create unnecessary sequels.First hour mocks the older matrix movies, attacks and mocks its own mythology and it attacks the following the first matrix had.It was like a documentary on video game making and the process that a video game company goes through when making a game. Video games play a big part on the story.The second hour of this movie actually becomes like a real sequel to the matrix revolutions. Fully brings the mythology of the older matrix movies and follows the story of matrix 3. Explains what happened after matrix 3.The action is very awful and had a lot of shaky camera. The movie looks very cheap. It felt like a movie from THE ASYLUM. It felt like a low budget parody of the matrix.The cinematography looks cheap. The new bullet time is very awful lookingthe new characters are kind of annoying.Bad acting, annoying characters, awful dialogue. Shaky cam, bad slow mo effects.This is not a real movie. It is not a real sequel. This is a deconstruction of sequels.",
1966,"I was excited for this matrix and I tried ignoring the negative reviews for this movie, but sadly they were right.This movie is full of forgettable characters, a boring plot, and it lacks what made the original matrix game changing and mind altering.If you are a fan of the series you should watch it, but be prepared to be letdown.",3
1967,"SPOILERS!!! Do not pass go. SPOILERS are HERE!!First of all, I see why some reviewers are disappointed. The technology that was used to create the first Matrix has been updated and refined. To many, what once seemed cutting edge is now 'ho-hum'. Because they fixate on that, they miss the meaning. The lesson. Lana Wachowski provides a review of the old to help transition into the new. It is a seamless transition.We have spent the last 22 years immersed in a cinematic world so completely changed and altered by the Wachowskis that it's hard to imagine life before it. BM (before matrix). That change has permeated literally every part of our lives. It is hard for someone who has never experienced the world pre-Matrix to understand the profound shift in the zeitgeist that movie ushered. Thus, these few approach the movie with a jaded eye and are unable to appreciate the subtle shifts that this movie brings. There will be those intent to point out what the movie is not without realizing what it is.What the Wachowskis bring to cinema transcend the visual. They are masters at taking the big set pieces to make you see and question the reality of existence. This is not intended to be the original or any of the ones which followed.SPOILER TIMENeo and Trinity died in the last film. What we have always known about the machines is that they waste nothing. Everything is recycled. Their bodies are repaired and replaced into the power plant (in a special section) and they are reinserted into a version of the matrix. A bit of time has passed. Twenty years or so and Neo (now fully integrated back into the matrix as his alter ego Thomas Anderson) is living and working as a game creator. In this version of the matrix, he has created a game called The Matrix, which takes the events of his real life and made it into game play. He is not adjusting as well as could be expected and he has a therapist (Neil Patrick Harris in sparking blue glasses) who has a black cat named Déjà vu. His therapist prescribes him copious doses of medication (blue pills) to help him adjust to his psychosis. Trinity, meanwhile, has a life as Tiffany. She is married to Chad and has three children. Their lives seem okay and not quite right at the same time.60 years have passed in the real world. A group of humans and sentient machines work together to free Neo. The new human city has machines working alongside humans with General Niobe in charge of the fleet. Neo wants to free Trinity. He, along with several ships, sets out to do this and mayhem ensues. There are revelations along the way, including a redefinition of the zombie horde scenario.Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, I no longer expose myself to the zombie hordes of non-vaccinated-non-mask-wearing-mouth-breathers in a theater setting. I chose to view this at home on HBOMAX. I found the movie satisfying and refreshing. I appreciated that the passage of time was acknowledged. I liked the cameo of the Merovingian, who looked amazingly like the Trainman. I enjoyed the incorporated elements from the earlier films. All these elements helped propel the story forward. The action and fight sequences were exciting. The expansion of the Matrix universe was welcome. I had a really good time watching this film It is definitely something I'm going to enjoy watching multiple times.I highly recommend this film and hope you enjoy the expansion of the Matrix mythos as much as I did.I urge you to see this film, but remember 'there is no spoon.'",10
1968,"I feel embarrassed for the acting crew. The movie was terribly scripted, the plot made absolutely no sense, and Matrix franchise just took a dump. Rather than a resurrection I think they died .",2
1969,"Movie story was slightly boring but I saw this for their outstanding acting skills. This movie is the most reason of Keanu Reeves come back. #GoodActing, #GoodVisualEffects....",10
1970,"Over 2 hours to follow a film without any sense / flavor, surfing for the best scenes from previous films. The fight scenes in this film are so poor that there is no astonishment / excitement compared to the previous films. After 20 years and even if the history of this fourth opus sucks, I would expect better visually.",3
1971,"Sorry there is little more that can or should be said about this film. Another franchise destroyed by Hollywood, another shameful cash grab from Hollywood. Pathetic.",1
1972,"Had low expectations going into this - the trailer showed that a good chunk of the movie would just be clips of older movies - and in that regard it didn't disappoint.Three stars for the techicals. The story though is just crushingly dull.As an aside, am I the only one that whenever I see a review that invokes the word 'woke' I just immediately disregard anything that person might have to say? Being awake is supposed to be a bad thing now?Living is easy with eyes closed.",3
1973,"I liked this sequel better than the other sequels. It was pretty to look at and I enjoyed the cinematography. I liked how they changed the color filter. But yeah, nothing groundbreaking here. More of the same.The first movie is pretty fun. It's silly but a good time. Agent smith is honestly what makes that movie for me. He's an awesome villain. Also, it has an AMAZING climax and ending. Kind of a perfect ending when it comes to cheesy action movies... But, like the sequels after the first, this one suffers from a convoluted and completely unnecessary continuation of the story. The Matrix sequels are what I call ""... and then"" movies. Cash grabs, basically. But I will say I enjoyed this particular cash grab more than the other two sequels. Not sure why... I just got a mild kick out of it. MILD kick. Die hard fans of the franchise are either going to adore it or hate it. Personally, I don't really care. It's a pop corn cash grab flick. And who can blame them for doing it? I don't understand though how so many people can be like ""ITS SO BAD!"" And give it one star. Did you all see the other sequels?!? This one was way better than those sequels. Still, it's not necessary or amazing in any way... nothing will be as good as that first film because they had the perfect ending in the first. That's where it needed to stop... or at least bake in the oven for a few years like Terminator did before T2 came out... and the thing about T2 is that it's basically a reboot, that's why people loved it. Maybe that's why I liked this sequel more than the others, because it baked in the oven for almost 20 years and I had basically forgotten about those awful sequels. I dunno, whatever. I think a lot of people on here are overrating the Matrix because they saw it when they were little kids.",6
1974,"The movie realy tries to take something from the past movies. And realy fails at it, because it doesnt work i guessTechnicaly. It looks good. But who cares, if it just doesnt matter what happens in the frame.Any story has to explore something, to bring something new to the table. This movie Realy doesnt explore anything. I dindnt even understand what its about honestly. Its like joking about itself!?Feels like It started and ended without even moving an inch.What is the sound of one hand clapping?! Would portray well the experience.Artisticaly 2. Technicaly 8. And a lot of minus points for realy not putting anything new in the movie.Overaly 2/10. Not worth watching.The Matrix universe is amazing. And it has such a potencial.A story of something before Neo could be realy interesting. About someone else. Or what if Neo would take blue pill? And run with it. That would have been at least a story!!! Something untold.I guess Hollywood realy dont want to pay money to story writers. And just send hundreds of millions down the drain to random ideas that seem Cool for a second. And run with it. A shallow what ifs. And just smash them together, and its supposed to mske sense. It doesnt.The story. Doesnt make any sense. The scenes bare zero weight! Honestly, It doesnt deserve to be rewieved.Actualy worst movie ive seen this year.To whoever made it. Please stop! :)Sory...Gundars Miks.",2
1975,"'The Matrix Resurrections' is a semi-reboot, coming 18 years after the trilogy was completed. We don't start with Neo (Reeves), but rather Bugs (Henwick), a Trinity-like character and a refreshed-Morpheus (Abdul-Mateen), as they search for Neo in the Matrix. Turns out Neo &amp; Trinity (Moss) are both alive inside the Matrix, but in new simulations, where they don't know each other or their past lives and Mr Anderson just so happens to have created a video game called ""The Matrix"". It gets a bit meta in parts.The film takes quite a while to establish Neo's new normal, with the therapist/Analyst (Patrick-Harris) and Smith (Groff) as his business partner, as well as the new real humans - Bugs and the others that don't really get much screen time. Niobe (Pinkett Smith) is back as one of the survivors of Zion. Once Neo is rescued, it becomes an attempt to free Trinity too. Not really too much to the plot otherwise, for good or bad. Henwick, Groff and Patrick-Harris are good, while Moss feels like a secondary character.One of the main issues is that the CGI on the original trilogy was so groundbreaking, that it now seems run-of-the-mill. There's not much new here in terms of CGI or action scenes, especially after what happened in 'Revolutions' (probably worth a re-watch to those that write it off). Sticks to the core tenet of Neo &amp; trinity's love being able to disrupt the Matrix, but doesn't add too much to the overall Matrix mythology. Definitely not a bad film, just not exceptional. I assume there will be more films...",7
1976,"This is like watching the parody of the Matrix. Meta-analytical chatter of the original ideological principals put forth, done in such an obnoxious way, is truly off-putting. I deconstructed the film as I was watching it; replacing scenes, reveals and character introductions, slower, suspenseful pace, absence of irritating, jarring references. Fight scenes, more meaningfully constructed, more time and beauty. I was in other words re-imagining.Cinematographically, I wanted to gaze, not just glimpse the surrounding scene-scapes. Chaotic, hectic camera work, with limited range of scope made the often dank, dark set design feel under appreciated. In flashes of brilliance,I loved the use of corridors between fight scenes, flitting through realities. This is a clever example of not hyper- extending a fan-led reference.Yet what propped up this movie was absurdly, awful script writing, hammy acting, butchering of characters defined, with awful side characters I did not care about. Also absense of Lawrence Fishburne means one actor's legacy stays unscathed. I just found the cheap knock off version of his mannerisms, his values and his fighting style just poorly conceived.I wanted to see something fresh, not of its time as is the legacy of the Matrix. Yet this feels so on the nose with with it's societal and existential critique. I hated the instantaneous, indulgencies of self-referential labotomizing of its own universe.... Come on... So poor. Literally have retconned this.Stand-outs- Sati just due to there being somewhat a little beauty and pause for breath. But this is pushing it for any sort of compliment.",2
1977,The fact of the matter is you can never revive a franchise these days without a high percentage of fans whining and complaining and complaining reviews. It's as if everyone forgot how mediocre the last two films of the origin trilogy were! No this doesn't hold a candle to the initial movie but it much better thought out and this movie stacks up much better than the two that came before it.I'm starting to believe the internet has become a giant ball of people who simply get their kicks talking negatively about everything under the sun that's not done the way they wanted or expected seen.,8
1978,"... and battles are won but the war never ends. Evil changes terminology but never hides its true nature. Stories of victories are used to repeat the same cycles, that were supposed to be ended by those victories. I think it perfectly fits into the franchise. Most people will not like it, because they need permanent happy endings, to have something to hold on to, in their models of reality, their escape from it. Some will try to weaponise it against people that think differently, showing only that they didn't understand it. I'm pretty amazed this was produced in a time when most people are willing to forego their freedoms for an illusion of security.",10
1979,This is what you get when you let Lana direct a movie.WHY WHY WHY !!!!Why would they release a fourth movie when the first three were perfect?They destroyed everything.,5
1980,"What can I say? I am very disappointed, Mr. Anderson. It reminded me the last Indiana Jones movie, totally unnecessary and pointless. It was like a Indiana was having a nightmare. Just like this movie: Neo's nightmare!",5
1981,"I am CONVINCED the wachowshi's never wrote the original matrix 1 script they probably stole the idea from someone else and claimed as their own. The contrast between this movie and the previous one is LIGHT YEARS away . I mean this movie is soooooo bad., sooooooo bad that it made dragon ball the movie look like a 9/10 and that movie was beyond horrible .Pointless and incoherent plot , misuse of characters , horrible acting , cheesy and cheap one liners , bad cgi , no good fight scenes . Over playing nostalgic moments from the first movie over and over again those not work , you just ran out of ideas.Warning do not watch if you're a matrix fan , I à beyond disappointed.",1
1982,"I rewatched the previous Matrix movies in the 2 weeks prior to seeing Resurrections. In my opinion, the movies are ranked in the following order from best to worst: Matrix I, Matrix III, Matrix IV, Matrix IV, Matrix II. My criteria include things like: depth of character development as expressed in conversation and progressive actions; inclusion of complex ideas and/or moral situations that are difficult to resolve; ambiguous endings (more like real life); internal struggle in characters; multi layered interrelated plotlines; universal relevance; and, of course, nuanced acting, good line writing, camera work, set design, action choreography, etc.I think that this fourth installment failed for me because the stakes were just never high enough. So, as I review that list of evaluating criteria above I find myself thinking that the real problem with the movie lies in either the basic writing--that is the plot construction, not the dialogue--or maybe in the final editing.All the way through the movie, the primary focus seems to be on recovering the romantic relationship between Neo and Trinity. And I suppose that is a fine idea. There are plenty of movies that are basically romantic dramas. But is one romance really worth placing the entirety of the last remnant of humanity at risk? It seems overblown to me. Why would the other humans go along with this?There were a few extremely brief moments in which other, larger scale, concerns were brought to light: The crucial interest that the machines have in maintaining the status quo (keeping Neo and Trinity separated but close). The tense state of peace that has existed between the humans and the machines since Matrix III. However these two issues, which are actually interconnected, are never really given the screen time necessary for them to help elevate the focus of Neo's mission from one that is purely personal to one that could determine the future of humankind.If Neo's mission could have been reframed in this way, I think there might have been a greater sense of importance and urgency for this audience member. A greater feeling that the outcome of Neo's actions and choices mattered....... As things stood, this was not much more than a movie about whether Mr. Anderson was going to ball Tiffany.",4
1983,The concept that I believe they were shooting for was fun but the plot fell through and failed to land. In fact I think the plot blew up like those helicopters... but it was fun at least!,6
1984,"A good sequel for the matrix trilogy and a good opening for future sequels, the thing I love about the movie is lots of noticeable easter eggs which can be easy identified by matrix fans like that cathere and there a blast from the past but sure to understand the movie people must see the trilogy and understandMy Favorite Quote is ""The sheeple aren't going anywhere"" the way he describes people as sheepAnd I like the minor details in the movie the matrix codes shown at the beginning of the movie, the use of the blue pills and DSI thing ""not a spoilers""",7
1985,So disappointing. Nothing consistant in the plot. Nothing new or elevating like in the trilogy so far. I with I would have never seen this nonsense. I am definitely ereasing this part. Matrix stays to be a trilogy.,1
1986,Ran out of ideas. Complete waste of 2hr of my life. It looks like that its been made by Bollywood. I was expecting some musicals after the fight. Lol.,1
1987,"This was just sad for me, they ruined whole point of trilogy and Neo as character... I was quite shocked to see how this movie managed to ruin my previous matrix enjoyment... There was few good moments but for the most part i was feeling sleepy and bored, i was just waiting for movie to end..",2
1988,Good CGI but the story and all was just meh. It's just a rehash of the previous matrix movies. You would think that the writers would try a different idea.,6
1989,"Although I enjoyed this movie. It just barely made it above average. Keanu Reeves tried to make it better, but couldn't quiet make it. Carrie-Anne Moss felt a little out of it. I couldn't get the feel of the Matrix, well it has been 18 years since the last one, maybe I need to go watch them all again. I'd recommend it.",6
1990,Was awfull.....went with high expectations and return very dissapointed...first one from 22 years ago has way better visual effects;and don't get me started on the plot...total chaos and nonsens...awfull.,3
1991,"I love Matrix and I love Keanu! The most!Now, that I have got that out of my system, let me state that I went to see this movie with 0 (zero) expectations, so I won't be dissapointed.And at some point during the movie, I chose to see this movie as a parody. And starting that point, the movie became brilliant. I was the only one in the movie theater that laughed my ass off.I don't think there are too many directors / producers / actors which have the guts to make a parody of their own movie.And if it's a parody, it deserves 10 stars.If not.... than it's a total waste.",5
1992,"Let me say that the story was pretty good and played out ok. The action and plot was above average, but you took the identities and the characters of Neo and decided to make them ""equal"". You had a chance to just make a movie and maintain the integrity and individualism of the characters and you decided to homogenize them. The end was horrid.",4
1993,"I don't know.. Over 2 hours and it feels like nothing new really happend, but it wasn't boring. It's watchable, but a not needed sequel. It left me unsatisfied, but i didn't wasted my time either. I really don't know..",5
1994,"Why oh why was this film ever made? Who green lighted this script? Why on earth did the cast agree to be involved. This film is so bad I don't even know where to begin. Abysmal from start to finish and no even in an enjoyable way. It feels like that catch up episode you'd sometimes get in a 20 episode a series US drama where they play clips from past episodes thinly strung together by some vague, uninteresting premise. Throw the whole thing out!",1
1995,The replicated intro for voicelines and cinematography was so cringy and unnecessary i actually turned it off. I immediately felt as though continuing the film would be a disservice to the original trilogy.,1
1996,I was really bent on visiting the cinema. Unfortunetly the choice is limited because of the pandemic. So I chose The Matrix...I was not expecting to like it particularly. I enjoyed the first one (though I was not so extremely impressed by it as many other people are).

1997,"The second half litterally ruins the whole concept and is a manifestation of true laziness from the director and team.They COULD have written a great story and executed it beautifully with all the latest film-tech. In stead they turned it into a pseudo-zombie chase with no real ending, other than the lovestory between the two protagonists.Sad for a superfan who loved the two first movies and lived with the third, and all its obvious flaws.This is a cash cow and nothing else.",3
1998,"I am part way through my 3nd viewing and there will be many more at my house on 65 inch 4K. So grateful that we have the home streaming option on HBO Max although without a pandemic I would love to see it in IMAX. Visually a treat for my sci fi eyes. But the real treat is the cast first and then the dialogue. Every line, after the initial exposition, had me weeping with the joy of revelation or laughing with joy! This is easily my fave movie this year. I suppose your average soul less swarm bot might rather see something less dense. I suggest sub titles so you don't miss any of the dialogue. I am aiming for no spoilers so I wont say any more except recommending it to everyone old enough to see an R rated movie.",10
1999,"It's appalling. Everything is wrong. The colours, the mood, the tone, the story, the characters, the dialogue, everythingThe original was dark, sophisticated and the directors/writers assume an intelligence of the audience. This one is aimed at dumb people with far too much swearing and flash backs to the previous films.This is none more apparent than when comparing The Architect's speech about what the Matrix to Neil Patrick Harris's speech about the same thing.",1
2000,Nothing to say don't waste your money for it 🔓good action but the acting wasn't that good and I was bored in middle of the movie and the ending was mid I didn't like the movie. Keanu reeves was the best but the other actors didn't deserve to be here.,3
2001,"The beginning was thrilling. I was sooo excited that it started off great. However, the middle and end fell flat. It was an extreme disconnect with the storyline. I thought it was me after I saw the user reviews. Please try again as this is a powerful movie from the first movie-The Matrix.",5
2002,"Okay, maybe I'm kind of biased in that I can overlook the occasional ugly-looking slow motion effects and the constant (if sometimes necessary) heavy-handed exposition dumps that take place over the course of this film. But that's only because there is SO much else that this sequel does right.It's so rare that we see a blockbuster with this much unique ambition. I thought Christopher Nolan was the only one still doing that, but here we are. The Wachowski imagination isn't dead yet.The action sequences are such an improvement over the ones in Revolutions-a refreshing return to form. They feature some truly mind-bending visuals that tell the story through action, and it's always a welcome presence when so much of this complex story has to be told through characters explaining this world to us.Speaking of world-building, here they add quite a bit of fresh material to the machine-infused world of the original films. New technology and imaginative concepts breathe new life into this universe, and I'm excited to see what's done next.The acting is quite a bit better in this film than the previous ones, and the themes are expanded upon in natural, infinitely more human ways! This new story explores love and the power of the human need for passionate pursuits far more effectively than either of the previous two sequels.The film's opening chapter makes some self-aware jokes about how franchise revivals and reboots are what sell nowadays and that tired of hacks keep churning out the same bland media over and over again. But that's not what The Matrix Resurrections is-although it is flawed and falls short of achieving the original's groundbreaking nature, this film is as fresh and I could have expected a forced fourth entry in The Matrix saga to be.",7
2003,"I mean i understand some reasons hard fans giving to hate this movie, but like so many people riding the hate band wagon.. I prefer this fourth installment than the 2nd and 3d movie. I wish all first three movies, the whole trilogy to be remastered. Imagine the original matrix with recent graphical technology which was used for the 4th movie. That would be an eye candy to watch. I think newest movie technology would really help for 2nd and 3d movies to be better, because they were boring to watch. This 4th one - not so boring actually (+i personally like to be nostalgic - i just like that feeling, and this movie is just about that most of it that is, and as i can see many people, A LOT of em just hate that or dont care about nostalgy that much so this movie aint that interesting to them).",9
2004,"I am sad for Neal Patrick Harris. He's in the worst Matrix movie. It could have been so much better. It's a ""meme"" movie as my Son says. I nearly quit watching it, it's only because I'm such a fan that I had to force myself to see how bad it could get.I mean, The Merovingian Dressed like a Jellical cat and just as cringy. Morpheus who's not Morpheus. Old Niobe? Matrix discussion in the film as a game plot. Rehashing bullet time and Zion with the Z and N removed to make the new settlement IO?I really just want to forget this movie.",2
2005,"I went into this with very low expectations after seeing the imdb score. I'm pleased to say I was pleasantly surprised.I loved seeing the old characters and where they end up, especially the crazy French dude yelling critiques at modern society and when agent Smith remembers who he is and yells MR ANDERSON I got goosebumps all over me remembering one of my favorite childhood movies. Nostalgia at its finest.The only real problem I have with the movie is how poor bots are at aiming, the main characters don't even have to try to evade their bullets they'll miss anyway. I mean it's Stormtrooper level incompetence.Is Matrix Resurrections revolutionary as the first installment? No. Is it better than parts 2 and 3? Yes. Well worth the watch.",9
2006,"This one to Forget ,hope the next part regain The Matrix Back to US, this Movie i didn't liked it at all,neo was not our Real Neo in last 3 parts. Agent Smith character didn't convince me.",1
2007,"I guess the title sums up everything. The plot is completely ridiculous, offended my intelligence, seriously. I really wouldn't care much about the action scenes but even the fight scenes were SO CRINGE. Keanu's performance hurt my eyes. He made the movie even more slow than it already were! The photograph director probably came from Netflix because it was unnecessarily bright. Shameful piece of junk.",1
2008,Every once in a while a sequel comes along that's worth 20 years of waiting. Case in point...trainspotting T2 which in my opinion was an excellent film in its own right.This however reminds me of the odd episodes of friends with flashbacks from 8 years earlier when the film quality was visibly worse. Awful movie!,1
2009,"The whole franchise has been ruined, it felt as is there was 5 different writers and they all got to make the movie at the same time.The matrix was a crazy plot with amazing action scenes and special effects, but I have no idea what I watched today was.Can someone please explain to my why the new Morpheus was played as a gay character ?Where are the amazing fight scenes with the twins and training ??Genuinely disappointed they should have not messed with it at all.",3
2010,"Ever heard of the curse of sequels? 1999, The Matrix (IMDb rated 8.3) thrusted boundaries of science fiction and surprised the world with The Bullet Time, breathtaking stories, and mind-bending worldview. Then, Matrix Reloaded - rated 7.2, Matrix Revolution - rated 6.8, and after 18 years since the trilogy, Matrix Resurrection - rated 6.3 (and is still going down). Despite the curse of sequels, Resurrection fails the series in several aspects: tasteless action scenes, plain plot, and repeated themes. Yuen Woo-ping's effort in designing the choreographies for Matrix trilogy, enticing the audience with earth-shattering combats, which Resurrection isn't even close to inheriting. Secondly, the movie is filled with salutes to previous trilogy and explaining conversation which are obviously included to microwave leftovers and confuse or hallucinate the audience. At climax, Trinity decides to abandon her fabricated family to achieve free will, which is another repeated theme from the trilogy. It seems rather clear that Lana's trying to retain her reputation using a sensational icon, but Resurrection is simply an overcooked steak that was at its peak in1999.",6
2011,"Unfortunately, this movie is the worst movie of 2021, no story, no directing or actionThe scene on the train was really bad and it gave me a headacheUnfortunately, the name of the movie and the actors were used to attract movie fansAnd the presence of morpheus was very bad and offends the main hero of the story.",4
2012,"Being a fan of the Original Matrix trilogy. I can say with no hesitation this new film was completely disappointing and really served absolutely no purpose to the original trilogy whatsoever. I thought maybe this film bringing back original characters would serve as a bridge to introduce a new generation of characters to the world of the matrix and possible future films. But to try to continue the growth of two characters who both died at the end of the third film was a very stupid concept.The special effects and fight scenes didn't live up to the past Matrix films, new fight scenes were clunky and not choreographed very well. Compared to the original films, It almost seemed like this movie was done on a B movie budget. Not understanding why Neo moved like an elderly person either? That and the constant use of flashback clips every time anything was mentioned about the past movies got completely annoying and again were not needed. I remember seeing an interview with James Cameron on the making of Aliens and he said when making a sequel, elements from the first film and flash back sequences should not be necessary when telling the new story unless it is to help with a key moment in the film. Otherwise it's just saying to audience ""Ohh hey remember when?!!"" ... well they do that constantly in this film. I've never seen a movie that had so many flashbacks in it. The same goes for bringing back secondary characters from the original trilogy that serve no purpose to the story.Jessica Henwick was the best thing about this movie and is the only reason its not getting 1 star. They could have used this film to pass the torch and its really a shame they didn't let her and the new cast be more front and center for possible future next generation Matrix films.All and all, this film is a true disappointment and shouldn't have been made.",3
2013,"In The Matrix Resurrections, I praised Reeves' performance, the soundtrack, the visual and the sound effects, and the action scenes. All the other elements, the performances (other than Reeves'), story, tone, direction, screenplay, and even the atmosphere, are very very very normal. Nothing is special about them at all. Even when it comes to the story, the person who is watching the movie can feel that there is a huge downgrade if we want to compare it to the previous films and how this film's story does not add anything new to the franchise.But what I really criticized in The Matrix Resurrections is the recast of Morpheus and Agent Smith. It would have been better if the actors Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Morpheus) and Jonathan Groff (Agent Smith) were chosen to play totally different characters because from my own point of view, no actor will be able to play Agent Smith like Hugo Weaving and the impression that he left in us in the previous movies.Also, it can be felt that the actor who played the main villain (Neil Patrick Harris) couldn't play it very well because it was not so suitable for him, his look, his personality, and even the impression that he left in the viewer.When it comes to the score, because of all these flaws, I can't give The Matrix Resurrections more than 5 out of 10.",5
2014,"The fourth installment in The Matrix film series (or fifth if we include The Animatrix) and the sequel to The Matrix Revolutions. This film never was anything like I expected but I respect Lana's decisions and how much this film actually meant to her.First 40 minutes were so exhausting and confusing, but after that it gets it grove back but then again it went full on crazy mode. They used the archive footage of previous films intensely and constantly. The lack of mind-blowing filmmaking techniques were absent and I was expecting something more than this.",5
2015,It couldn't be more bad than this... Very poor effort for such a great movie series.. I'm very sad with how bad this movie was.. Sorry Keanu... By far the worst matrix movie..,3
2016,"This movie has a legacy that it could never live up to. The official was groundbreaking to say the least.However, this movie is a complete let down. Even though I downloaded it illegally, I want my money back. Or maybe reimbursed for my time. Where do I send the bill?About 30% of the movie is a rip of the original, about 30% gets lost in it's own meta, and another 30% is fine action - thus the 3 stars. Oh, and I did enjoy seeing a few of the Sense 8 crew back together.I wish they would have tried to tell an original story here. Instead, the film spends a lot of time trying to explain its own relevance, and ultimately isn't relevant.",3
2017,"Mmm did that taste good. Yes there is a bunch of fan theory in the first part of this movie, which will put quite a few people off. But they did something bold. Completely daring. In some peoples eyes even career suicidal perhaps. They did their best to combine the actual real world. The people that try to make the theories of everything that is the matrix is as well as a new resurrection of the matrix so the story is like a combination of the original series the fan theory community as well as an entirely whole matrix and combined them all at the same time. And the writer i have no idea who it is massive props. The biggest hero of this new matrix in my opinion is whoever wrote this story. Just wow. This movie is a 8.5 but due to adding the theorycraft which will put quite a few non hard core fans off i dropped it to a 7. Still amazingly done. Wow just wow.",7
2018,"If you like your movies with a bad story, a horrible script, terrible acting. Long and boring then this movie is for you. As another reviewer mentioned they should have titled it the wokterix. Honestly, I was a big fan of the original, but this movie is just bad to the core. It ruined the franchise IIMHO.",1
2019,"We just got garbage. I fell Asleep multiple times. Just trying make money. No artistc value. Look sequels often do not work, mostly to many changes. Starting with cast and director, here same director and writer. Alittle change in characters. Not big changes but another of disjointed. I was blown away by the first one. Extremely dis appointed by this.",1
2020,"Didn't the director watch the movie after shooting it? I literally burst out laughing while watching it. The movie is way below my expectations. For a Matrix fan like me, it was a real disappointment. Very sad indeed.",3
2021,"The only purpose of this movie is to make a woman replace a man as the one, which is kinda lame. I do like neo and trinity characters, but the rest of millennial cast are just tacky and poor actors. Story is kinda old and repetitive. The original movies were way more entertaining. It reminds of of millenials remaking 'do they know it's Christmas' song, and it was a total failure.",3
2022,Seriously I wanted to cry. Lame fights bad dialogue.No mystery No car chases. Weak. Lot of original film scenes were used. Fall asleep to it. I don't think I will ever rewatch this one.,5
2023,I went into this movie not expecting much. The first Matirx was phenomenal the other two were awful. Just boring af. So I wasn't expecting much from this. And it definitely met my expectations. Just boring and stupid. Skip it.,2
2024,"Waited for 20 years for a sequel. I'm one of those guys who's NOT saying ""oh my god they are making a sequel, or oh god they're remaking it and that""! I've watched dozens of movies, I'm an 80s born so there has been time. But honestly I don't care if some masterpiece of a movie like Matrix, or Indiana Jones, Terminator etc gets yet another sequel. I'm more like yayy bring'em on! If they're making a sequel to The Godfather, I really DON'T CARE! If the story and actors are good, why are u people complaining?!When I heard about Matrix 4, first thought was, I hope it has Keanu Reeves and also what more could they possibly tell when much about everything was told in previous 3 movies. Well it has Keanu Reeves, I don't need anything else. Neither should u!",10
2025,"As many of you, if not all, I've been a fan of the Matrix film franchise throughout the years since it came out. I dived deep into the whole Matrix universe, from the plot to the production aspects, everything. I remember saving all my lunch money for a week in order to buy The Matrix Revisited DVD that came out around 2001. Yes, I've been a matrix pot head since I was a kid and what I always found interesting and weird about the entire Matrix universe, are the creators themselves, The Wachowskis....It amazed me how 2 siblings managed to create such an amazing film without prior experience (They directed just one movie before The Matrix, BOUND), and the fact that they were refusing to give interviews to any other people outside of Warner Bros caught my attention, why?.... Because, if you create such a groundbreaking piece of art, a landmark of the field you work on, Why would you refuse to give interviews to any outside source aside from your production company?.... why only appear on Warner Bros conducted interviews? All of these questions, combined with my curiosity and obsession with the film, led me to some deep rabbit holes.I started digging deeper and deeper, researching about previous projects of the people involved in the film, reading production journals, magazine articles. The deeper I dug throughout this, I came to realize that The Matrix trilogy wasn't just an idea from two people, there was a lot of people involved in this, not only on the production but in the script, plot and themes of the films. This information led me to a Theory, which it's just my opinion.... and I always liked to discuss this theory with my friends, this is the first time I post my theory on an internet forum.My theory is that The Wachowskis aren't really the creators of The Matrix films, not even the directors. Lilly Wachowski was always into comics and drawings... so maybe she was involved in the storyboards.... Just maybe. All The Matrix trilogy is a huge collective work and very reserved and anonymous, What I'm saying with the word anonymous is that the people involved with this idea did not want to be featured.... It's not an idea from one individual, or two individuals or three... It's an idea from a group of individuals... a highly creative work from a group of very creative people. And I think The Wachowskis were just featured because the films just needed a name. The people involved in this were probably saying something like... ""The audience and the film industry are going to need a name, someone responsible for this, someone to point fingers at when people ask Who Created This?""........I saw the movie last night, and I have to say this confirmed all the thoughts I had for the last 20 years. I could tell that THIS movie was indeed made by a Wachowski because it resembled Speed Racer, Jupiter Ascending and Cloud Atlas throughout all the runtime. (btw, many people think that V for Vendetta was directed by The Wachowskis, it was directed by James McTeigue, look it up)Matrix Resurrections is horrendous, Basically it's Lana Wachowski making fun of the franchise she was paid to put her name on 20 years ago, at least Lilly Wachowski had some respect for the films and decided not to be involved. But the fault of all this is from Warner Bros, They wanted a 4th installment of the Matrix because by contract they still hold the rights for everything regarding The Matrix. But also The Wachowskis hold a portion of the creative rights which means that if both parties did not collaborate, this was going to be settled down in court, with Warner Bros having more chances to win.Anyway, if you really love The Matrix like I do... Take this movie as a stand-alone tribute project, nothing more.",1
2026,Sad excuse for a matrix movie lost interest halfway through the choreography was slow and not appealing leave the series where it lay and dont resurrect.,1
2027,"Sad.. really poor story, acting and special effects :/So bad that we had to stay and see again original Matrix so remove this from our heads.And it's all because of the director...",4
2028,"It's been 20 years and people just will not shut up about The Matrix. You might expect slick remix The Matrix Resurrections to be just money-grabbing nostalgia, but it's also a comment on money-grabbing nostalgia, a refinement and updating of the original film's ideas, and an exasperated clap back to anyone who missed the damn point these past two decades. With guns. Lots of guns. And even a few jokes. The Matrix Resurrections is out now, in theaters and on streaming service HBO Max. This visually arresting sci-fi flick arrives as the omicron variant threatens, so you need to make an informed decision about visiting theaters. Be sure to check guidance and restrictions in your local area. If you prefer, you can stream the film at home -- shades and leather coats optional. Keanu Reeves returns as Thomas Anderson, a computer geek living an unfulfilled life and haunted by the idea maybe nothing is real. Strange signs and portents keep showing up in his life, forcing him to make a choice whether to step out of the numbing safety of mundanity or seek a dangerous uncharted path involving something called... The Matrix. The Matrix 4 is very much a reset to the beginning of the series, not just harking back to the first film but reliving and remixing it, turning it upside down and poking at what's inside. Original writer and director Lana Wachowski returns to the world she created with sibling Lilly Wachowski (who isn't involved this time), and the new film feels almost like a director's commentary on the original. As the original trilogy expanded, Resurrections shrinks down tight to essentially a love story. The further it gets from that driving motivation, the middle of the film wobbles off course without a clear sense of direction, threat or urgency. So by the end you'll surely be rooting for Neo and Trinity, that perfect big screen pairing, to kick the Matrix's ass again.And then maybe people will shut up about it. But probably not.",9
2029,"Like all movies, this one too works on an emotional level, and your willingness to relate to the characters in the film and their cinematic treatment. For me, this is a standout Keanu Reeves performance. He's vulnerable, unsure, uncertain, and so likeable. I found myself looking at him again and again, and really seeing an older version of Neo, and that happened instantaneously for me. It also helped that I really liked the snappy visual language of the film, superb lighting, great editing, and fabulous action choreography. Hollywood filmmaking skill in all its glory - so many many pieces coming together.That said, this film is bathed in a sort of nostalgia about Matrix 1999, and it is an earnest paean to the first film, and keeps referring to it, and its reception and follow up in a very literal way. So unless you're interested in delving into Matrix I, and what followed it, and what audiences expected, I think a lot of Matrix Resurrections will be strange and unintelligible. So I'm not sure that it works as a standalone action movie! Hard for someone like me to know, since I'm a pretty avid Matrix I fan.I liked all of the performances in the film. Perhaps the one that left me feeling a bit cold was Carrie-Anne Moss', which surprisingly didn't really work for me. I found her a bit remote, aloof, and disconnected. Unlike in the earlier films, where she consistently delivered emotion and poignance. So perhaps with a stronger performance from her, the film would have worked better. That is my only real critique.Technically, I loved this rendition. I loved the costumes, the music, the lighting, the editing. Even the CG was pretty decent (although not great, still a bit heavy-handed, like Matrix II and III). For me, the transition to the machine world was always the weakest part of the earlier trilogy, it just didn't feel as real as the depiction of the matrix (with a lower case, the simulation that the machines have made for humans) itself was - as in, the first film spent the most time in the matrix itself, and I loved that, but wasn't a big fan of the real world depiction. Still holds true with Resurrections, I still don't really like the real world they've built.I always felt that the aesthetic and dramatic differences between the matrix (with its stylish visuals, the underground rave vibe, a sort of chic 60s vibe) and the real world (earth tones, a subterranean world, huge amounts of CG and relatively little modern cultural or historical anchoring) made for an uncomfortable mix within the same movie, and that's still somewhat true here for me.But Resurrections worked for me. I loved how they slowed things down, had a polished and intelligible script with no obvious flaws, spent time with each character and didn't descend into needless orgies of action. Even though there are plenty of those, there's still dramatic reasoning through it all, at least for me. As a Matrix fan, I really enjoyed this film.",10
2030,"Enough with the trolls. You're just sad and unappreciative. I guess you're getting so many free new movies that you don't see the positive anymore??? I was thrilled the teo were back and...also loved the rest of the characters. NPH really made the show. Not because who he is but he was an essential character for the movie.Also loved the last bit after the credits. ""Meow""! Hahahahaha!HAPPY NEW YEAR!",10
2031,"#MatrixResurrections felt like... a stretch, trying too hard to add to the mythology narrative. Fans definitely would appreciate it overall but it's like meeting an ex-girlfriend who parted ways on good terms. The warm ashes remain but the flames have long burned out (3/5Scales)",6
2032,"I feel violated, like they didn't even bother cutting the guy's hair so that he could still film the more important John Wick, and do Matrix 4 between shootings. Conversations long and boring, I swear I fell asleep on the first Neo and Trinity sitting conversation in the coffee shop. I couldn't get past the first fight after he's offered the red pill. Just a complete fraud of a movie, and I'm so upset that after 19 years, this is the Netflix-like, cash-grabbing, soulless, garbage we get. Shame on you guys.",1
2033,"The first three films were amazing. When lanas sibling refused to work on a fourth film, they should have cancelled it, right there and then. Trinity being a drive for neo was influential in all the films, but the man could control sentinels outside of the matrix. There is more to him than just her. After the first (what felt like 40 hours, I'm told was 40 minutes), I was almost asleep in my chair. The rediculous attempts to be meta were infuriating and poorly written. I think its important that Warner brothers come out and de-cannon this garbage. Sell the disc for people who did like it. But accept that this movie is not consistent in ith the others and you can't have a matrix movie without both siblings writing it.",1
2034,"I watched it twice, as I think every Matrix fan should.The first time was in an IMAX theater and I enjoyed it. Action scenes were good, storyline was good but I'm not real sure I was fully following it. I left with some questions as to why certain things were done in the ways that they were. I had read some reviews before seeing it that first time and I disagreed with some of those reviews and agreed with others but all and all I had enjoyed it enough... I then watched it again on HBO MAX and that's when I really enjoyed it. I had more of a grasp on the story line and a lot of those questions I had after the first showing were no long there and this were making themselves more clear and I disagreed with a lot more of the not so good reviews.. It's a fun movie with a smart storyline. I'm welcoming to another if they chose to do another one. I'm sure I'll see it a few more times and throw it in the mix throughout the years when revisiting the Matrix...",9
2035,Why? Why would you make a movie like that? Why you have to force Trinity as the One? Why Keanu makes those movies? Why he never change his hair? Why Warner Brothers say Yes? Why they make this movie? I don't know why they change the choreographies of the fights? Why the change the color of the Movie? Why they want us to sell the Woman as a Hero? Why they don't make a new movie with a new Story where the woman is the hero? Why they want that the women are all what they hate about men? WHY?,1
2036,While the nostalgia was cool it was more based on passing a power to a woman than anything is what it seemed like. All the main characters except that weak Neo where women if you hadn't noticed and neo of course had to pass his power to the Trinity to be the one still if he even is the one still.... Just overall disappointed it was more made for the now society than anything to prove that girls can do anything just like men which I fully respect but at the same time don't ruin my movie over it. Highly disappointed and seemmed more like a cash grab than anything with it'scheap graphics and even more cheap writing and cheap directing. I can't believe they got Keanu Reeves to sign on for this trash. I hope he at least got paid off this. Plus a lot of big name actors like Mr Smith and Morpheus were dropped and added with new actors to replace them like Neil Patrick Harris which who I love but at the same time disappointed me. I truly wish they'd never made this movie all it did was ruin the matrix even worse than three did.,5
2037,"When I first heard ""The Matrix Resurrections"" was going to happen I think I had the same question as everyone else: ""Why?""It's not like ""Revolutions"" ended without questions, but at least there was some sense of closure and we could leave this world behind.That being said, I was absolutely curious about this movie. Why? Because of something quite interestingThe entire Simulation Theory portrayed in The Matrix has evolved and developed into a mental sickness (if you don't buy into that) since the first movie was put it into the mainstream.So, one of the original writers revisiting the original concept benefited from 20+ years of evolution, investigation and conceptualization about this theory plus the personal changes Lana Wachowski has gone through was highly interesting to say the least.Does the movie go there? Mmm... Yes and no. Neo is trapped again in The Matrix, living life feeling something is off and not being able to tell why, like we briefly were told in the first one but now, more developed, with more rhythm and really interesting dialogs that dwell deeper into simulation theory and the existential philosophies that surround the human mind, that along superb performances makes that part highly entertaining and interesting.We start to wonder if anything really happened, if maybe the entire Matrix concept was really a project dreamed up by a creative mind, we even -as an audience- start to wonder if we're not actually in The Matrix seeing the real world unfolding in front of our very eyes through the silver screen. This is incredibly smart and involving.Alas, this doesn't last that long and we go back to lazy writing followed by lazier action sequences and distracting actors replacing well-known and beloved actors because... reasons.I wish Resurrections had not been afraid of going deeper, smarter, even if we don't get it right away. If it made a little bit of sense we would have came back watching it on stream time and again to try and understand it because that's what great works do. They make you keep coming back for more.Maybe the reason we cannot get an entirely great Matrix film is because we don't have the processing power in our simulation yet.Also why is Trinity not kicking ass until the 3rd act?",7
2038,"As a teenager who grew up with The Matrix (1999) and seeing it as a magnificent movie i have to say that i am beyond disappointed with this cash grab of a movie, they tried to make something quick and not spend too much, the franchise did not deserve this abomination, for the first half an our i actually thought we were being pranked or something, like this is a parody, i kid you not this has been the worst movie that i have seen this year, Keanu Reeves seems like he is dead and his body is just moving and acting, That is NOT Neo. Disappointment......Disappointment....",1
2039,"What describes this movie best is the line ""pure garbage"". I cannot describe how bad i feel for Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss! They even slided a line in the movie which stated ""Warner Brothers can ressurect whatever they want, with or without us"".. Well they did just that! ALL FOR THE $$$$ ?? Terrible! Even so, LANA WACHOWSKI failed so hard, i don't even know from where to begin. The matrix will forever be a trilogy for me, this misunderstanding never occured for me. Everything, i mean everything in the movie was terrible!!! And this is from a diehard matrix fan :)",1
2040,"Coming back to this franchise after so many years does not feel like a gap in time but rather a blip in it. It felt like only yesterday when the original 1999 ""Matrix"" movie released. ""The Matrix Resurrections"" - which I saw in theatres earlier today - transported me back in time, to literally another time inside the actual Matrix.Directed by Lana Wachowski with David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon joining her in the writing room, this movie came to life in a handful of interesting ways. The changes they made to it might irk some fans - it did me. I felt they took the right step in a creative direction but, at some point, they lost their way.Playing Thomas Anderson, aka Neo, was the unquenchable Keanu Reeves who did what justice he could to this role, one that elevated his status as a multi-talented artist. To say it was nostalgic watching him revive - and quite literally, because he does indeed come back to life - his character would be putting it mildly.Tiffany, aka Trinity, played by Carrie-Anne Moss brought back rich memories. She was amazing, except for the part where they gave her 'cheat codes' to gain the powers Neo worked and suffered so much to wield.Jada Pinkett Smith gave a stunning comeback-performance as Niobe - amazing aging makeup. It was also nice to see Lambert Wilson cameo as The Merovingian, though severely fallen from grace.They made a major Morpheus character-redesign, giving the 'augmented' role to Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who came really close to filling the large shoes left by Laurence Fishburne. Bear in mind the original Morpheus perished in the real world, outside the Matrix. The new Morpheus (Yahya) 'woke up' from serving as an 'Agent Smith', a plot-point I found a tad over-wrought and a bit contrived, until he clarified everything to Neo later. Alas, Yahya spent so much of his screen time as a CGI character.The new villainous Agent Smith was played by Jonathan Groff. I must admit he was good but lacked the gravitas Hugo Weaving brought to the original character. The Agent Whites were also good, but again, Hugo's absence definitely left a large void.A new character Bugs - an overt allusion to the 'white rabbit' symbolism that prevailed in the ""Matrix"" franchise - was fresh on the scene. Jessica Henwick did great work as Bugs in ""The Matrix Resurrections"". Christina Ricci's cameo as Gwyn de Vere was alright. Priyanka Chopra Jonas as Sati - the little girl Neo met in that 'purgatory' subway station oh-so-long-ago - made my day.Neil Patrick Harris was interesting as The Analyst. I didn't expect to see him turn evil, nice misdirection there - and since when did his cat become a 'Horcrux'. The Analyst definitely lived up to his title when it came to the part where he explained how he brought Neo back to life. But he was far from a figure who could wield 'programming power' to strike fear and uncertainty.A handful of new supporting characters attempted to strengthen the quavering thrill and entertainment value that was gradually starting to erode ""The Matrix Resurrections"". All the 'real world' people did good work on this project, by the way.Neo later learned (from the Analyst) that he was resurrected from death (he perished in ""Matrix: Revolutions""). He 'woke up' in the 'real world and, before long, chose to re-enter the 'simulation world' of the Matrix to try and save Trinity. He followed Bugs (i.e., the White Rabbit) down a new hole, one filled with dark possibilities and maddening implications. Apparently, the Matrix still had a few trump cards left to play, and Neo still believed he could make a difference to end its machinations. But his aim was off.I liked the clever way in which they made 'sleeping' Neo believe that all the 'Matrix moments' he experienced before were just sequences in a best-selling game he designed, and for which he was being celebrated within the fake Matrix. I also liked their choice to name the Analyst's black cat Déjà Vu. The blue/red pills received nifty new designs. They replaced phone booths with mirrors, which was curious.They maintained the Sentient machines as enemies, which was a wise decision - too much deviation from the original would've been a bad thing. They also explored the machine world in more detail, which I appreciated - always wanted to know more about how that place looked and functioned. The entire design of 'Io' was spectacular. The idea of 'Synthients' working with the 'awoken' people was captivating.Try not to blink too often or look away too frequently, because Lana Wachowski inserted a few 'quick' frames - Trinity's reflection on the ebony coffee table not being who Neo actually saw, Neo's own aged reflection in his bathroom mirror, and so on. She conveyed such moments through reflections, mostly, adding to the Matrix-y symbolism found throughout the franchise.Other kinds of symbolism in this movie prevailed, like the Analyst's blue-framed spectacles associating him with the blue pill that made a person forget they were living in a simulation. And Bugs's blue hair indicating that she was (probably) pretending to be like everyone else, or she was aiming to keep Neo comfortable in her presence by connecting him to the familiar fake world in which he was still semi-lost. Her blue-tinted glasses probably indicated Bugs's ability to see through and past the fakery, and onto the real thing. Morpheus's red shirt and tie when he offered Neo the pills again... The observations go on.The noir theme was sporadic, which took plenty away from the anticipated look and feel of the film. Remarkable musical scoring by Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer. I loved Daniele Massaccesi and John Toll's cinematography. All of them ushered waves of nostalgia but even their efforts couldn't quite translate cliché into originality.The art direction and production design teams rose to their individual challenges. Much the same can be said about editing, stunts, VFX, special effects, hair-makeup, and set decoration. Along with Tom Davies (the eye-wear was superb) and Lindsay Pugh on costume design (shoutout to all of Morpheus's outfits), ""The Matrix Resurrections"" earnestly re-designed some of the best characters to grace this franchise.The fight scenes, though noteworthy, did not feel quite as intense as what came before. Only a few sequences in ""The Matrix Resurrections"" could be called gripping. The story failed to hold a candle to the ones that came before.All in all, it was an okay revival, a passable follow-up. There was no legitimate conflict, sadly, and the path to the finish line was a tad too easy. The final forty minutes of the film held slightly more entertainment value than the ones that preceded it - the movie was two hours twenty-something minutes in toto.I did not enjoy the clichéd direction Neo's newest journey took. It routinely felt underwhelming to me. For one thing, the film ran more like a selfish teenage love story than a selfless hero's journey of enlightenment through which he shatters the shackles of his own suffering - the latter was what Neo embodied in the previous films.In keeping with this cliché, the supremely powerful Sentients arrived in large numbers too late, like fictional yesteryear cops to the scene of a crime. The concept of unleashing a 'Swarm' instead of using the original 'Agent clones' was a poor creative decision.Near the end, Neo did not even get the honour of 'saving the day', rather the two villains - the Analyst and Agent Smith - hashed it out, somewhat mirroring the Sentient cross-mecha war for energy scarcity, a topic that was only grazed in the movie and barely explored. No pun intended, but I plugged myself out of the Matrix at around this time.Throughout this overly lengthy film, Neo barely had time or room to be Neo. Trinity, on the other hand, magically channelled Neo's inherent powers with no fan-pleasing plot-foundation established for her to do so. I never thought I would yawn when I saw Neo use his powers to stop bullets and create energy fields, but alas.Some fans, myself included, won't go celebrating ""The Matrix Resurrections"" as intensely as we did the former titles in this franchise. I liked watching what Lana Wachowski brought to this one, but let's face it, the ""Matrix"" franchise ended with ""Revolutions"".",5
2041,"THE MATRIX: RESURRECTIONS is baffling- it opens a Pandora's box which, by the film's own admission, never needed to be opened. Unclear which ""meta"" was satire and which was true commentary. Nice to see the gang back together with some fresh faces, but a muddy watch overall.",6
2042,"The first time ever I skipped all the bad reviews to find the 10s. I'm usually looking for an opinion opposite of mine and man was it hard finding some positive reviews! Watch the movie if you have HBO, otherwise don't give them anymore money. They found a clever way to bring back the two leads and after that you are put through two hours of people asking questions that everyone else in the scene has the answer to. If you like puzzled face acting then this is the movie for you. I love to rant about this more but that would involve spoilers. Off the top of my head I enjoyed Transpotting 2. Otherwise I'm grasping at straws at 20 year old sequels that I liked. ...I really really want to talk about my dislikes so please leave a comment If you'd like to hear them.",1
2043,"I can't believe how bad this movie really was. I don't want to ruin it for you, but it's by far one of the worst movies I've ever watched. Hell, I watched Sharknado in its entirety. Woke as hell.",2
2044,"It's a pretty common opinion that the Matrix series got exponentially worse with each installment and the forth movie continues that trend. At the start of the movie it showed a little promise and doing something a bit different, something more than just adding more and more effects shots. One of the biggest disappointments of Matrix Revolutions was that ended in a way which left it ambiguous as to whether Neo's exploits achieved anything worthwhile at all. It also left a tantilising hint that perhaps the so-called real world was just an extention of the simulation within the matrix. This movie touches at least of first of these questions (it seems that Neo did bring peace) and second question seems to be answered in the negative. The problem with the real world not also being a simulation is that it doesn't explain how he blew up robots in the real world.After a little initial interest this movie just becomes boring as it focuses on the relationship between Neo and Trinity. Frankly this relationship was never particularly interesting in the first place and hence was a weak premise to base the rest of the movie on. Other than that there there are some not so supple references to the abysmal state of modern politics, but it's very superficial and doesn't have anything new or interesting to say.Don't waste your time with this film. If you love action it'll bore you. If you love in depth intellectually challenging stories you'll also be disappointed.",1
2045,"The film is very mediocre. They should not make a fourth film. The atmosphere of the film is reminiscent of a low-cost film made by fans of the trilogy. Smith is only one. It can not be another. Since Hugo Weaving could not take part in the film, they should not have included the character of Smith. The trilogy was a magic movie, the atmosphere was magical. In the fourth film there was no magic even for a sample. For me personally the Matrix movies remain three. Score 4 just for the name of the movie.",4
2046,"This fourth film in the franchise is a bold reboot, precisely because the producers decided to abandon the old formula and baseline plot, and go for something different. In that decision is both the appeal of this movie but also the source of disappointment among so many who loved the original trilogy.How can conflict arise from the declared peace that ended the third installment? Unless the people foolishly decide to break that peace despite the hopeless odds against them, or the machines do what the logical construct disallows, and lie, any plot about a renewal of the same machine vs people war loses credibility.So, the movie's conflict has to be rooted in a different structure, a different focus and origin. And this is the new path this reboot decided upon.Call this review one that appreciated the bold effort, while properly seeing the production qualities and special effects remain top notch.Does the rebooted narrative strike the right chord throughout? No, there are times the movie bogs down in its own efforts. Thirty minutes could have been trimmed off the final edit and the plot suffering none for it. Or, the half hour used to flesh out more original points, or invoke more original characters and their actions.Then there is the new take on ""smart bombs"" near the end of the movie, which seems perhaps a desperate reach to forge a message, that seems entirely lost in its translation.The movie scores an A for effort and originality, but a C for narrative. It doesn't appear as good as it could have been, as if the producers ran out of steam and decided to go with what they had.In the end, it's a much better than average movie, but it certainly isn't the instant classic that most people would have expected and certainly wanted.",7
2047,"Total waste of time and money. Bad movie. Total disregard for the trilogy. I do not recommend. They try to make a movie with no nexus. The history is poor, the actuation is poor. They managed to successfully destroy a franchise.",1
2048,"I'm disappointed at this version of the movie. This 4th edition was just simply boring barely action comes towards the end. Yes, I understand the dialogue is important but holy crap there's so much dialogue that I literally fell roughly 20 minutes asleep in total while in the cinema theater. I'm being generous giving it five stars.",5
2049,"We watched the new Matrix Resurrection last night. If you want an honest review for this 4th movie of the series, look not further than The Matrix Reloaded from 2003. In this movie Persephone says, ""Terrible. Forget it.""",1
2050,"Simply ruined every concept of matrix trilogy in my mind , terrible acts , terrible every thing, they simply assassinated my youth age idol !Do not watch, if you wanna keep your memories of Neo , Morpheus ,trinity ,...why ? Why in the hell guys !",2
2051,"Matrix Resurrections is very meta in two ways: it self references much of the Matrix franchise but mostly the first Matrix movie via various clips and cameos. And then it also references how the Matrix might have been like for the Wakowskis to create it: video games, spin offs, meetings with Warner Bros executives about a Matrix 4. Fortunately the meta quality works for the narrative and doesn't get confused about itself or schmaltzy like some meta movies might. While eventually the repeated clips might have you started to wonder about pandemic budget cuts I don't necessarily think it was so overdone.What really caused confusion for me was the various new tech (ally robots from the matrix world?) and how that came to be and why exactly it works beyond new marketable toys to make. And then the whole story with the new Architect and his plans and the intervention of a familiar agent. What? Why?The Matrix Resurrecrtions adds an element of reality check to the effect of The Matrix philosophy: is it eye opening, or does it cause insanity and mental breaks? What really is the consequence of introducing the idea of a binary ""real"" and ""fake"" world?I like how Resurrections brings the unease of quantum leaps to the surface. However while it also solves the conflict by introducing the idea of synthesis rather than rejection, how it gets there is unclear and relies upon Neo's quick assimilation into his old self and his old ideas. This is a problem because it was strongly established that Neo was ""bluepilled."" It doesn't quite work that he could question his perception so strongly and then revert so quickly.Matrix Resurrections is perhaps more of an epilogue to the Matrix trilogy rather than a true fourth chapter. It deals with the aftermath of the Matrix films for both the audience and the film creators. It is a lighter, funnier film, though also at times begrudging it's own creation. I appreciate the film as a meditation on The Matrix's impact and the failings of its own ideals. With its many clips the film is as much reminiscence as new content. I think it's a good film for fans to enjoy and makes no pretense at being as landmark as the first or second Matrix fils.",7
2052,"Hopefully this is the last one of the ""series"". So painful to watch this after what was one brilliant movie with mediocre sequels. Better if this was titled The Matrix: Resolution.",2
2053,"I was so excited before I went to the theatre, but once I was there in the hall, it was disappointing and angry.Story: PoorExecution: PoorPutting your hopes to the grave: Excellent.""The Matrix Triology"" are a set of movies, which I might have watched a 100 times. This one, I am not going to watch twice.I will just leave it here.",4
2054,"Ok so I liked some parts of it. The new city built. About how some sentients started to side with humans. Story on what happened after the climax of matrix 3 on how they patched up neo. Sati reveal. But mostly I felt it was just non sense. Let me know what you think. It's been a long time I watched matrix, so my logic might be off in some points.-What's the point of the movie? Neo is being hidden by the machines. Ppl save neo. But neo wants to save trinity and then they go and save trinity-Woke culture of trinity also gaining powers like neo. Ok so anyone can become THE ONE (I know the one is actually agent smith, I meant the one like in the one anomaly) now?-If the analyst's message of keeping them both neo and trinity together (but not completely, just close enough apart) is powerful enough to save the matrix? Lmao. Then why keep all the other humans (who actually give power to the machines). Just keep neo and trinity in some house together-And when analyst said the previous relied on equations and facts and not on the human mind, I was like wtf. Didn't agent smith literally explain to morpheus in 1st part about how the 1st matrix failed because they gave humans too much freedom and then they understood the human psyche and built the matrix where they suffer so that humans believe its real and hence matrix became stable?-And why would machines fight with each other for energy? Aren't they like one mind? At worst, they would transfer their energy to one another to last as long as possible to build something to get constant energy back.-Butchered one of my favorite characters in the franchise The Merovingian!There are so many non sense logical stuff in this movie I can go off on. This movie shouldn't even be THE MATRIX!",6
2055,"One of the most non-sense movie ever produced.The question is really: why anyone would even mind to produce such an useless movie?The original Matrix was probably one of the best movies ever produced; the 2nd and the 3rd were already useless, but this goes even further.",3
2056,The title of review says it all. Literally makes matrix 2 and 3 seem better than the original. Couldnt of been more disappointed in a film EVER! You dont have to watch out for spoilers in this review because if you've seen the original you know whats going to happen in this film. Just nowhere near as good or genre breaking. So please do not waste any time on this. Just go watch the original and best in 4k and forget about this.,2
2057,"So let's get the obvious out of the way, I'm comparing this to the original trilogy. How can we not?The action: It's worse. That's not to say it isn't fun, but I honestly prefer CGI Neo from Reloaded than some of the fight scenes here. That was at least creative. This was more by the numbers. But hey, it's passable action, it's just not as good as the OG action.The characters: They're worse. Despite being over 2 hours, the new faces are not fleshed out. The old ones aren't either really. There's not much of any arc or development for any side characters. In fact, you might even say only Neo gets development and that development is really just a longer and more intricate version of his 'waking up' in the first movie. Even Trinity is just sort of 'there' the whole film and doesn't have much of an arc. But hey, what did you expect? This is a sequel coming out post 2010, they have all been like this for the most part since then.The plot: It's worse. If you liked the cerebral intellectual questions of the OG trilogy, you won't find it here. They do ask questions, they just don't ponder those questions and it's clearly not as well thought out. Often what few answers you get leave you with more questions and unlike the OG trilogy, it's not in a good way that makes you think.You might appreciate this film more if you hated the intellectual writing of the OG trilogy though. It's very on the nose. And it does provide some answers, even though they aren't satisfying or sensible.As for the general story, it's recycled. Yes, just like Disney recycled the Star Wars originals for its sequel trilogy, Wachowski has copied her own story and tried a slightly different spin on it and produced an inferior product. We know how that goes, we've seen it again and again and again as of late. Post 2010 cinema folks, where everything has been downgraded and become formulaic, especially sequels and reboots. There are no original stories anymore for franchises. I'd say I'm disappointed, but again post 2010 cinema, it's exactly what I expected.I do wonder how much studio meddling contributed to this decision though. They did include a snide remark at the beginning about Warner Brothers forcing Neo to make a Matrix sequel or to sell off the property ... Perhaps that's a tip of the hat to the audience about what went on behind scenes here. Wink wink.I hope that's true, because Wachowski did a good job if looking at the film under that lens. Might explain why her sister wanted nothing to do with the film too. It's at least a competent and watchable film, if not original or matching the mysterious tone of the trilogy.There are interesting ideas here, they're just buried under recycled plot, nostalgia and rough and non-existent characterization. For such a long film, I don't feel like much really happened, even with the pace of the film moving as fast as it did. And I mean like lightning!But there is hope. If you thought the ending of Revolutions was a little too sad and dreary, especially for the notable couple, then you're in for a satisfying conclusion here at least. This time, they win and they are in control of The Matrix. That was truly satisfying to see, even if we had to stare at John Wick's hair and beard the whole 2 hours.",6
2058,"I watched the first 20min, and was so impressed, I had to rewind and start it over.Unfortunately, as the movie went on, it became apparent, that they forgot why they did the first movie, and how, in the first place.Gone is the minimalistic humor, the subtle hints. Instead that is now subbed out with almost a parenting approach to the viewerI dont want everything cut out in cardboard for me. You dont have to repeat the important pointers 5 times, for me to understand. If im too stupid to get it in the first place, then allow me to watch it again.I loved the meta-approach in the beginning. Being in the matrix (again) allows for some humor, a different mood, and all that - but they didnt shed it, once the movie startssaw an interview with the actors - and they characterized it as a ""funny"" movie. Then almost took it back - matrix isnt a damn comedy!!!! And i gues they realized halfway through the sentence.It is still watchable - but it has become a parody. Which is sad - but they were so close. But its been dumbed down for the young american audience, who doesnt know anything about anything - and it shows.",5

This whole movie makes no sense. The tone is so wrong that the first third of the movie is leaning so hard on the old movies that it is all just one giant self reference where the characters end up actually watching actual clips of the older movies within the movie itself! Ask yourself if that sounds like a good idea. I know Laurence Fishburne said he was not approached to come back for this, I am wondering if he is letting them off the hook with that excuse because he very likely reviewed the script and saw that it was total grabage and did not want to be a part of it. Don't see this movie if you are thinking about it. All it will do is make you mad.",2

A reboot regurgitated by those who do not see. All hope I had for the only true testament of reality ended in an hip remake, a vortex that swallowed all meaning of reality.

2065,"Soooo they lazily took the original movie with the same action scenes, took out two of the most important characters (Morpheus and Mr. Smith), then added more confusing mind twists,. They added a ton of flashbacks, then made countless efforts at explaining why there's a digital Morpheus running around. Add to that mess, apparently Agent Smith broke the matrix then got himself a younger face.Seriously, if you have 2 hours to kill just re-watch the original.",4
2066,Was so looking forward to the film. What a huge disappointment. Such underwhelming experience. Far to many flash backs. The fighting sequences were predictable and frankly quite boring. I wouldn't pay to watch this film. Had the potential to be a great film. Clearly two heads are better than one.,3
2067,"It is an EXCEEDINGLY RARE occurrence that a continuation, reboot (or even a sequel / prequel) is done properly. The Matrix Resurrections grew a bit. I am trying to say my best to NOT say ""aged"" (on that note, Keanu Reeves seems to have aged far less than everyone else in the movie).For everyone who gives low reviews: What do you imagine as something that could ever satisfy you as a continuation of the original trilogy???So I say that this was a rather decent attempt, given a constraint of a single film. Yes, there are some modern references. There is a bit too much of references to the original trilogy. There are a number of new ideas, and quite plausible ones at that.The only thing that is absolute bullocks about this movie is music. The ending credits are absolutely nothing to bother listening thru, not even for the end-credits joke. So the end-credits music summarizes the overall quality of the movie compared to the original trilogy...I say I have enjoyed this! Thanks!!!P. S. I would watch another one!",7

The acting was meh, the CGI and action scenes were bad, especially compared to the previous movies, and the story and pacing where all over the place.

And then there are all the self referential meta jokes scattered through out the movie. There is literally a scene where they are having a pitch meeting about how to make a Matrix 4... I was highly disappointed and when I go back to rewatch the matrix movies every year, I will be leaving this one out.",1

2074,"Before watching matrix resurrection, I rewatched the original trilogy that was game changing and highly entertainment.Going into this movie I didn't expect it to be better then the original, but at lest it would try to be as good as the sequels. But sadly it wasn't.There some stuff to appreciate from this movie like some of the action scenes were entertaining but not close to the first two. Some of the new characters are kinda likable like Jessica Henwick character, she was entertaining but her hair color choice is really out of the place. Yahya as morphes was a great choice to replace Laurence Fishburne. He was very entertaining and fun to watch however, I still prefer Laurence. Neo character wasn't destroyed and that was surprising! Carrie Moss return as Trinity was a great comeback but it was wasted. She deserved more screen time then what she got.The major drawback to this movie was the script and the direction. This movie had ZERO style or charisma and felt like a nostalgia fest! The wachoeski's had proven themselves that they can make great films. Just like the first trilogy. In the first trilogy the movies had a style and PASSION which is totally missing in resurrection. There is zero effort on putting something new or stylish but rather going on lazy! The flashbacks where so annoying and unnecessary. What's the point of showing this much of flashbacks from the previous films? To remind us how they were good? We already know that. FOCUS ON THE NEW ONE.I wouldn't unrecommended this movie. But don't expect to much and just expect some good action scenes! Overall I'll give it 5.5/10.",6
2075,"Ignoring the fact that this movie builds on previous history, I'd give it 4 or 5. Being a sequel to an epic trilogy, it is sort of hilarious that they joke about making sequels and then complete the joke by being an utter zombie mishmash failure. The plot line and character building follows that of a mediocre series.Recommendation: Skip this one and see the Animatrix instead.",2

It seemed like a bold approach, but it was entertaining.Then the latter 2/3 happened, and it was utterly disappointing. Acting was terrible, story was terrible, writing was terrible, the action was comical. It was utterly disappointing.The story revolved around trinity and neo and their love or something, which is like...who cares. There were no big questions to ponder, no philosophical aspect to root the story. Neo was reduced to a human force field. Much of the story had no stakes, most of what happens doesn't really matter.NPH is not a good villain. No one was a good villain.Anyway, I'm glad I saw this on HBOmax. Not worth the money in a theater.",2

2079,Blathering and cringe inducing. If you like very dumbly written characters trying to deliver hammy lines and weird meta non-jokes this one is for you.,3
2080,"The main thing that had me excited for The Matrix Resurrections was purely the fact that it was a Matrix movie. The original is one of my all time favourite movies that continues to hold up every time I rewatch it. While I think the sequels both have issues (particular Revolutions which I've never really cared for) I've always enjoyed watching them. So despite the fact that I didn't know how good this film could really be I was just excited to revisit this world. I have to say that Resurrections was ultimately a bit of a mixed bag for me but I think it's an ambitious and unique sequel the like of which we've rarely seen.While I didn't think the action sequences in the film were on par with the original, or even Reloaded, I liked them overall even if they suffered from some overuses of quick cutting. I think all the action in the third act was fast paced and thrilling and it all came together for a great conclusion. The visual effects and CGI were improved upon over the other sequels both in the matrix scenes and in the real world. I liked the production design that was continually meant to give the impression that something was off, even if it did suffer from the Wachowski's signature lack of subtlety. On a technical level I have very few issues with this movie.I loved seeing Keanu Reeves back as Neo, in my opinion this is his signature role. He's great in the action scenes as he always is and he has great chemistry with Carrie-Anne Moss. I liked seeing Moss back in her role as Trinity but she had much less screen time than I was expecting. The film hinges upon the connection these two characters have and I think it would've helped if she had been given more of an arc so that their connection would've felt more earned in the context of this story. Beyond that I thought the supporting cast was an overall mixed bag. I thought Jessica Henwick's character was great and worked well as a portal for the audience back into this world. I enjoyed Priyanka Chopra as Sati, one of my favourite parts of Revolutions. It was great to see Jada Pinkett Smith back as Niobe and I liked how they continued her character on from the last film. While I think the set up for Jonathan Groff's character was convoluted I still really liked him overall and I thought he brought a suitable amount of menace that Hugo Weaving always managed to convey. I thought Yayha Abdul-Mateen II gave a fine performance but the character just never really felt like Morpheus to me, the set up was again very convoluted and I just don't think the writing justified the recasting of Laurence Fishburne who I think could've easily stepped into this version of the character with some minor script adjustments. I also didn't care for Neil Patrick Harris' the Analyst, he was too exaggerated and over the top for my liking and I just didn't think the type of performance Harris was giving suited the direction they ultimately took the character in. The less said about the return of the Merovingian the better.I think the film starts of in a fairly interesting place that cleverly shows us things we've seen before in the original trilogy but from a new perspective with new pieces of information to add to the intrigue. I think they managed to justify the existence of this film as a continuation from the original trilogy without it feeling like a meaningless epilogue that only takes away from the original ending. I liked how Wachowski showed the updates to the world since the last film, particularly how technology has evolved since then. However, while I liked all these concepts in theory I didn't always find the execution to be completely satisfying. I think the story was told in a very convoluted way that left me confused about key character motivations and how the set up for this story connects to the first 3 films despite the fact that I've seen the original trilogy more times than I can count. Maybe I'll pick up on more details with subsequent rewatches but I just couldn't help but feel as though this film was needlessly complex and may have benefited from a more streamlined plot.I suppose my biggest issue with Resurrections, beyond it's story set up and how it connects to the original trilogy, is it's self referential and meta moments. There are a lot of call backs to those original films and the script plays a lot of it for humour. After a while the attempts became more derivative of those films than anything else and while it felt as though Wachowski was trying to do something unique with these references I just didn't think it worked overall. It makes a lot of moments that are supposed to feel impactful instead feel cheap and the use of archive footage from the previous films took me out of a lot of scenes.The Matrix Resurrections is a frustrating film that goes too far down the rabbit hole of meta humour, self referential dialogue and convoluted story telling but I don't think I've ever seen a blockbuster sequel quite like this one. This isn't a safe sequel and I have to begrudgingly admire that about this film. It's got solid action scenes throughout with the return of a central character I love but a lot of the new and returning characters left me wanting more. There's a lot to like here but I do think the script could've benefited from more work. I was always interested to see what would happen next and I think I'd like to see more franchise sequels take chances and risks like The Matrix Resurrections does.6.5/10 - B- (Middling)",6
2081,"The film seems to be more focused on ramming liberal political ideology down your throat than actually being a decent movie. Acting was trash, story felt rushed and sluggish at the same time, somehow, and the notion that at the literal end of the world, the emphasis is on woman's rights and not 'stealing agency'. It's moronic. It's boring. It represents none of what made the original so great.",3
2082,"Lost interest after an hour and a half and don't even want to go back to finish it. Name dropping Matrix every couple of minutes, with screenshots and cutscenes from the original movie... wow. Tell me you're milking the Matrix cow without telling me you're milking the Matrix cow.Terrible movie, terrible pacing, awful action scenes, annoying characters, dialogues that put you to sleep. And of course it has to be almost three hours. Seems like every movie these days has to be three hours, without actually having enough quality content for a 90-minute movie.I guess editing is a thing of the past, so last century...Skip it, it's garbage. Gave it a 2/10 only because I like the trilogy. They should have just left it at that...",2
2083,I came in to the movie expecting not a ton of good even though the previews were good which is what they are supposed to do which is et you excited. That was tempered in me as the original Matrix movie was something to behold as a very revolutionary for the time is was made and the quality of the 2nd and 3rd had gone down in quality as generally happens fir a bunch of different reasons. Plus with all the movies that are coming out of Hollywood right now and how many horrible movies they are making left me with little or no hope for this movie to be good. But boy was I surprised this movie is not the best thing I have seen recently but it is certainly better than I could have imagined it would have been.The casting of ancillary characters was very smartly done and the acting from them was great. The visuals were beautiful from end to beginning the action and fight scenes were well done from top to bottom. The script was very well balanced between call backs from prior movies to give us a good nostalgia feel and new information that will propel the story into the future. Overall it could have been better it certain senses like why can Trinity fly now and Neo can't and how does Neo have magical force field powers out of no where. Hopefully these things will be explained going forward in the next installment or installments which there surely will be. Overall this movie is a must watch one that you should watch both in remembrance of and in excitement that this won't be the last time we see Neo and Trinity team up/,9
2084,"Every single expectation I had while waiting for the movie, was blown to pieces. This Matrix sequel turned out to be one of the most poorly made movies I ever saw.",2
2085,"I was a fan of matrix trilogy and am super disappointed with this sequel. It is so bad that I can not even stay to the end of the movie. It has been a long time since I watched such a bad taste movie. I was a fan of Keene Reeves but I am really disappointed in his performance in this movie, he is dull, boring, and super cringy some time.The movie has a meaningless plot that seems to be written to 2 years old kids, it is predictable, super cringy, dull and boring. The acting is equally bad and I feel that no one in this movie care about their acting. Keenu's performance is one of the dullest I have seen so far. The dialog is too pretentious, carry no real meaning and tried to hard to appear fancy. The directing, pacing, cinematography, tone of the meaning is very off, it's as if an amateur director on YouTuber just made a low budget matrix sequel, and it does not like a matrix movie at all! I find this movie to be the result of things going wrong in almost every possible way!",1
2086,"Well I don't know how to expand my negative score for this movie, it's just so bad. Cheese, poor story, terrible cinematographics, homosexual accents here and there.",1
2087,"I want to say ""Thank You"" to Keanu for being the artist you are, to the makers and cast of The Matrix.I laughed, I yelled at the screen, I jumped out of my chair, I cried. I can only say this.'Worth the wait and was the wild ride that made me continue to question, are we living in the Matrix!'",10
2088,"Yet another attempt to collect money from your memories of the original Matrix, counting three failed up to now.You can read interviews where Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss confess they had no idea where the plot was going to during the filming of this one.This third failed movie makes me wonder where the Wachowski brothers got the ""inspiration"" for the first Matrix. They certainly lost their inspiration after that one.",1
2089,"I am honestly not so sure what to write about that movie, and I'm not saying that in a necessarily negative way. Truth be told, I am no huge fan of ""The Matrix"" series of films. I like the first, dislike the second, and enjoy the third - however, I harbor no true love toward them. That said, I was looking forward to ""The Matrix Resurrection."" And now having seen it I can say that, while I recognize this is a middle of the road film that is, in practically every way, less than the original three movies, I can't deny that this managed to entertain me.One thing is evidently clear once the credits roll: director Lana Wachowski did not want to make this movie. The word ""lazy"" comes to mind almost immediately; from the visuals, to the action sequences, you can watch this and realize it is no longer the genre-defining series that it once was. Everything looks too bright, almost as if Lana and crew intended to make a made for television film. The action? While it isn't horrible, it isn't good. Forget wide shots, long takes, and steady cams - for some inexplicable reason the action is filmed in close-up, rapidly edited, shaky camera *heavy sigh*. Granted, it isn't as terrible as the action in films such as ""Taken 3,"" as you can still mostly decipher what's happening and to whom. However, that doesn't stop the action sequences from being a giant and noticeable leap down compared to what they were in the previous movies. My only conclusion, and certain lines of dialogue in this movie point to this deduction, is that Lana purposefully sabotaged aspects of this film as petty revenge for seemingly being ""forced"" to make it.Nothing really stands out in this movie - there is nothing as memorable as when Neo stops bullets in mid air for the first time, or fights an army of Agent Smiths for 10 minutes. All of that complaining aside though, I'll be damned if I didn't actually enjoy this. There is just something inherently interesting and thought provoking about watching a movie where people slowly discover that the world they're living in isn't as real as they once thought, and that's no exception here. Keanu Reeves is as likable as ever, and watching him act alongside Carrie-Anne Moss is most definitely worth the price of admission. The first hour or so of this movie is certainly the most compelling - however, I never once thought that the pacing dragged. I was honestly consistently entertained, even though I don't think the movie as a whole was that good. I enjoyed the more small-scale nature of the story which really empowered Keanu, Moss, and Neil Patrick Harris to chew up the scenery every time they are on screen, which is gratefully, a lot of the time. Sure, in between the acting you'll be graced with mediocre action sequences, but the good news is once those scenes are over, you'll be right back with the characters you've grown to know and love. ""The Matrix Resurrections"" does take a more character-focused approach to its story, which really did manage to keep me engaged.Listen I don't even know what else to say here - is ""The Matrix Resurrections"" worth your time? Judging by other peoples' reviews, probably not. However, if you're as easily entertained as I am, you'll probably find at least something to enjoy here. I'd say give it a shot on HBO Max - that way, if you hate it, you can simply turn it off.",7
2090,"""Everything that has a beginning, has an end Neo.""Watchowski should have think of that line, before making this movie.I'll just pretend I have never seen this thing. It is not worth to carry the name of The Matrix franchise.",2
2091,"What else were you expecting. Loved the call backs to previous films. Action seemed a little repetitive for some of it, but the concept of putting the two main characters against each other in the matrix made sense. Story had a few holes, but if you sit back and enjoy, then you won't walk away disappointed. Not saying I'm gonna award an Oscar, but if you thought anything different going into this, then you don't understand Hollywood.",7
2092,"Film tried so hard to remind of us the past films, just to tell us that this film will never live up to their past successes. Film was dry and was hardly captivating or original. For die hard Matrix fans this might be good nostalgia, but it ends up to be a disappointment.",3
2093,The first 45mins had me feeling really bored but the story as a whole is not as bad as what people are slating it for.So many good moments ruined by cheesy lines or awkward camera angles but as a whole it deserves more credit for doing something different that kinda works.,5
2094,"Truly, deeply, entirely terrible. I mean, not A SINGLE redeeming quality. How badly do you have to screw up to ruin this big a franchise and destroy the good will of this big a mythos? This badly.",5
2095,"20 years for a sequel that held 10 minutes of my attention before I turned it off in disgust. Truly just embarrassing. A one star review seems unfair for the amount of effort this must have taken for everyone involved, though ultimately it should not have been attempted. The studio will probably have enough of a marketing budget behind this to hide the bad reviews as it seems they want to pump out another flavorless trilogy. Or maybe like someone who is sick with diarrhea, they just can't stop.Mutilating yourself and destroying your identity for a delusion, then making hundred-million-dollar art pieces (that are objectively bad) trying to glorify that insanity, is such a heart wrenching cry for help that it reaches me on an emotional level which these agenda driven films could never approach. If you were involved in the creation or production of this mistake: seek help.",2
2096,Loved the original matrix. Never saw the two that came out after. This was so disappointing and really boring. Trinity was great...Neo was weak.. and the other characters didn't even interest me. I tried.,1
2097,"Don't waste your time watching it, absolutely terrible and doesn't live up to the expectations of the first matrix. I thought I was gonna be enjoying a fully action packed movie but it was more like a play, bad acting, John Wick not neo.. Poor Smith agent who refers to Neo as Tom.. Story is awful, feels like a cliché. No real acting. Very disappointed.",1
2098,"I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, a total cash grab, it was too dry, acting was terrible, story was too forced, I honestly couldn't finish the movie, after 40 minutes I couldn't continue and gave up.I'm a big fan of the first 3 movies, those are great, but this, omg.",1
2099,I felt like I was watching the first 4 episodes of a season long TV show. The look and feel is just the quality of a sci fi TV show like Battlestar Galactica but poorly done.,1
2100,"I was looking forward to this after a disappointing 3rd movie in the trilogy. In a word, it was dreadful. Story line seemed to be based on trying to explain the previous three films with constant flashbacks to the first one.....Overall the film was slow, confusing and just awful. Sorry, but true.",1
2101,"Being a fan of the original movie and the two sequels, this movie makes me feel sad, boring and specially angry. A dumb and messy story trying to be special (but it is not), key characters with no charisma, full of bad acting, an amateur editting, cheesy visual effects, and the lists of bad things goes on.It was like if Lana said... ""i will ruin my creation and i will do anything possible to achieve this""Only good thing is that Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving have seen this coming and step out of this projec, but i feel sad for Keanu and Carrie. They shouldn""t be in this pathetic movie.The 2 and half hours movie is an insult to the original 1999 The Matrix movie itself.",4
2102,"Vomit is not enough to describe my disappointment.Zero respect to the original first Matrix movie, bad acting, bad starring, horrible dialogues, illogical scenes and details, cognitive dissonance during the whole movie watching their ""new improvements in their universe"". My forehead got real red from facepalms.Don't recommend this at all, hard pass. It was very hard to wait till the end.",1
2103,It's a shame that they managed to ruin something that was once decent. Some movies need to be left alone in the past. Sometimes the future doesn't work for some movies. What's next? I'm pretty sure there is no way down from here because it's hell already.,2
2104,"Did not even bother to watch until the end.It wasn't just bad... it was ATROCIOUSI didn't think it'd be possible to make a movie that is significantly WORSE than the last Matrix movie. Oh how wrong I was...I can't decide who is worse between ""Bugs"" (Jessica Henwick) or the new Agent Smith (actor unknown, don't care who). Is their acting terrible, because they are just bad? Or is it because the script-writers fell asleep at the typewriter and forgot to include any actually interesting conversations in the script? The dialogue is cliche, lacks any substance and reminds me of listening to teenagers talking about what they did on the weekend...This director has given up, and SHOULD give up. It's as if no effort was made to find any actual talent and the first Performing Arts graduates to apply were chosen... at random... I guess this is what happens when you allow woke ideology to corrupt your artistic instincts.And what's with the bad cinematography? Oh... my... God.. the... bad... cinematography...With the endless switching of close-ups during dialogue scenes I almost needed to take sea-sick tablets just to keep my food down. To the people who were actually behind the cameras, had they actually shot anything before? I'm sure a high-school kid with Parkinsons could have done just as good a job.*sigh*Do yourselves a favor...DO... NOT... BOTHER.",1
2105,"Started watching this film in a big TV in my most comfortable chair and my favorite snacks. Fell asleep after 40 minutes.When I woke up I continued watching it on my phone while I cleaned the kitchen and sent some emails.I felt like I had to keep it on because I owed it to my younger self to give some closure to this epic saga that meant so much for me... It turns out, I didnt need that closure. This should have not been made. But at least I cleaned my kitchen...",4
2106,"""Not Needed"" Sequel. Should have left it there. The only thing good about the movie was CGI, ofc being filmed 20 years later. Story was weak, character development was too.",1
2107,"The first 40 minutes are weird and just seem like they made a movie based on a parody of The Matrix.Then it just seems like a half bad copy of the first Matrix movie, just with newer and more modern technological terms and language usage.The Wachowski brothers must have really needed money after their gender reassignment, which really must have been done by a couple of Thai blind children, to make such a Matrix film as Resurrection ... it must indicate a lack of money to a great extent.So after the first three movies, Neo becomes a pill-eating computer game programmer with no recollection of what he did, but apparently incurred some Star Wars Jedi force magic.Zion falls after Mopheus apparently became power-hungry and IO emerges.The robots fought a kind of Terminator-like war and then went into some Transformers where they became human allies.Smith is more than a playboy, than a Matrix villain.Suddenly, Agent Smith helps them for a short time ... and then kills them again...... and what happens to that massacre towards the end of the film. Almost the entire United States that is suddenly on the street in zombie mode, the heroes shoot right and left and people jump out of the windows, Trinity on a motorcycle with Neo in the back still using his Star Wars force to push people and bombs away with, Trinity suddenly becomes Superwoman in the middle of a jump etc etc.You see a remake of the first in the series, while actually watching clips every now and then, from the original Matrix movies.The only positive thing that came out of watching this movie was that one gets the urge to watch the good old ones in hopes of forgetting this failure of a movie that robbed me of almost 2 1/2 hours of my life.So to summarize; Trinity has lost its memory, Morpheus has become 30 years younger, the robots have become cute and friendly, Neo has become a scumbag and the handlind is the first film again just with more massacres in it.",1
2108,"If you didn't understand this movie it's totally ok.If you think this movie is about Neo being inside or outside of the matrix you really missed the point..This movie is best viewed Inside The Matrix.. And that is just what you did. :DAs a movie plot maybe not the best, but as a mind blower it's awsome.",10
2109,"Lana Wachoswki self plagiarised from her self and sister. It is very bad remake of first matrix with very bad script. It ruined all other matrixes for me.Matrix was revolutionary in many ways and based on various philosophies extending from Cave allegory of Platon to Evel Ginie of Rene Decarts. Matrix 4 is only caricature of the original ""The Matrix"". If they did not have fresh ideas, never should have shot this joke, apparently they are after money.",5
2110,"I did not finish watching this train wreck of a movie. It was that bad. As a viewer, you won't care after a while. You'll ask yourself, ""What am I doing watching this? I could be doing laundry. I could go to the grocery store, and it would be more entertaining than this confused and totally uninteresting movie."" Trust me, that's what you'll end up asking yourself.",1
2111,"Im surprised IMDB has some idiot 17 year old Prashast_Singh posted comment at the TOP REVIEW?

2112,"We're in a world where original stories have the hardest journey to the screen, it takes hundreds and hundred of people doing their best to get the job done so we don't have to watch another remake of a remake... And with a stroke of the keyboard so many will dismissively rate it just 1 star to make a point that they're butt hurt? Seriously? We should be thankful we get to go back to The Matrix at all and enjoy the ride, not be so arrogant to dismiss it with the rating of a reprehensible, unwatchable pile of garbage. It's cruel, unnecessary and not even vaguely true. Get a life - or better yet - let average people (just like you) rate YOUR masterpiece. I don't think you'd like that, now would you?",7
2113,"There has been a complete lack of imagination in movie making in the last decade that now includes a relatively pathetic attempt to revive a trilogy that should have been left alone.You spend the first half hour trying to figure out what the movie is all about. When you reach the scene with Japanese children on a train starting to attack Neo, you realize that this isn't going to work. And of course, it doesn't.Terrible story, horribly boring, and utterly disappointing in all aspects. You should still watch and make your own decision, but temper expectations.",
2114,"This movie is an absolute terrible disaster. Take everything that made the Matrix trilogy so spectacular: the perfectly choregraphed fighting/action scenes, the awesome score/soundtrack that perfectly matches the action on the screen, the cool characters and the cold look and feel of the Matrix. Then remove all these things and you get Matrix Resurrections. It is really so underwhelming... The action scenes - the few of them - are so bad, you actually can see people walking or standing around not knowing what to do. The score/music is so dull you only remember the few snippets they took from the original trilogy.You could think this movie is like one of those parody movies like Scary Movie. But then you see that it tries to copy scenes from the original movies, and you realize they meant this seriously. When I first saw the trailer, I thought this could be a good movie. But then I saw the movie itself and I must say the trailer is better than the movie. There are some interesting looking action scenes in the trailer, but these are all the interesting scenes the movie has. For example, the train scene. You would imagine this results in a very cool long fighting scene in or on top of the train or both. But no, not in Matrix Resurrections. The train scene is over before it really started. And all the interesting stuff is already shown in the trailer. Like all the other scenes from the trailer. Damn, this is bad... really!",1
2115,"I really wanted to like this. I loved the original. And Keanu Reeves is such a cool guy, I wanted this to be a success. And damn- the trailer looked so good it gave me goosebumps.Well, the actual movie is so bad. It reminded me of The Force Awakens attempt to rehash the original Star Wars movies. Only worse. Much much worse.The fight scenes were laughably bad. I mean. It was like an old kung fu movie where people don't even come close to touching each other when they strike. I half expected some dude to show up with a hand fan as a weapon and a bad English overdub where the words don't match his lips. Yeah. That bad.The plot was..: a mess. It tries so hard to rehash elements of the original that it literally has scenes from the original movie flash in the middle of this one. No joke.It's a real shame that what I saw in the trailer was not the movie we were presented with in the end. I really wanted to see the whole simulation reality theme explored. This was such a wasted opportunity. They killed The Matrix.",4
2116,Shame..just why? This could have been so good. Sifi is limitless!! The heck happened here? :(The characters were just so misplaced. Like Agent Smith... cmon!,2
2117,"There are far too many concepts here that don't get fully fleshed out. We have programs hanging out in the real world, made of magnet balls. Agent Smith, who was a program, then became more than a program and is later destroyed, is now a sleeper-cell version of his old program, without the powers of his more advanced programming?! Why? How? And again, why? Original Morpheus passed away, but his old fling is now in charge of Zion 2.0 - and is a cantankerous old woman - I guess you can't have kids when you're flushed from the Matrix? The Architect, who met their demise somehow was replaced by The Analyst; when, why, where, by whom? Trinity somehow buys into her Blue Pill programming, harder than Neo - lame making the woman initially be another damsel in distress that needs rescuing. Not very progressive...am I wrong?There's program exiles now - what's going on there; why were they selected/saved? Portals aren't phones anymore - why? Technology advancement is just lazy writing. What was Sati doing this entire time? Where'd the Oracle go? What are these machines who chose to work along side humans? Why is the ship's Operator wearing an additional eyepiece; what can they see now? Was the cat Deja-Vu, a reset program/trigger? So many ideas presented and absolute dismal follow-through.Smith and Morph's replacements were great, unlike what most people thought. But they certainly weren't given great dialog nor had enough choreography training to really push the favors of audiences. With a little more care, they would have won out our opinions. They did great with what they were given, though. Bugs was a throwaway character. Nothing unique, and had no commanding screen presence. Lexy, Berg and Sequoia, were far more entertaining and commanding.Christina Ricci gets the tiniest cameo but the two goofy game developers get the majority of the montage and the post-credit scene!?! Last - the singer of Brass Against, featured in the cover for Rage Against the Machine, actually urinated on fan during a show!! Why were they used at all?? All in all, this was such a flop! Which is sad because it was oozing with so much potential. Moneywood, is eating itself alive!",4
2118,"As it turns out, Neo is really Tom Anderson (Keanu Reeves) who designed a computer game called the Matrix Trilogy and none of this was real. The people in the game came from folks that he knew. He is told he is supposed to work on a sequel, something new and original. As it turns out Warner Brothers plans on making the sequel with or without Reeves which I felt related to real life. As it turns out, that was not the case. They had to get a new guy to play Morpheus and they had to spend a lot of film explaining why he looked different.Decent action film. Wasn't crazy about some of the plot details turning this into a love story.Guide; f-word. No sex or nudity.",7
2119,"Unoriginal Yawnfeast. Right from the beginning every characters' only reason for dialogue is to explain how they fit to the prequels. Long winded unnatural dialogue wastes the first hour and 45 minutes. Random introduction of characters with no development. Large pot holes to fill for only 2 returning main characters. We watched with friends, 3 out of 4 fell asleep. There was potential in the new world they created but everything was stuck in the past (prequels).",1
2120,"And separte it from the perfection of The Matrix. A a seprate movie its really good and a great message that no one is the ""The ONE"" but the union of man and woman and the love that glues them together like a DNA strand, That love is thew one.",8
2121,"What did I even watch? At first I was angry they used a Red 6k camera because the movie looked overly digital and low budget, but it's fine this movie doesn't even deserve 35mm+ film.I'm also going to assume the pandemic impacting the actors ability to even act..",1
2122,This should have been turned off in the first 30 minutes. The fight scenes were kind of cool but it feels like I have seen them all before. Totally should have marketed this as the matrix a love story.,3
2123,"The first 'Matrix' movie had cast a spell over me. The storyline was well written, and a common thread was recognisable. The fear of the invincible and cold-hearted machines got under your skin, through great storytelling and additionally the great acting skills of former 'Agent Smith' (Hugo Weaving). Keanu Reeves did a satisfactory job on acting 'Neo', as well as Carrie-Anne Moss did on 'Trinity'.Very impressive to me were the monochrome pictures, consisting only of green and greyscale colours and crating a unique atmosphere in combination with a memorable soundtrack.However, none of the sequels could build on old success. The movies went gradually downhill, with 'Matrix Resurrections' reaching the lowest point. The new sequel knocks everything over, what the movies before have built up. From the whole storyline, to more quantitative characteristics of this franchise. Essentially, this movie is just a long exposition for a new sequel to come up in the future, which I'm not thrilled about.The movie has no main character anymore. Although the camera has a focus on 'Neo', he has nothing really to contribute to the plot. Keanu Reeves has never acted so bad, callous and stiff before. Additional to that, his character has almost nothing to say to any conversation in the movie. It feels like Neo is just getting dragged through the plot, by the side characters such as the new 'Morpheus'.This character is even more useless for the plot than 'Neo' seems to be through the movie, even if this one tries to convince you of the opposite by telling you in every possible scene that he is 'the chosen one'.And so has been 'Morpheus' now been added to recreate famous scenes from the first 'Matrix' to produce nostalgia for the fans. But even worse to that is that whole scenes not only have been re-enacted, but parallel to that these scenes have been built-in by flashbacks or TV-screens in the background of several scenes (as you can already see in the movie trailer).In general, a whole lot if the movie is fanservice.And last, the franchise got the Coup de grace by leaving out the monochrome outfits, sceneries and pictures as well as the unique soundtrack and replacing it with colourful characters without corners and edges and a boring soundtrack.In summary I recommend to take the blue pill and be spared of this disaster, like 'Neo' should have done it in this movie.My rating of 'The Matrix Resurrections' lands on two out of ten stars.",2
2124,"""Matrix"" is my favorite movie. It's icon for me. It was the first masterpiece in this theme. This last movie is just embarrassing. Don't waste your time if you are real fan of the first ""Matrix"".",3
2125,"Eh yes, I'm sorry but as a fan of all the sequels so far I have to say that this one is not even half as good as the previous parts. I noticed that they wanted this sequel to be different or more special than the ones so far, to get people even more into believing in some way or enjoying this whole matrix world, but they just made a mistake, did a heavy overkill and overdid it. The special effects are far worse, the fight scenes are also far worse. This is watchable but unfortunately only that!",4
2126,There been a hope that previous parts had more complex and cool ideas behind the story and authors are very smart and will dive us into that. But unfortunately no. This movie is an absolutely disappointing mess. Is that too strong or too weak drugs Lana used this time? Not sure.,1
2127,"Slow and unintelligent. Full of cliches and lack of originality. Action scenes felt like a low budget movie. The characters are primitive and undeveloped with many not even serving any purpose. No wonder, the other Wachowski did not take part in it. As I understood, the whole point of making the movie was outlined in the beginning - Warner Media made them do it.",2
2128,"Even as soon as information about the filming of this film appeared, I realized that it would be nonsense and there was no point even in going to the cinema, for the sake of interest it would be possible to look at torrents. Mockery and an attempt to cash in on the cult film of the past.",3
2129,"There was so many stupid and cringe moments. Matrix will be something like terminator right now i think. It is sad, poor kianu. What morpheus have become.....

2130,"I didn't like M3's ending at all and war heavy story telling. I feel like M4 was just here to correct everything M3 did wrong.This actually reminds me a lot of the original Matrix's ending.

2131,"The Matrix 4 doesn't give something new for the matrix story, The A. I Still has a weak background story, NEO still is the point of the story and any character doesn't have any role in the story, Everything is around NEO, his the key to everything in the story, and that made any other character looks like fill in the blank.The cinematography is from Daniele Massaccesi, John Toll was the best part of the movie, and CGI is not bad but doesn't give me any impact.",5
2132,"New Smith, Morpheous and its crew is just lol. Lonley and sad John Wick lol. Trinity the one? Not only lol but rofl.I mean, the story, effects, cast, everything was so bad. I wish this sh++t was never made.",1
2133,What a dissapointment - i knew i should not expect much of this movie right from the trialers... but oh boy what a fiasco... if you like love the first movie and the 2 sequels(that were nothing special) just make yourself a favour and DO NOT WATCH THIS.Just keep your mind clear and remember the matrix franchise as it was before this movie.,
2134,Useless horrible woke writers have destroyed yet another franchise. More forced woke BS down your throats. Glad I watched this for free. RIP Matrix &amp; Star Wars. Never to return.,2
2135,"Review is for the action setup pieces mostly...Do not bother watching this if you are into Hong Kong or stylized action and were at least invested in the earlier Matrix Trilogy.Even with with the John Wick fight co-ordinator, this was purely an 'American' led edited film. The action shown in the film had potential but has been reduced to the usual movements start (hand to hand action etc) show action, cut away from action, zoom in cut reaction nonsense which is typical of the American way of editing fight action (the same problem with the recent Mortal Kombat film).The Matrix Trilogy was a collaboration with at least having a veteran Hong Kong Director and Fight/Stunt Co-ordinator in Yuen Woo Ping and his family involved.This is a shell of a film, the plot seems to be incoherent, with only some interesting CGI moments and wasted characters brought back the French actor and Jada Pinkett Smith.I'm seeing people praising this film, it does not deserve any accolades.",4
2136,"I finally got round to watching The Matrix Resurrection. I put this off as the reviews here were not so good!I am a huge fan of the original 3 Matrix films and the first film is one of my favourite films. With Matrix Resurrection I felt like I was being pulled back into this world and this was done with a modern twist! The film is powerful and I felt emotionally connected to it especially during the scenes between Neo and Trinity! Yes, I wished the action scenes were a bit more clearer as in the first 3 films but I walked away happy with what I watched! There are strong messages within the film that fit our world! I loved it!",10
2137,"What a wonderful film, I generally do not weigh in on Imdb with reviews, but I am so tired of listening to other reviewers telling me I am not going to like this film, it is terrible, a waste of time, etc., etc., etc. I can't stand it!The Wachowskis are some of the great creative geniuses of our time, I would go to see anything they did.I was not disappointed in this new Matrix movie, I was deeply moved. It has all the elements of the great trilogy of Matrix films, plus more humor, and more romance. In the end, in addition to the stunning special effects, complex storyline, and the beautiful soundtrak, it is above all else a moving love story! Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss give great performances, and the rest of the cast is truly outstanding. Whatever success this film has, I am grateful to have seen it, and grateful that Lana Wachowski came back to direct this new matrix film.",10
2138,"Absolutely dreadful. Its so bad...its shameful. I would have expected more from a fan film. First off, the entire movie is just boring. Uninteresting. Bland...Shallow.Its abhorrent it was allowed to be released...it should have been shelved and possibly released as an unaffiliated ""What If"".... but instead I now have to do the work of removing it from my memory. It is so bad. I couldn't keep focused, it was bad acting, bad story and plot holes, and the effects were some how worse than the original movie which was made for less and had 20 years less technology to support it....Just a disaster. I honestly am refusing to include it in the series. It is just not worthy of it.",1
2139,"What can I say about this film with doing what it does and point out a pointless and unimaginative plot, predictable scenes, slow boring fights, and grasping at something that should have just stayed dead.Sorry for the negativity it's just this film is a complete let down like it's two other predecessors. The original matrix was the best film all others weren't needed.",2
2140,"Just like with the previous movies, some will never get it and remain at the first (or maybe second) level of reading, expecting raw entertainment, spectacular action and prophetic heroes in a virtual world. Even riskier, this Matrix 4 movie takes a more mature turn with its central characters carrying their past and with explicit rejection of binary fights and wars.The pace is perfect, the writing is splendid, the image is top notch and the acting is strong. The story is (too) smart but Lana Wachovski perfectly knows it and brilliantly plays with it under the nose of WB.. and once again of the audience. It is great that she had the opportunity to make this movie. Many clues are for a Matrix 5, especially when the main element of the plot (the real nature of Neo, Trinity and the ""real world"") has not been explored yet. I find it unbelievable that Lana Wachowsky and the ones who understand Matrix are still managing to remain underground. This makes things even tastier and staggering.In this movie, new Morpheus finally takes conscience of its condition and utility. Neo and Trinity don't yet but finally take over the Matrix. Neo seems tired and senseless, which totally makes sense.Matrix 4 is a rare movie these days that bets on its audience and on the long term. The movie is not artificially woke or preachy but deeply progressive and sincere like the preceding trilogy already was. It is a very modern movie moving away from binary conflicts and embracing complexity and doubt. But like I said eerlier, no everybody will get or like this...",9
2141,"I was very disappointed to see how the new movie had been put together. The actors are nowhere near the original films, and I'm glad I had my HBO account and didn't go to a movie theater to watch it...",4
2142,"I can recall the first movies with the post credits saying directed by ""The Wachowski Brothers"" and thinking these directors were far ahead of the game.It was a little suspicious not having both back on board for their crown jewel movie. The sad part was the astounding amount of flashbacks they added to this movie; the best parts of this movie were just replays of the best scenes of past movies. The industry has passed them by and the director is stuck in the past. They tried to pull on the crowd's nostalgia strings by replaying the most memorable past scenes between fan favorites. If I wanted to rewatch the original trilogy, I would've gone ahead and just watched them. It felt like I was watching a show of the Wachowski's greatest hits.The lamest part was they tried to be smart and meta breaking the 4th wall and throwing shade at the industry but still being subpar and a money grab.Shame on the Wachowskis. They need to transition out of the past.",1
2143,"Convoluted plot. Wooden acting. Terrible script. On the plus side, it should appeal to the audience that liked 'Highlander: Endgame' and are still waiting for part 5. Also Keanu got another big pay day. Thank god I didn't pay to see it but it doesn't stop me wanting a refund. Yak, yak, yak. Fail, fail, fail.",1
2144,I can't believe the fact that such a world-changing idea went down to this hollow parody of itself. How? How did we end up like this? What's wrong with the shallowness of the modern cinematography?,1
2145,The trilogy used to make me think . How it ended made me think of why and how made me make up scenarios of why it ended this way .glad to know it didn't mean anything and it was just a movie that has no point because you put politics in storyless movie that used to be great so the hero become a sidekick to the women in the end put him behind her in the shot and it ended with the song of the girl that peed on a guy. Which is perfect to that era.,1
2146,"I have plenty to say but sometimes the best answer to the question, ""why?"" Is, ""Why not?"" And here is some extraneous bs to get to 150 characters 😉...like when I went to University of Phoenix.",10
2147,"Was the Merovingian cursing! So true all of that!. For a moment there, Lana was her old-self again. I believe. Sorry Keanu, love you man. But this was a weak sauce.",4
2148,"It is all about Neo and Trinity.Resurrections is more of a love story than anything else and it fails in that. Scenes from trilogy are much more emotional than from Resurrections. For example in Revolutions when Neo talks with dying Trinity that scene is much more emotional then any scene in Resurrections.But it is not a bad movie, it is entertaining, I was not bored. Some action scenes are pretty good. Best action scenes from Resurrections I like more than any of Reloaded and Revolutions. But some action scenes are much worse then in Revolutions and Reloaded. I did not mention Matrix from 1999 because it is far better in action and everything else then Resurrections.Actually, when I think a little bit more, best action scenes from this movie are not on par with that of trilogy. The only thing that stands out in a good way in Resurrections is it's visual style.",
2149,"Poor action, poor music, poor story, no payoff.Parts of the movie is used to explain the previous trilogy and the logic of the universe, but honestly i didnt get it. Either it didnt make sense or it wasnt properly explained in my opinion.Feels like a parody or a fanmade version of Matrix. It tried to do what the original did but failed in every aspect. At most points in the movie i even felt like it didnt even want me to like or enjoy it.They spell it out during the movie too, no one wanted this.I LOVE crumbs of story and the potential parts of the movie has, but this never delivers.",2
2150,"Disgusting acting. I will only note the well played role of the Architect. For the rest, I just can't take this part of the film seriously. Silly humor. The new Morpheus is more like a jester. And of course feminism. General Jack Sparrow is a woman. The captain of the ship is a woman. And in the end, not even Neo is the main character, but Trinity. All the main ones are all women. Well ... this is a complete disappointment.",1
2151,The Matrix trilogy is just what it is - meant to be 3 films that tie together one story. And I love all 3 of them. Resurrections is a nice throwback to the characters and it does resurrect some good memories. It's a bit like they gave an iconic sci-fy masterpiece a sci-fy romantic comedy ending.As Matrix is one of my favorite films I would probably just aswell watch Neo making pancakes at home and Trinity going shopping (with some bullet-time and sound effects and catchphrases added) and be excited about it.,10
2152,"This was a lot of fun revisiting The Matrix. Come on, Neo is a game designer of The Matrix triology, and they want him to design a sequel? Fantastic! The premise was good, using the ""glitch"" as a way of reintroducing beloved characters was awesome. How Morpheus and Smith helped shape Neo - clever. Don't let the negative reviews turn you off. If you love the original then this is a worthy sequel worth your time. You won't be disappointed!",10
2153,"Another chapter in The Matrix saga.I actually enjoyed it, although it took me a while to get into.I didn't know what was going on at first, but once it became clear, I kind of figured what was next: freeing Trinity.I had re-watched the first three movies before watching this one so everything was fresh in my mind, but those little flashbacks to the previous films were a nice addition.It's not as good as the original, the second or the third one. But it is not so bad either. It has lots of action sequences (that SWARM mode was INSANE!), great effects (the machines were better designed and better looking too) and good music.The bad thing: the villains. They were so weak and were not even close to the great Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, nor were they as menacing as any other agent in the previous films.Don't expect too much WOW. It's the matrix, a sci-fi movie with a love story.",8
2154,"This movie was bad. Bad on so many levels. The writers were trying to sound smart. Instead of creating a story with a soul, they tried to jam in meaning and reason to otherwise an unremarkable story.Acting was bad. I like every single actor in this movie on their own, but they did not deliver. Not even close.Action sequences were BAD. There is nothing more to be said. This was bad.",1
2155,"What a pure waste of time, i remember seeing the matrix 1 in theater and i cant help feeling sorry for what a tragedy the movie wasthe plot is atrociousthe acting is subpar, from about everyonethe combat is about averagemusic is non existanti really wanted to like this but it was really hard going through the whole movie.",1
2156,"I'd rather watch a french art-house movie!!!I kept watching it, hoping for improvement but it's didn't come.Don't waste your time or your money with this !",2
2157,"This continuation in the Matrix saga proves that the Wachowskis fail at understanding what made the Matrix (1999) popular. At the time of its release, many Generation Xers and older Millennials felt disenfranchised by society. Feelings of social isolation and the rejection of society were ever-present themes in music and writing in the '90s and early '00s. The Wachowskis, based on track record, inadvertently incorporated these themes into a cool story with elements of film noir and mystery box.All the other junk (bullet-time, Trinity, prophecies, machine world, etc.) doesn't matter if the themes of disenfranchisement are present and drive the story (Just look at the success of Joker). The Matrix sequels continue to break-down when these themes are absent. For example, Neo in each sequel becomes part of new social groups with hierarchies where he is subordinate. He's no longer the One breaking free from his robotic overlords, but is now taking orders from new overlords. This is boring! All of the sequels suck because Neo leaves the Matrix to enter different Matrixes (social groups).This entry is no different. It overfocuses and overhypes the secondary and tertiary elements and couches them in nostalgia-bait. This movie is glib; it's insulting; a money-grab; and worst of all, it's boring. I recommend either watching it on HBO Max or spending your 2 hours on something worth it.",5
2158,"The movie was so bad that it was difficult to watch it to the end. Storyline was full of holes and the action was not so Well made. I dont know Why they made this movie, i guess it was because of the easy money.",5

2160,"I have never really felt the need to post anything about movies, most reviews fall on one side or the other. However, this movie was so bad (several people walked out of the theater) I would need to warn anyone wanting some entertainment away from this terrible movie. I have yet to see everyone agree that a mediocre movie is actually mediocre. That being said, I do find it curious that this movie would get any rating above 3 stars, and I am feeling generous.Writing - 1 starPlot - 1 starActing - 2 starsHumor - 1 starCheesiness (should have been 5 stars, but at times the movie thought it was serious so...) 1 starAbout the only redeeming quality of this movie was how it made Reloaded (not awful on its own) and Revolutions (awful on its own) seem like they were great and eminently rewatchable moviesI cannot in good conscience recommend this movie for anyone, even if one has HBOMAX don't waste your time.",1
2161,"Power of love defeats the matrix.Women power - Still don't know why Neo is main in the cover, he acomplish...nothing at all.Another wild movie were thy want to normalize abnormal stuff; Classic psicologist but with flashy glasses 'cause...it's normal now...somehow.Full of CGI, sometimes good, sometimes bad and sometimes extremely bad/cheap...why?The whole cast of Sense8 making 1 role, 50% of the movie cast itself.",2
2162,Terrible. This isn't like the other movies. Feels pushed. Wondered why I even bothered to watch the whole thing. I feel like they tried to have a Loki and matrix baby but the baby ended up being put down.,3
2163,"This is bad. Even among the trilogy, it's bad. This was poorly conceived and feels like it ran out of budget. Lazy, that's the word, lazy.Did you know that for Matrix2, that most people hated on so much, they made a section of highway just to film those scenes?The robots are an interesting addition but it reeks of immaturity and 'transformers'.They could've done a story about how it all began, a grand clash between AI and human kind.They could've done a story of an aging Neo, sitting with Trinity, who only exists as a program because she'd already died, and fighting with people who did not want reality, or something.This was just so lacking in macros. I mean the Merovingian himself could drive a whole new story but no. Instead of a stylish torn dusty suit, he's made into a bum who hates tech.Obviously they butchered Morpheus.They could have made a story of how Neo became worshipped as a god and then the AI has another control over humanity. Anything is probably better.Keanu Reeves was better as Sage in spongebob and was definitely better than this.That Bugs girl had to carry the movie on her shoulders the whole way. Her and the soundtrack lmao.And what's with the gore at end? What is that? Some feminist fantasy of revenge? Goodlord..",3
2164,"Oh where will I start? The first half, a big joke. The Matrix, apparently, is a video game (what the hell)? You could literally see Keanu Reeves thinking, ""Why the hell am I in this stupid ass movie? At least I'm getting paid."" But, it wasn't *that* bad. Give it a chance. 5,6,7, and 8 are coming soon, please make them better than this, please.",5
2165,Three films and over two decades later they finally made sequel that has a true semblance to the original. The producers managed to keep some of the creativity of the first while losing the terminator-esque machine chaos of Revolutions and Reloaded.,9
2166,"Characters/Performances:Keanu was a good sport and acted well. The new Mr. Smith is bafflingly awful. The new Morpheus was written terribly, poorly casted and poorly acted. Bugs was alright and Jessica Henwick is gorgeous, but they don't do anything with her. Neil Patrick Harris was alright. Therapist-as-handler was about the only interesting commentary the movie had to offer.The filmmaking:Editing and soundtrack were generic and truly awful. It was the type of apathetic treatment Netflix shows get. It's like they didn't care. The music didn't even sync up with what was happening on screen. Felt very rushed and detached. You can tell scenes were cut. Prianka's character seems entirely cut from the beginning. Also there was no time to breath and just hang out with the new crew of characters. In the original you had quiet downtime with each crew member where they talk a bit with Neo and reveal their philosophy/where they were coming from.Continuing thoughts:While yes, it seems like the film was cut to pieces, it doesn't come off that the writers/director were all there either. This film is the product of a scattered mind. Every interesting idea introduced at the beginning is abandoned as if they're too afraid to elaborate. For example when he first takes the red pill in the theater, Neil Harris is trying to convince him he's having a psychotic break and tries to pull him through the mirror. This is interesting because it implies that subjectivity is going to be warped in this new movie, but of course they don't anything else with it. It would have been awesome if the film was a full-fledged psychedelic trip.Mainly, you get the sense that the Wachowskis must have really pissed off some people in power with the first Matrix. They ended up dressing as clowns and becoming Eunuchs. The equivalent of a dog rolling on its back to make clear that it's not a threat. This film felt like an extension of that self humiliation.Neo is now old, impotent and can't fly anymore. Mr. Smith is now a marshmallow. And Morpheus is now a negative stereotype. The ending, where Neo and Trinity slice open Neil's jaw and say, ""WE'RE THE BOSSES NOW!"" makes you seriously question their capabilities as leaders. It's just irritating. I wouldn't want those people in charge of my Matrix. They're old and mentally ill. And I think that's the point of this film.Anyway, i hope it bombs and they can let the franchise rest in peace. Because the first film is an absolutely undeniable masterpiece! And one positive about this new one is that it makes you appreciate the sheer technical craft of 2 &amp; 3.",2
2167,"Make no mistake, this is a re-union love story first, sci-fi saga second, and there's the allergic reaction to this fourth installment. I lament because there's a 10-rating waiting for this waaaay late sequel had it not been for the sappy Neo-Trinity reunion. If it were secondary/tertiary, fine, but it's like the primary motivation with everyone risking their lives for these two, ugh. Moving on from that, I was surprised how much I took this sequel given the larger negativity against it. It was funny to hear Thomas Anderson's boss (Smith) admit they were forced to make a sequel (to the Matrix trilogy of games) by parent corp Warner Bros because it was going to happen whether it was them or someone else. And you can believe that, since Disney has all the blockbuster franchise titles from Star Wars to Marvel. Warner Bros must be like ""we need to get a Matrix sequel out NOW!"" In fact, I would expect to see Matrix spinoffs - movies and series - due to this franchise-envy. Anyway, consider re-watching Matrix Revolutions ahead of watching this to recall where things left off, although there are alot of flashbacks used to recall key moments. I was again surprised to have really taken to NP Harris' role as The Analyst, he really excelled in that deliciously villainous role. In fact, much of the supporting cast was really good in their roles, so much more so than Keanu who basically slept-walked his way through this. Hopefully, the HBO division of Warner Bros will get the job of future sequels and series because they'll give us something far better than a basic love story.",7
2168,"Brilliant, contemporary and perfectly timed .The sheeple and the simpleton won't understand it or like it .Thinking is not for everyone does the current situation on the planet.",10
2169,"This movie is terrible. The plot is dull and convoluted, and the dark, sinister and mysterious tone of the original is (to a great extent) replaced by light hearted sit-com style comedy. I did not care about any of the characters.",1
2170,"...That this movie will aim for nostalgia, by ripping shots from the first (and the best) Matrix. This whole plot seemed unnecessary for the Matrix universe. It's still a continuation of the previous movie, that I thought couldn't be done worse. Personally I think ending was the worst. Now Neo can't fly, he lost this super-power but thankfully he can still stop bullets, so he's doing that approximately 2 times per minute. Now, that he can't fly they can' really escape from helicopters, BUT they decided to jump. Will they make it? Remember, Neo can't fly, so they can't fly away towards the setting sun. What happens next? It turns out that Trinity CAN fly so they fly away towards the setting sun. What a waste of time.",1
2171,"Attention! I'm from Russia and we got a premier today December 16. I know that world premier is December 22. So I used my chance to see a movie earlier and share an opinion :)The movie shows that no one can win at the end like you can win a battle but not the war. That's not true. That's disgusting metaphor. And that decision erases every win from the original trilogy. That's not cool. I truly believe that a person can win against the world, against 7 billion, yeah. But this movie has a one more «facepalm» - its cast. Yeah! Marvel showed us how to easily change actors and how to describe it seamless to fans but Lana couldn't do it so. Maybe, it's because of Matrix. I mean Matrix is something more, it's not about superheroes or multiverse or magic something else, it's about programs - maths and logic. Windows 8 isn't Windows Vista, macOS is similar to Mac OS or Macintosh but it's different! What we got here: Morpheus is still Morpheus, Smith is still Smith - but they have changed their outlooks entirely. It's not a simple «redesign», it's completely different programs. And they must be named appropriately. If every actor that was changed for some reason just returned for this movie as Keanu or Carrie that'd be better, 100% true. The movie ended like it would get 2 more movies in the nearest future. I really hope that Lana will change things I told here in the future movies, basically I mean returning Laurence as Morpheus, Hugo as Agent Smith and describing that changes to fans adequately. That definately will affect my rating to this first movie in the new trilogy, but at this point it's 5/10, just an attraction that plays on a strings of nostalgia.",5
2172,"Well, it's not THAT awful as I expected it to be.. it's just not good at all for a Matrix sequel, specially in comparison.As a stand alone, it fails to be anything by itself without the previous trilogy. And what it brings is not particularly good. The bar was too high, and that's no surprise to anyone. It would have been shocking, if it surpassed anyone's expectations!! The odds of that are slim to none.. and the creative writing necessary to accomplish it is not easily present on our reality, at least not that easily and frequently.As one of the MANY different possible fan-fiction-like takes on (unnecessarily) extending the lore of this franchise, it brings some concepts that work as an idea. Developing those ideas is another story.. But the fact that it makes fun of itself, and is so self referencing for at least half the movie.. is a bit nauseating. And you can't try to have it all, by (noticeably) replacing beloved parts of it and expect the viewers to not feel insulted.Anyway, this is like the Total Recall remake. You can live the rest of your life without having seen this, as you won't be missing anything! It's not worth seeing in theaters. I'm quite happy Jessica Henwick is getting more roles.",4
2173,"Neo and Trinity were awesome but.without Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus it just wasn't as enjoyable for me. No one can be Morpheus except him, PERIOD.",8
2174,"Did we need another Matrix? No. This movie is a commentary on modern filmmaking. It tackles issues such as consumerism. It sheds a light on companies (Disney) that use nostalgia bait to get people to consume their movies without question. I've been guilty of that. No doubt.As far as all the negative reviews. They are right. Because those are their opinions. Now. This movie has three ratings. It's a 7 if you're just wanting to watch something to pass the time. It's an 8 if you think you're a hardcore fan. It's a 9 if, like me, you've played all the games. Read every book and comic. Seen all the movies including the Animatrix. The action is good. Fights are well choreographed and played out.This movie explains the Matrix better. I know a lot of my friends get confused when I start to go down the matrix rabbit hole. And that's okay. I will not say that you are dumb if you don't like this movie. On the contrary. It's your right to like or hate anything you want. I mean. That's your choice. Is it not.This movie does not expand on the story. Instead. It does it's best to explain it further. I believe the more you view this movie the better it will get. Especially if you take the time to truly look into the Matrix universe. Yes. It could have sequels. But. This movie pokes fun at them. It shows what I've thought for a long time. Movies have gotten dumber. You can count on one hand the directors that truly understand movie making and the point of movies. Don't get me wrong. Nothing wrong with pop corn flicks.I'm glad that Lana got to make the movie she wanted. And not the movie the studio wanted. I applaud her for doing what she felt she needs to do. Wether or not you will enjoy this movie will be up to you. I loved it. And will watch it a couple of more times.I challenge anyone to go back and watch some of the crap Hollywood has been producing in the past years. I have. 90 percent of it is nostalgia batting crap. Only to subvert us. Lol.I've always thought the matrix was a love story. Not sure why anyone thought other wise.It is not a woke movie. If anything. The Matrix movies were ""woke"" before it became fashionable. I hope people understand what I mean by that. By the way. While this movie explains a lot things. It never holds your hand.",9
2175,"I was surprised how they can come up with such a low number of new ideas after all these years. It's like Terminator Genisys more a (Bad) Remake than a sequel. No new ideas, some funny irony but nothing worth watching. Huge disappointment. After Mateix Revolutions I thought it couldn't get worse but it could....",2
2176,After the original trilogy I was excited for this but I was swiftly dealt a vicious hand. Regurgitated theme was okay but with a few twists had my interests peaked from the off however this turned into a feeling of 'what's going on?'.The nostalgic riddled film bunnyhopped its way through with flashbacks that added no real value and seemed to purely push through the feel good factor still holding true from the 21 year old masterpiece that was the first film.Overall I'd say this film really did try something new but through up a miss match of new ideas really underpinning the problem with the film that was that it felt goofy and lost in itself.Final point is the Hugo Wearing and Laurence Fishburne will never be topped and their 'replacement' ruined the film with poor casting especially Smith. I couldn't tell if he was serious or waiting for a comedic punchline. I enjoyed the film at times but this was awful. Do not go.,2
2177,I wish they did not make a sequel to the trio.The story was very irrational and did not give any charm to follow the fourth part.Unfamiliar charactersExtremely boring processUnreasonable and ridiculous.,2
2178,"I can tell a lot of thought went into this, but definitely not what I wanted in another film. Too much poking fun at themselves, just made it corny. My girlfriend fell asleep and then woke up and asked ""Is that Doogie Hauser?"" I was like ""yep...""",1
2179,"I went in with low expectations, didn't realize i could go even lower. It's not fair to Keanu or the original trilogy to make this film so bad. Not even fair to the readily available movie-making tech that took multiple leaps since the masterful original was released!The problems with resurrections start from 'the source', that is the writers. They tried to squeeze out a movie from thin air when they had no enough material to work with. The heavy reliance on the original as the 'literal' backdrop to this flick only confirms this theory. This is how you turn one of the most iconic films of all time into another generic contemporary action movie.The plot has no real conflict, no heart, no purpose or vision. The deep philosophical dialogues are empty, the fight scenes are badly shot. Some of the acting is a bit cringe. The only real value this movie holds is bringing 'some' of the original actors into the same production set. With that said, thank god Lawrence Fishburne was not involved in this project, that way it's easier to separate it from the 'real' matrix, but even if he had been, I'd still give this a 4. I'm sorry Keanu.",4
2180,"Is it a competent SF action film? Yes. Does it raid it's source code well? Yes. Is it more coherent and watchable than 2 or 3? Yes. To be honest I was with it (and giving a 7/10) for the first 2 thirds but then we got annoying info dumping, badly acted (pointless) characters and a whole cringe making rescue sub plot. Still at least I distracted myself from the cod philosophy by counting the plot holes.",6
2181,"It's like a fan-made film. Or one of those hated ""Christmas specials"" that no one actually wants, but the cast are contractually obligated to make. Lots of clever references to the original films, but it never delivers and you're left waiting for the good stuff to start. It made me remember why the first Matrix film was so great, and then made me sad that this film had none of that same magic, despite being almost beat-for-beat in some places.It could have been a springboard to a new trilogy (or at least two films), but instead it introduced some neat ideas and then frustratingly just wasted them. Actually, it stomped all over it's potential and then spat on it's corpse. Those ideas could've been used much better than they were - a machine war, Neo and Trinity back in the Matrix (but why?), old characters, Zion replaced and a new focus on things.Neo and Trinity are back, but the rest of the cast are generic and forgettable.It had some action sequences, but they were dull and lifeless. There's none of the bullet-time stuff here (despite the name dropping). The direction was uninspired and messy. I kept waiting for even a glimpse of what made The Matrix so great - clean, amazingly filmed action sequences that were so, so cool, and of course a story that you could sink your teeth into.Ultimately an unnecessary and odd vanity film that apparently cost $190M. Maybe Warner Bros thought they could squeeze some more cash of out the franchise, but I'd be surprised if it breaks even. At least it didn't retcon/wreck the previous trilogy, so we can just forget that this film exists. Your life will be better if you don't see this one.",5
2182,"I'm a fan of the original trilogy, Yes even resolutions. I was really hoping that despite the flaws this movie with at least been decent.. The first 45 minutes was too meta for me and I did fall asleep twice. Lana definitely did not have any ambition to direct this movie and she definitely should have just left it alone from 18 almost 19 years ago like her sister did. Was this the worst movie? Not in my opinion, but I can see why people don't like it. This is definitely a one time watch and pretty forgettable.",5
2183,"The only thing this movie resurrected was the memories of how bad Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions were. Keanu Reeves fight scenes were filmed in slow motion to hide the fact that he isn't as limber as the younger version of his character which is totally fine given it happens to the best of us. There were so many clips from the first ""The Matrix"" that the movie seemed more like a documentary. Just let the dead stay dead and don't try to resurrect anyone or anything else!",2
2184,"Weak cast. Too slow first half that doesn't add more to the story. Weak cast, weak fights. This movie feels like not the part of the Trilogy even color scheme don't match. Trilogy I have watched many times and will be but with Resurrection once is enough.",5
2185,"I gave one star from the following:-Neo-Trinity-EffectsOther than that, this is horrible movie and you shouldn't waste your time watching this. I had to continue 7 different times to watch this to the end (merely while eating).There's no plot, just a poor bullet time and fighting scenes.",3
2186,"It was worse than I thought it'd be.1999's The Matrix was groundbreaking. The effects and action in 2021's Matrix belong in 1999.I'm not against reviving an old movie or tv show--IF there's a meaningful reason. Unfortunately, there's no reason Nero &amp; Trinity should've been brought back. While the themes of The Matrix are as much (if not more) relevant today as they were 20 years ago, the 4th installment adds nothing interesting or insightful to the series. In fact, it detracts from the previous 3 movies. I still had high opinions of the trilogy, in spite of the last movie, but the 4th has left a bad taste in my mouth.",3
2187,"Maybe my expectations were too high but I didn't expect to see a love story! There is a undeniable bond between Neo and Trinity, but making this bond the main focus in a Matrix- setting just seems very out of place. All the actors were trying very hard to make it work, but the script is beyond redemption.",5
2188,"I like the premise but the execution is terrible, over scripted and poorly put together. It's not even that good visually, we've seen it all before. I kept waiting for it to get going Then I kept waiting for it to end.",2
2189,"For the ppl writing poor reviews, you're nuts and just try to make everything negative. THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME! From 30 minutes in, you're on the edge of your seat for the rest of the movie! Loved the twists and ending! In my opinion, it's the best of the entire franchise! MUST SEE!",10
2190,I watched this movie and thought it was bad compared to the matrix's legacy. I watched the ordinal 3 movies and when I went to watch this one I was disappointed how it wasn't as entertaining as the other films and it left a lot of questions that felt like bad writing compared to the intention questions they left in other films to keep the viewer engaged with the story after the film was done. In conclusion this movie was a disappointment to the legacy of the matrix.,5
2191,"Terrible movie in every single possible way. Nothing more to add, but hey this needs at least 150 characters.This movie should not ever happened, if you are lucky enought to skip it, do it.",1
2192,Movie provides a new meta-narrative that unravels a new type of story telling - something new. You have to watch M4 multiple times to understand the story. I agree it was not heavily martial-arts-oriented but had more emotional-vibrational fights. Great movie!,10
2193,"I remember seeing the Matrix for the first time. What a mind blowing experience, what an awakening experience! The sequels were good, not perfect and I was happy revisiting the Matrix univers. But this, this is awful in every way and I could go on for days but one thing in particular that I was thinking was that in the opening scene of the Matrix, Trinity was scared to death seeing the agents. In comparison Bugs makes jokes at first contact with them. No tension, no stakes, no atmosphere, no compelling story, no memorable quotes, no memorable characters, poorly choreographed fighting scenes, poor CGI. Rest in peace Matrix.",1
2194,"I have never give a 1 star review in my life but it was going to happen at some time, I just never thought it would be The Matrix.Where to begin? Maybe the fact that I am a therapist and thought their main premise ""the power of love"" was mushy and had no real purpose.The movie had no real plot line. There was no purpose to the movie, no real reason for anything that happened.The part that hurt me the most was the fact that we are living in the tail end of capitalism with global warming looming in the background and a primed generation ready to leave the matrix and we completely ignored it.A total waste of my time.",1
2195,"From a young age, I watched parts of the matrix, literally pulled this world of utopia and dystopia, where even Zion is a matrix, the hopelessness of what is happening, a gloomy but insanely stylish picture, starting from the staging of combat scenes, ending with perfectly matched images and costumes, for example, a small but very important detail, Morpheus always keeps his hands behind his back, indicative dominance and thirst for power, and, it would seem, such a trifle..Unfortunately, there is practically nothing left in the new matrix that we love new films for, melancholic tones and gray, literally black suits, have been replaced with colorful outfits, and the change of lighting is explained by the ""reconfiguration of the matrix"". There is no longer the charm that attracted us all these years, a solid disappointment and sadness from the destruction of such a great franchise..P. S. the film says, literally quoted, that regardless of the desire of (now sisters) Wachevsky, the matrix would still be reshot, so this is a pathetic stub, the hopelessness of the situation. It is a pity that in the prehistory of the film, or rather its creation, there is more from the matrix than in the matrix itself.",4
2196,"Why on earth did Keanu and Carrie-Anne sign up to this film, are they that desperate for cash? Thank god almost everyone else saw sense. This is so low budget, bad acting and badly written. Anyone giving this above a 3 has never seen the original Matrix film or has bad taste. Why mess with something that was great, it should have been left alone. Your not missing out on this film by not watching it.",1
2197,"All is in the title ...First filming is bad, action scenes almost look like out of a Steven Seagal movie.Second scenario is bad, first hour is really boring then it starts to play like a normal matrix movie but as I said filming does not hold up.I was not expecting anything from this, ""let's just make more money out of this"" kind of sequels ....Non they reuse all Superman and Supergirl scenarios to make plenty more Matrix sequels.",4
2198,"Very disappointing, they should respect Matrix legacy, I am giving rating five just for the visual effects, apart from that, the story and scenario were weak.",5
2199,Seriously?? I don't think I ever watched movie this bad to the end...It is like they mixed all three movies together. But it turned out bad.Nothing more to add. NOTHING!,1
2200,In 1999 the world wasn't ready to hear Wachowski sisters story. They sugar coated the story and everyone's taste buds went into overdrive.It's 2021 and Lana believes it's time to get everyone's head out of the sand and face the reality!The Matrix Resurrections is exactly what I didn't expect it to be. It's genius and so smart that only few will fully comprehend Lana's vision and intentions.How we consume things changed. These days the audience expects to be carried into the films core on cotton clouds with a glass of champagne in one hand and charcuterie plate in the other. And that's why many masterpieces in recent years get get so little acknowledgement but flicks packed with senseless action and stories of little substance become the go to movies.The story telling technique Lana uses is almost extinct in the film industry these days. Lana laser cut this technique and polished it over the years to a very high standard.The Matrix Resurrections is THE ONE movie you'll need to watch with your eyes glued to the screen (every second of it) and with your brain plugged fully into your consciousness.,10
2201,"This movie is like a masterclass on how not to make a sequel. The script, awefull, direction, terrible, editing, brainless, casting, what were they thinking, even the sound track is horrible.You can see very similar fingerprints of Sence8 all over this film, only that series had some redeeming features. This movie has very few.",5
2202,"I was intrigued by how there were going to pull it off and connect the dots of a plot that ultimately resulted in boredom to the point of falling sleep long before it was over. But I woke up and kept watching, moved by nostalgia and false hopesThe nonsense in the story is even worse than the Architect speeches in the second chapter, Matrix ReloadedThe action sequences are predictable (freezing bullets, helicopters firing over rooftops... again?!), making the end unsufferable.",2
2203,"Why bother if the movie is rushed, poorly produced, directed and the saddest sequel since...I can't think of a worse sequel. It's just not The Matrix. It's a sad, rushed, poorly written/acted version of The Matrix. The real Trinity doesn't even show up until the end of the movie. Neo looks like John Wick for most of the movie except Wick is more interesting. There's no real purpose and the plot is ridiculous. Almost anyone in the world could've written a better storyline. A big waste of time. A horrible movie. Matrix fans deserved a lot better than this.",2
2204,I guess that's the problem. My friends and i watched it and were left confused and wondering what the point of the whole movie was in the end. 70% of it was just neo and trinity trying to remember themselves and the past. The other 30% was random violence. I didn't see them save anyone or anything. So was it a love story?,3
2205,"This is the sequel no one asked for. It's an hour too long, looks laughable but not in a good way. The first hour actors explain to themselves what they already know as if they are demented. What could have been an interesting script idea materialised in a boring, shallow and disappointing movie.",3
2206,"Looking at some of the reviews I wonder if we watched the same movie. I understand that people want to see big fireworks, martial arts moves out of this world using wires for areal pirouettes and somersaults, etc but to me this movie was on a different level as it was posing philosophical questions of existence and reality. I am going to leave it at that.I really enjoyed it.",8
2207,"There is a lot to like in this sequel. It follows the beats of the first Matrix but makes it a little more meta. The characters are not too developed so I think this is mostly for the fans of the original.The one big let down was the action... I was surprised how bad the fighting scenes were. There is just too much stuff on the screen, Reeves is more of a magician than a warrior here.Agents are also greatly deflated here, they kill nobody in the film, and almost everyone seems to have a reasonable chance against them.The good parts are the Niobe character arc, and way they develop the story around the new city, the rescue mission, etc. Basically, everything in the Matrix is underwhelming and everything outside of it(the real world), is well done.",6
2208,"Imagine a Matrix movie where the role of Morpheus is unclear, even confusing. Imagine a Matrix movie where fight scenes are so cut that you cannot see any emotion that goes into the scene. Imagine a Matrix movie with about 2 h of exposition dialogue and entire pieces of the script lifted from the trilogy. Imagine a Matrix Movie where the Merovingian has no impact. Well, now you can see all that. It's called Matrix IV...On the up side: the acting is good and there are a few good (philosophical) ideas in the script - like, maybe 3 such ideas. The rest... it's the down side. The heartbreaking down side.",4
2209,"The original Matrix film is a classic. One of the most culturally impactful movies in my lifetime, it's terms are still used daily and it was way ahead of its time. The action and atmosphere was also great too. Resurrections could never recapture the cultural impact or foresight, but my hope was action and some consideration of deeper themes. They were there, but...The changes in the world since the last movie were confusing. The movie also struggled with the nods back to its predecessors, and honestly the fourth wall breaking and wink wink was overdone. The new actors for agent Smith and Morpheus... weren't bad...but if you can't get Weaving or Fishburne back it would've been better to leave them out and go with new characters rather than new actors, they are both too iconic. The rest of the supporting characters were given airtime but were forgettable, I couldn't remember any names or purpose for any of them.The new villain had their moments, but was never scary in the way Smith was...more of this modern day weird and witty villain type which are better for short attention spans but not menacing. They also spoke a bit of truth about life but given they were the villain perhaps this was a subtle way of saying those viewpoints are wrong... anyway.Action in the movie was great, maybe not as good as the first three but still above average. By now you would have a view on Keanu Reeves acting which won't change in this movie but I enjoyed seeing him back. The ending you could kind of see coming with the current cultural cringe, they might be setting up for a sequel... but I hope they don't. It seems Matrix sequels are diminishing returns.",6
2210,"To be honest, I am a fan of this trilogy. This movie was not disappointing for me, although its not good as the first parts. But man, what more you can ask, it provides you a very amazing cinematic and visual experience with a very average story that might be its bad point.Apart from all that I don't think it deserves that much criticism.",8
2211,"This sequel feels so amateurish and silly that I can't help but suspect that the Wachowskis got so sick of being nagged into making a new cash cow trilogy that they decided that Lana would make the movie that ended the franchise for good. This is it. I feel sorry for the main actors having to act like that, speak those lines and be a part of this debacle.I didn't really expect much from Matrix 4 since the original trilogy had told the entire story. All the ""meta"" stuff in M4 was so cringeworthy that I've got to spend quite some time to remember something that was as cringeworthy as this movie.This is simply a very bad movie, badly written/scripted and badly thought out. There's not much else to say really. Matrix is dead... offline.",3
2212,"Ok... Nostalgia pays off, but the story for TMResurrections was just not there. The movie was not good. By no means am I a huge fan of the Matrix franchise. I mean I watched the first 3 movies during the 2020 lockdowns, but this movie felt weird. Also... I felt as if Keanu Reeves was tired of being there. His acting was so lackluster. No hate to the man. His John Wick movies are great, but I really did not enjoy seeing him as Neo this time around. I do have to give praise to Jonathan Groff. The man gave an excellent performance. The highlight for me was seeing my girl Trinity again. Carrie-Anne Moss will forever be one of my favorite actresses and her portrayal of Trinity is one of my favorites. All in all the movie is an okay watch, but it really never had me. It was lost in the spectacle of the now a days movie remakes.",4
2213,"What a boring story! How boring effects. How boring acting. The creators of the movie seems to be stuck in time...the story seems to be a boring repeat of previous story. Please don't make anymore Matrix movie. After this, i don't wnt to re-watch original movies.",2
2214,"No one can be told how bad the Matrix 4 is. You have to see it for yourself.Virtually everything is bad about this movie. The story is bad. The casting is bad. The actors are bad. The fight scenes are bad. The allegories are bad. Scenes just stop in the middle... because of reasons. Everything is explained in detail, because every detail needs a convoluted, because it just makes no logical sense and does not follow from what happened in the first three movies.The only good thing is the visuals and the cinematography, and there's an obvious chemistry between Reeves and Moss - but those can't really save the movie either, which is not worth watching, not even as a time filler. Think of it as the Star Wars sequel trilogy, just a lot worse in virtually every regard.This movie should never have been made under the name Matrix, and will always be treated as separate from the Matrix Trilogy, because other than copying some characters (merely by their names, not even by their behaviors) and some of the original actors also appearing in this movie, this one really shares none of the qualities of the originals.",4
2215,This was so bad ... it basicly destroyed all of the matrix movies for me ... 100% waste of time ... just overlook it .. if ur a matrix fan of the trilogy .... if ur a fan of crap then u might like this ... as this is crap on the side of more crapy crap ... enjoy!,1
2216,This movie was trash! Definitely Wasn't as good as the 1st or 2nd film. The storyline was just trash! And even the acting was mediocre. I expected better from Keanu Reeves. Hollywood seems to be going down dill with this. Watch this movie if you're bored. I don't recommend it to your friends or family. Quite boring.,4
2217,Despite the myriad of repetitive special effects it's a stinker. The pseudo metaphysical 'plot' is not deep but a failed attempt to be interesting-which it is not. Too much introspection and contemplation. This should definitely be the death of the franchise. RIP.,3
2218,"The charm and story of the trilogy is lost, part 4 is just good enough for a straight to video release. It just felt cheap, story was very mediocre, special effects weren't interesting or needed.I applaud the attempt at something new, but I don't understand how no one working on the film couldn't tell it was THIS bad.Cardboard acting, lame story...I won't go on, just know it took me 3 sitting to finish over 2 days. Yeah, it's that bad.",3
2219,"I was such a fan of the original and this rehash left me confused, bored and disappointed. The action was mostly an boring re-hash of the original but without the excitement of the original. None of the action lived up to the originals. Much of the story didn't make sense, such as why Neo no longer had the Powers of One - ie not able to control the Matrix as he discovered he could do in the original, and this time suddenly, without clear explanation Trinity could.Very disappointed.",3
2220,"My expectations is high when I have heard the new part of matrix going to release. So, that feel full of excitement. But when Im went to cinema, I found nothing new, nothing any twist, nothing good action and not even new effects also. Except Neo and trinity, all others are new faces but thing is that no any improvised script. It dissapoint for me.But yeah! For a new audiences it would be new action, sc-fiction flick.As an Indian audience, good to see miss priyanka Chopra. That's all.",6
2221,"I hoped this would live up to expectations, but unfortunately it didn't for me. I found the story a mess, the dialogue cheesy and predictable, and Keanu's acting was cringeworthy at points, and that's coming from a fan...I only stayed to the end as I wanted it to improve, I wanted to love it! But this neither stands alone, nor flows from the trilogy. Some things are better left in the dizzying heights of nostalgia. Two stars, and a recommendation to leave this one as a blip in the matrix from me...",2
2222,"Really bad. Shallow seems like low budget film. Jesus christ it was bad. Every single scene a crime. Real bad acting too! And Keanu Reaves apparently does age! ""No I'm done fighting"" best quote from the movie, cause quite evidently they should have let it been!",1
2223,"I LOVE the original trilogy, I love the effects, the acting, the story and the many meanings one could derive from the plot. It was groundbreaking in so many ways.This, however, is not. The plot is an incoherent mess, so hard to follow that it's incredibly frustrating for the viewer - probably doubly so for your average IQ American audience viewer (no offence).I lost interest about 20 minutes in. Couldn't care less about the English Captain (can't even remember her name), who mumbled her way through the plot. The Morpheus reimagining was a mistake, taking a beloved character responsible for so many pop culture references and turning him into a unintentionally ridiculous melt. NPH was out of place but did his best and Keanu 'woah'ed his way through the 2.5 hours probably wondering WTF was going on just like the audience.Carrie Ann Moss was probably the closest portrayal to an original character and she barely got any screen time.I know Lana Wachowski is on record as saying she needed to make this film after her mother died, but honestly it feels like a cash grab with masses of studio direction (e.g. Insertion of flashbacks and constant rehashing of language used in the first film).Really disappointed, a missed opportunity on every level. The only positives were the special effects.Sorry Lana.",2
2224,"I rarely if ever give film reviews but I just saw the new Matrix Resurrection and I must speak out in hopes of sparing the public. Please do NOT waste precious adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aka energy, time, or money watching this film....it's THAT bad. I LITERALLY cannot recall ANY movie in my living memory that is as horrible as this film. It was worse than ""Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets"" and I gave that movie a rating of one star.When I say this movie is absolutely awful I mean that you will find more enjoyment, substance, and context watching a trash compactor or washing machine than you will watching this film. It was so bad I literally watched 2hrs of it in fast forward, all while shaking my head in absolute horror and yelling ""are you kidding me?!!!"" repeatedly. I truly believe a person on hallucinogens could've written a better script/plot. Not even the acting talents of Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne-Moss could salvage this cinematic monstrosity.When I say I watched it in fast forward I mean I literally fast forward thru TWO HOURS of this film and it's only 2 hrs and 28 minutes long. It was that egregious. Please spend your time, money, and energy on something else like cooking for your family, supporting cancer research, walking your dog, or even breathing. You'll be better off. You've been warned! 😒😒Rating: -F.",1
2225,"All these years I had a feeling the story wasn't over, that universe could yield way more stories, so I was very excited when it was announced. After watching it I have mixed feelings.The movie is very long and they take their sweet time ( 45 mins ) to introduce us again with the franchise. The good news is that they manage to bring us up to speed in a way that isn't too far fetched or isn't retconned into oblivion. Downside is that the first hour is very slow so don't expect action from start to finish.From there on out the pace picks up but the monologues of the bad guys reminded me of the one from the Architect in Matrix 2. If you are a fan it's doable but new fans will probably zone out or it will be over their heads ( watch the trilogy before you watch this one ! )The last 30 min of the movie has lots of moving parts and interaction and I probably will have to watch it a couple more times before it all sinks in. If it is done right like in Inception I don't mind at all but my first impression was not positive. Seriously, it's a mess that's all over the place.If this was intended as a stand alone film it's a big fail, however this has all the signs of a second trilogy and then I can understand why they introduce so many new concepts and bring back so many old characters this late.That being said, the movie suffers from the.lack of Weaving and Fishburne. The nods to the original movie is fan service at it's worst, trust the audience to recognize the lines or the scenes without showing old clips to spell it out ! Matrix fans can connect the dots without being spoon fed.Overall I have the same feeling I had when I first saw Star Wars episode 7. Something familiar, something new, but they've made this movie a couple decades ago already (better) . Nothing revolutionary, nothing iconic except for some really cleaver lines that make fun of their own franchise.If you are a die hard fan you'll probably rate this better than 3 but if you are new to the franchise I don't think this movie will turn your world upside down like the first one did for us.Let's hope we'll get 2 more but fingers crossed it's done by both sisters. So much potential but 4 didn't hit the spot.",7
2226,"Just awful. Most probably the worst film I have ever watched (and I watched ""Fifty Shades of Grey""). Cannot believe how somebody in post-production said ""This is a great film! Let's release it to the public!"" - they should have not done that. Would recommend it if you hate your date and you want them to spend a miserable evening.",1
2227,"Matrix Resurrections came out a week early in Asia and I had a chance to check it out earlier today. It's not a bad movie, but it isn't nearly as good as the original film.I personally found it somewhere between part 2 and 3 in quality. Part 3 was awful though in my opinion so that was a low bar.The setting and background was amusing. I liked that. The action is good in all the movies though I didn't quite find it on par with the action scenes in Matrix 2.Story wise though it has some holes. It seemed like they were trying to blow your mind and playing with the fun of the setting a bit but it reminded me a lot of the second film in that regard.All in all though it's not a bad flick. Just temper your expectations and you will likely enjoy it.",8
2228,"I was eagerly anticipating this with all that has gone on over the last few years this was hopefully going to be a shining saviour for the cinema industry. I left the cinema before the end which has only happened a few times in my life. It felt disjointed, the actions scenes seemed cheap and almost like I was watching a disney land performance of pirates of the carribean.Dragged on for too long and tried to be more intelligent than the film actually was.In closing if your a fan of the original Trilogy steer clear of this or go in with the mindset that you will be disappointed and maybe you will come away with something from this that I'm afraid I didn't.",2
2229,"Really pooor production team behind this. Script was really awful in places, mis-cast scripts who were quite poor in their delivery. Music was generic crap. Plot and story telling were massively complex for no good reason. The editor was getting paid by the cut and by the runtime. Just terrible.",3
2230,"As a huge fan of the original trilogy, I was weary about this since the trailer came across as low budget, less stylised and a cash grab.It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The first 45 minutes is basically a cringe game development scenario with flashbacks to the previous movies (like we don't even remember them?). It's like a long introduction to a new netflix series but they want you to know what happened previously.Once the action gets going its clear its a low budget release compared to its predecessors, with characters you couldn't care less about, a story that I wasn't interested in, and a script so awful that I can't believe it got approved. Absolute cheesefest of a script.The stunts are low budget too, enjoy the ""floating"" but clearly hanging on a rope section.The actors who decided to not return to this franchise for, ahem, ""scheduling conflicts"", dodged a bigger bullet than Neo could ever hope for.",2
2231,"Almost mediocre for me is a 5.7 and this ain't it.This movie is entirely too meta. The foundation for a reason to follow up is hollow and unsatisfying.The changes to the lore add nothing and only detract from the initial prestige of the franchise.It feels overly expensive and simultaneously cheap.It feels the way I did after realized The Force Awakens was just a rehash of the originals but with an accurate atmosphere of the universe.The difference here is that you'll realize it before the film is over half way complete.The tone is right but the devices to achieve a plot are empty, rhetorical, aesthetically pleasing nonsense with no soul.I had hopes of a decent film after the first 20 minutes or so but then it starts a free fall.I hope you like it as a popcorn flick but it's entirely too long to be such a disappointing cash grab.The juice ain't worth the squeeze is all I'm sayin folks.",5
2232,"Low expections but thoroughly enjoyed the experiences.I loved the set up, it all worked within the Matrix story. I loved the commentary, whether on social media, society or big business, it gave me a few laugh out loud moments. Especially when I could anticipate the anti-woke reviews and outrage it would cause.Anything that annoys the anti-woke crowd always gets a couple of extra stars from me.Great routine but just did not nail the final landing.I can't immediately think of what would have made a better ending but it did seem a bit....oh, let's just stop there.But overall, it is a good fun film.",8
2233,"Opinions of magas notwithstanding this is an excellent addition to the series. Sure old ground was touched upon, but lots of new material, great effects, and wonderfull to see both Keanu and Carrie Ann reprise their roles.

2235,"When I think about matrix I picture an iconography, a style, a visual. Something like star wars has, or marvel. The visuals that the matrix franchise has were not reflected in this movie. At least not at all capacity. I am giving it a 6 because, although it was an entertained movie, it failed to convey or be faithful to what the matrix concept is.Time goes by and this movie is good as any other as Fast and furious. Entertainment without deep.So much potential wasted.By the way. The supporting cast could have been chosen better. With all the money involved in this project don't know why don't spent something more in actors to push the movie farther.",6
2236,The 1st Matrix was mindblowing; this version was mind-boringThe 1st Matrix was groundbreaking; this version was a repeat of the best parts of the 1st matrixDon't waste your time on this - you will come out thinking that the Matrix was horrible.Just watch the first one in 1999 and stop there.,2

2239,"TMR is a Sara Lee danish of a movie. A solid base of re-hashed action, a soft fruity centre of second act boredom and light flaky pastry of meta fan service. At times I felt like I was watching some kind of Saturday Night Live sketch making fun of a Matrix sequel. Congratulations The Matrix you have joined the ranks of great 20th century movies ruined by modern Hollywood. No one can tell you how lame this is, you have to see it for yourself.",5
2240,"This was a great follow up movie, that filled in all the blanks, and then allowed our heroes to live again! What more could you ask for? People act like they rewrote Shakespeare, instead of what these movies are all about. It had the spirit of the first movie, which we should all agree was delightful. If you like a good happy ending, this is the movie for you right now.",10
2241,"Emotionless, boring, poorly choreographed fight scenes, pointless, uninspired, flat, dull...the extreme opposite of what the movie was supposed to be.This took a cult classic full of awe and excitement and failed to even reproduce a small amount of that feeling and emotion the storyline was trying to create...",2
2242,"Probably not. However WB has rebooted something that they can spin off or forwards w a new set of actors. Or games. Was this good?...maybe. Parts were ok. Parts seem confusing. By the mid way mark the story seems to go sideways. If you liked the first one and tolerated the second helpings, then you'll be ok w this one.",5
2243,"This movie was just terrible.I never moved seats in a cinema, but for respect of anyone (however unlikely) who may have enjoyed this Content Movie, my boyfriend and I - after ""going out for a cigarette"" - told our other friend we will ""go"". Which could be interpreted that we leave, which in hindsight maybe would have been wiser.The first Matrix was colour graded green,Resurrections however was almost the Ukrainian Flag as my boyfriend and I couldn't stop laughing about during the entire film. And it was borderline insulting how ""otherness"" was treated in this movie. Sorry ¯\_(~^~)_/¯.The entire Berlin cinema burst into laughter when Berghain's logo was ""tattooed"" multiple times on the arm of some character whose name I cannot remember.And at least our faces, along with Carrie-Anne Moss' (the only redeemable cast member from the original), were moving! Hopefully not to the total lack of nuance or subtext, and totally completely absolutely self aware intro which only made more aware the fact that this movie could have been so many other things, and oh - so much better. If only for the fact that the visual effects feel like iMovie vs ANY PROFESSIONAL OFF-LINE EDITING SUITE.I think it is lucky our cinema sold wine, that Hugo Weaving had alleged ""scheduling conflicts"", and that the movie did in fact end.",1
2244,"I'm a massive Matrix fan and somewhat Wachowski fan although Cloud Atlas was the last entry I liked.This is the worst film I've seen in a decade. And for it to be a matrix film is painful.I give it a generous 3/10. The 3 is because some of the scenes aesthetically look nice and one or two of the actors turn in ok performances despite everyone being hog tied by a garbage script. The CGI is poor, the action is boring, there's no stakes built by a truly abysmal script. No one seems to have any motivations of their own apart from Neo but you wouldn't know it from Reeves' lacklustre performance.I knew from the trailer that I was in for a poor experience but from being a long time fan of the first film I decided to pay WB money and go and see it anyway. Wish I hadn't. I truly regret going to see it. Depressing to see the death of something I loved, The Matrix Franchise.",3
2245,"Feels kind of like a mess. It's not written well with the plot kind of loosely hanging there and messy. It's very blah. Nice to see some familiar and new faces and the acting isn't bad It's just the movie itself that is quite bad, boring, you don't feel engaged or committed at all. No one is ever watching this twice.",5
2246,"The movie was like a bent spoon that never felt right. Watching discount Morpheus and Smith, lowered the bar of expectations, which shows that waiting for the right actors, makes a big difference. I really wanted to like this movie. But not like this...not like this!",2
2247,"Why does the cinematography of the new Matrix film so awful?! Was it the lenses? Cameras? It's SO close-up, and overall really horrible and cheap-looking! The CG is completely devoid of style and weight, and it's almost like they shot the entire thing for like $20K. What the heck happened!?",1
2248,"I'm writing this while I'm watching it for the 4th time in 4 daysEach time I watched it , I had a different opinion ( Remember when you watched the first Matrix? )maybe it was the same!First I was too excited, too afraid of disappointment, Too anxious to have a new experience of life time for the second time after the first original part!Then when I saw how its going, For the first hour. I felt a mixture between shock, disappointment, Admiration for the boldness of the approach. Excitement about the massive impact of that new bold approach for such an iconic movie.Then I started to think like the director. What the ( ) Did she meant to do ??I got to a point. That it wasn't just a sequel to the original !! It was an exquisite way to make a statement of creativity !?Now I felt like an associate on the experience ,She meant to make me an accomplice at the new crime against the ordinary status quo.Now I feel that while the first part was an eye opener, This part is a heart opener by all means.",10
2249,"This Matrix made me angry. In 1999 when i firstly saw the first one i was so amazed and that amazement was only getting bigger and bigger through the years.For many people the second and the third were not on par with the first one but i loved that we had the chance to see Neo in full power and explore the entirety of the Matrix Universe whether it is online or the Apocalyptic Real World.In one phrase this installment was a mess.It certainly has some points that are very interesting but the execution was awful. I really liked the fact that they wanted to break many beliefs that were constants during the trilogy.I am still super bitter that the action was that bad and i will be for years. The Matrix has had the best action scenes ever and especially the last battle against the Super Smith was the closest we could get if a dbz live action movie was ever released. That fight occurred in 2003 and in 2021 we had some of the most boring fights i have ever watched.I checked the budgets for all movies because i thought that this installment did not have the appropriate budget to pull something spectacular off, but no, the budget was ok, it seems that probably the money were not allocated accordingly.I am very sad because this movie was the most anticipated form of entertainment that i had in years, i love the matrix universe and the characters and they did them dirty, i now completely understand the Star Wars or GoT fans and their bitterness towards their shortcomings.Tbh i don't want The Matrix Universe to end with Resurrections but i really would prefer it if they treat it so dirty in the future again. I would prefer it the entire story continues through some game, or some comic, or some book because i understand that movies is tough to pull off and people (like myself) having expectations through the roof that someone cannot easily pull off.As an end not to anyone that have endured my mumbling thus far, If i did not love the universe, the actors and the characters that much i might have given a lower rating that 5/10.",5
2250,"Disappointing. After almost an hour of twisted dialogue, which gives the viewer the impression that he is worse than the screenwriter and the director, that he has not caught on to what it is about, follows pure cartoon scenes, very used by many other films in the last twenty years, since the first Matrix appeared. The final lines are childish and false, completely unsuitable for the actors. It's a two-and-a-half-hour movie that could easily be released in at least an hour. I guess it follows the StarWars franchise genre, with endless sequels and more and more substanceless, a kind of chewing gum for the eyes.",4
2251,"The music, the dialogue, the acting in some parts the storyline the effects.I can't believe what I watched. Compared to the originals this was such a disappointment.The score was absolutely missing that punch, we all remember propellor head scene, there was 0 of that in this one, even the final song, where is that punchy original? A remake was put in place which lacked originality. And in some parts it felt like tones where added for cringe.The action, shake the camera anymore add you'll have people watching the film puking. Not only where the action scenes lacking that true grit action, the way they were shot was confusing, a punch starts here and the next cut is someone firing a gun, there is no flow. They certainly didn't have me at the edge of the seat.Acting, while the original actors did a decent job acting some scenes where just hard to watch, like there wasn't a bad actor, just a bad take. More could have been pushed out it feels. The French guy stands out here, he did a great job in the old film but here it was cringe, but I add that to the lack of quality screenplay, after the fight scene the French guy blabbers something and the filming just feels so off that it has an affect on the acting, the cuts, the music and the flow of the film, all in one.Cuts, st the beginning the lady jumps onto a street sign and it cuts to her fingers slamming the lights bulbs along the lit street banner/sign and I ask myself, why is that being shown? Do I need to see her fingers up close while she slams the light bulbs, it felt so unnatural and made me aware of scene cuts, which is the opposite of what good scene cutting should do.It's just feels like there could have been more done with this film, it had so much potential. The story line I just say had something within it, neo and trinity being bonded was an excellent touch. A good way to move forward. I can imagine there will be more matrix's and I hope the feedback is heard an adapted for the next films as I love this franchise, I grew up with it.",4
2252,"The Matrix Resurrections is a movie that is a breath of fresh air in a horde of rehashed remakes, sequels, and reboots. Lana Wachowski makes a strong statement about her vision about her Matrix. Right off the bat she declares that Matrix is a philosophical movie. As you are watching the movie, you realize that the movie is pretty much devoid of action- at least the great action that the Matrix movies are known for. Her point being that the action doesn't matter which is a strong statement about the state of superhero movie culture today. The philosophical aspects of the Matrix is what reigns supreme in the movie. Lana makes a movie about love. The new talent in the movie are great especially Morpheus and Bugs. The cast is likable. The visit to zion is interesting. What bugged me the most about the movie is just the general low-stakes. Keanu and Carrie Ann Moss are great. An interesting and different sequel from Lana Wachowski.",8
2253,"Who thought of the name Bugs for the white rabbit girl, a producer's 10 year old kid? Seriously, this movie was horrible. 1/3 of it was over-played reminders of Matrix 1, bad action scene editing, plot that isn't followed through favoring instead to showing old scenes, needless recasting of Morpheus and Smith. A huge flop for me. I was left with zero urge to want to continue the story.",1
2254,"Movie starts off really compelling and feels like it is something that has been thought out and planned for a long time. Then the second and third act feel really pointless and bland.

2255,"I have never written a review for anything but I was compelled to with this one. Being a hardcore fan of the Matrix trilogy, especially the first Matrix, I was so hyped about this movie.

2257,"What the hell did they do that for?!?Anything that was good about The Matrix is completely gone in this movie. The script is just laughable, where's the action? Where's the story? If you thought the third movie was bad, you ain't seen nothin' yet.......",2
2258,Watch the first 30 mins- it gives you all the answers ya need. When the production company that owns the rights to the movie (WB) comes and demands a sequel with or without you- what can you do?In this case- the answer should have been no. Just felt like a mockery of the original. I'm surprised Keanu signed up for it.,1
2259,"Nothing about resurrections feels like a Matrix movie. There's no grit, no drama, no emotion, just cheap action movie filmed at all the wrong angles. I wouldn't be surprised if none of the crew/effects teams haven't seen the trilogy.The only enjoyable parts of the movie are the callbacks to the past which is not enough to carry the movie.",2
2260,Such a disepointments! Lazy movie making in every way which is not remotely compared to the original.. Yet again another frenchise is being distroyed! It seams they have had a fraction of the budget to create this one.. I would not bother..,1
2261,"""The Matrix Resurrections"" is the fourth installment of the ""Matrix"" film franchise. Once again starring Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in the lead roles, it offers entertaining actions scenes that the series is best known for but also more of the same confusing plot elements.Decades after the events of ""The Matrix Revolutions"", Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) works as a video game developer, having created a successful trilogy of games based on his dreams of when he was called ""Neo"". During his time working in San Francisco, Anderson frequents a coffee shop where he often spots a woman named Tiffany, who bears a striking resemblance to Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). Struggling to separate his dreams from his current reality, Anderson starts seeing a therapist (Neil Patrick Harris) who prescribes him blue pills to help retain a feeling of normality. Eventually, Anderson decides to stop taking the pills, which only causes his perception of the world around him to diminish further.The impact of the ""Matrix"" series on both pop culture and action films in general cannot be overstated. Even more than twenty years after the original came out, its influence can still be felt today in virtually every action movie released since. While the 2003 sequels were a mixed bag at best, they still had their fair share of memorable moments that have helped the franchise endure on as long as it has. Now after eighteen years, ""Resurrections"" returns us to the simulated world of the Matrix with most of the things that made the originals so fun to watch, along with all of the puzzling parts as well.During the first act, the film makes some not-so-subtle meta references to how popular the ""Matrix"" series has been all this time by using Neo's video games as a stand-in for the franchise as a whole. Neo's co-workers all try to dissect the true meaning of what the series is actually about, but each time someone comes up with a plausible theory, another person introduces something different that contradicts the previous one. Regardless, they all seem to agree that what has been created here is a ""game changer"" and should be treated with a great deal of respect. To me, these were the best dialogue scenes in the whole movie because it's amusing to see what the writers must feel like when fans come up to them to ask if their interpretations of the films are correct.As for the rest of the film's dialogue, it's all the same overly complicated exposition that feels like a chore to follow along. It is especially exacerbated by the fact that this film is not a reboot that takes newcomers into account but actually direct sequel that relies heavily on the audience's prior knowledge of the previous films. This has always been problematic in the original trilogy so it's annoying that the writers haven't learned from this after all these years.If there were just one thing to watch a ""Matrix"" film for, it would be the first rate actions scenes. Blended with those signature visual effects known as ""bullet time"", this film has plenty of shoot-outs and hand-to-hand combat that are on the same level as the originals, albeit, nowhere near as memorable. I'm certain most people will remember that iconic scene in the first film where Neo is dodging several bullets in slow motion on top of a building or that scene in ""Reloaded"" where he stops bullets in front of him by simply raising his hand, causing them to fall to the ground. This film contains similar scenes, and while they're still entertaining, they just don't have the same visceral impact today as several years ago. I suppose it could be chalked up to how almost every action movie since 1999 has been so heavily influenced by the ""Matrix"" series that it is hard to be wowed by moments like this anymore, despite this being the franchise that started it all.Seeing Keanu Reeves return to what is arguably his most iconic role after almost twenty years is quite surreal. It's like watching a beloved superhero come out of retirement to put on their trademark costume to save the world one last time. As I am sure most are aware, Reeves looks much younger than his actual age so he's still pretty convincing when we see him throw hands and dodge bullets with his enemies. Then again, Reeves already proved he's still got it years ago in the ""John Wick"" films, which definitely helped him out of a career slump. In addition to Reeves, it's also nice to see Carrie-Anne Moss reprise her role as Trinity again. Trinity was always an important ally for Neo and I don't think the film could have worked had Moss not returned to play the character.Unfortunately, these are the only returning actors from the originals as Laurence Fishburne has been replaced by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Morpheus and Hugo Weaving has been replaced by Jonathan Groff as Agent Smith. Although there is a logical explanation within the film's plot as to why this is the case, it still doesn't sit right with me to see Reeves and Moss reprise their roles while Fishburne and Weaving do not. That's not to say Abdul-Mateen and Groff are terrible in their respective roles, it's just that it never felt as though I was truly seeing these characters return after so long. If they were playing brand new characters I wouldn't have minded too much, but the problem here is that we are frequently shown flashbacks to the previous films with the intent to juxtapose them with their original counterparts, which didn't really work out.Compared to most belated sequels of this nature, ""The Matrix Resurrections"" isn't anywhere near as bad as it could have been, though it does little to justify its existence. It's a serviceable continuation that neither insults the series' legacy nor adds anything ""game changing"" to its lore. Personally, I think the series should have stayed as a trilogy, but in this world of movie studios reviving old franchises for a quick buck, it was inevitable that something as iconic as ""The Matrix"" would end up receiving this type of treatment. At least with the film's self-aware humour, the writers are able to see the funny side of it.I rate it 6.5/10.",7
2262,"Everyone just loves to complain, apparently! M1 is an audacious work of genius and I well-tolerated M2 and M3 (though the latter two were appreciably weaker outings) and liked the Animatrix. After reading some of M-R's reviews I worried that M-R (aka M4) would turn out like the dreadful Dune2021 or M1:M4 would be to Alien:Prometheus. I thoroughly enjoyed M4 even though it's not a flawless outing and many folks will complain about how it ends. Key problems (without revealing spoilers): 1) NPH gets way, way too preachy...reminds me of the 20 pages of philosophical monologue that Ayn Rand inserted into Atlas Shrugged; 2) Fan Service to M1 is over-the-top; 3) One key character acts against character for no reason I can discern in a major turn of events; 4) Some sizable plot holes in the 2nd half. Still, I was totally engrossed, especially in the 1st half. Beautiful special effects.",8
2263,"Our world is in a very different place now from when the original film was released, and this movies message feels timely. The loudest voices in the room these days seem to be those longing for fascism that is wrapped in a guise of personal freedom &amp; nationalism - AS USUAL. These days - fascism is supposed to be trendy as long as its your own party. But the beauty of democracy is government should not over reach laws just because it finds them inconvenient to the ability to maintain power. In democracy the government evolves as the voters do because majority is supposed to rule. Dictators creep in when people surrender their will to a candidate... forsaking laws. There is a line in the movie when the character Sheperd says, ""Everything was simpler back then. People wanted to be free. It's different now. Sometimes it feels like people gave up. Like the Matrix won."" And so here we are...",10
2264,The new Matrix Resurrections movie is definitely a good movie to see this one to see. You will like it. It is definitely way better than the other Matrix movies.,10
2265,"That is the only thing I have to say. The effects are cool but that's about it. This is LAME. I am so upset they do this nonsense of a movie, I was so excited for this and honestly I would advise not to spend money on the cinema.",4
2266,"Better we got another one like Animatrix. Why we have ao many actors from Sense8? It seems like the movie is very low budget.This is the worst Matrix out there. Such a shame since it has some good ideas. The acting is not good, just as with Sense8.",3
2267,"There are 2 kind of people. Matrix fans and all the rest. And if you cannot understand a thing of the 4th movie, it appears you are not a fan. The movie is a pure 10.",10
2268,"Like a star wars episode 7 this is the same story with added characters. No plot, no twists, just a tribute to previous parts with added scenes from previous parts. Kianu is acting like he needed to not like he wanted to.",4
2269,Waisted my damn time. I wanted to walk out of my house. The movie tried too hard and it felt like it catered to a younger audience. The story line was weak and didn't capture my interest. I sought the full picture to give me a resurgence of past nostalgic remembrance but it fell short of remembrance.,1
2270,"Compared to the original Matrix, 3/10 is a gift. The action scenes are dull and there is no point. The very philosophy of the original disappeared like a fart in the wind a long time ago and the only thing that interests me is how they managed to make the original one. Now I can say with certainty that I will avoid their films in the future. The matrix was so good that I gave them a chance many times but this is it.",2
2271,The first is a masterpiece and defined a generation. This one is unwatchable-It feels like a bad made for tv movie. Hugo and Lawrence were smart not being in this soon to be Razzie award winner. Jupiter Ascending and Battlefield Earth are more fun to watch than this. What else can I say negative to meet the 150 character minimum that I haven't already said? I am just glad I did not pay for it.,1
2272,"Where to start...from the poster? Like from a sci-fi series. The script? Like from a mild budget sci-fi series. Overall feeling? Like from a bad sci-fi series. Fighting scenes? Not even believable for a sci-fi series. The idea was OK and how everything was going to go but then it was purged, as they say in the film.",6
2273,Waited 20 years for this movie and it was such a let down. I hated everything about it. The story must have been written by a child. The acting and fight choreography sucked. The original movie movies were masterpieces.,1
2274,"Everything the original trilogy is not, including exciting. A slow burn to nothingness, coming from nothingness. A wonderful opportunity to make a great movie, lost. The movie has no great journey, no true North.",1
2275,"It is basically mocking the previous movies. I cant believe it could be so bad. Are they even trying? I didnt even watch the whole thing. Seen 1,2 and 3 many times over and over. This will not happen again with this.",3
2276,"To summarize that could be a good movie, but unfortunately, it's very very awful.I hope that Keanu Reeves won't read any bad reviews. He was good, he did his best, we all see his input.The scenario wasn't that bad. However a lot of trash that could be cut and no one would notice.But holy cow how bad it was shot? It was just shot poorly. Poor quality picture, bad editing, wrong lenses, wrong angles, acting looked bad because of wrong directing and again wrong equipment. All of that made movie look cheap. It looks like one expensive tv-show but not a Matrix movie. Can't believe it, but the trilogy looks 100 times better from all aspects.Then we move to the sound. What is wrong with music and sounds? How is that even possible to made it sound like any low budget tv show?2/10But I watched only half of the movie, couldn't go further.",2
2277,End was mehh i was expecting so much more from this then what it produced . I wanted to see more about the real world and how they would actually destroy the machines i was waiting for it and then they left it so that it was open to a 5th movie i don't know i like some of it and then at ending. Watch it everyone has different opinions i just think they should of not made a 4th.,5
2278,"Firstly, if you have delved into some of the mythology behind the how and why of the story, this should be a fascinating story. For the casual viewer, keeping an open mind and just enjoying the details within this movie are great.The juxtaposition of the original trilogy vs the meta storyline has provided an interesting chapter. Lana has definitely grown as a storyteller and filmmaker...This is a very good movie that is full of so many details to make it rewatchable.",8
2279,"Well, I can understand why fans are disappointed, but I reckon that their expectations from the first movie will never be matched.This movie copied Night Shyamalan's Glass plot trying to make believe that Neo had imagined the events from the previous movies all along. And the result is actually a dull copy which is another reason why fans might be disappointed.On the contrary, I was not expecting anything and basically enjoyed a rather slow-paced but good action film. Of course, the avatars are resurrected ; what else could have been expected ?! Of course, Neo and Trinity end up playing Adam and Eve ! There is nothing new and the script actually brags about it.",7
2280,"Not really clear on why so many disliked this movie. Yes, the first 30 or so minutes is a bit of a rehash of the first movie, but that's the point.Overall it's a fantastic movie that is well worth watching. I loved the trilogy and this new sequel is a wonderful addition.",10
2281,"It was okay. Surprising story for a new entry in the new trilogy of things to come yet. Weak OST. Worst imitation of rage against the machines. Also the score lacks the matrix soul with a terrible score without Don Davis making his return debut. So Juno reactor is now absent in making pounding techno trance sounds like how the matrix was supposidly ment to be. Could of gotten junkie XL to score this and that would have definately made the films moods far more better. He probably could have done a far better remix theme for this movie. The film has lost its touch mainly the green tint that never made its comeback for when they enter the matrix. The cast other than neo, trinity and niobe surely brings a fresh new life to the matrix franchise for todays generation. Sure the original matrix was how many years ago? Welcome back, to the new matrix system. Yeah okay. It has some possitives and some negatives. Its lost its edge... the toneage has gone. That true menacing feeling when a sense of threat is gonna happen. The true suspense and questionable decisions that has to be made or has already been decided for him/her/them. Buts sure i knew this was gonna be how they would resurrect Neo and trinity. I would have thought the wackowski's would make this a new dawn of a dark chapter. Maybe make neo the biggest nemesis of all and such. But i wa wrong. Neo's style of acting seems uncanny and not so solid and very heavily scripted. And it really shows. In his and trinity's role making the story too fluffybunny. The over use on moder technology is like watching why? I like the mysteries surrounding the encoded messages that is mostly unkonwn to many and they just sense if its bad or not. I also didnt like how its a cheap imitation of the first film making a mockery of a legacy, a true legacy that invented it all. The future of the matrix just seams like a big one time joke. The CGI and Visuals are an amazing improvement and so worth taking advantage of with todays technology standards. The biggest issue is they left the film far too long and tey have just dropped this into our screens eliminiting any form of connections to the matrix revolutions with out a clear enough picture of how neo managed to get himself jacked permanently into the matrix by the big guy in machine city. Also it does not explain this new smith well enough also the current actor does not have the same heart and soul and depth of insanity and darkness about him in comparison to agent smith. I find the new smith and absolutely corny and lame. The train scene is the worst scene since the amazing freeway chase and ambush from the amazing matrix reloaded. Instead its just corny and lacks depth of soul and toneage that had its standards set after revolutions. I still think the original morpheus and smith could have kicked ass as much as neo and trinity. And i dont think they should have pushed for a far into the future scrapping everything and and pushed for a new standard. The shrink stuff thats just such a poor atempt to add to the solutions. Also niobe's acting was stiff and so unnecessary. The didnt have to kill of the old crew yet as the actors from reloaded still could have been in this feature. If they stayed true to the original trilogy this film would have been a hella lot stronger pitch than it is... sorry keanu and carrie but this is not what i would have had in mind for this story for you guys as returning lose sequel... its like watching timecop and ignoring what happend and going to timecop 2... hopefully matrix resurrections 2 is much better... maybe neo kills this new smith and and then the original comes back meaner and wreckless as usual. Maybe neo and trin becomes everyones new nemesis in the system and is worse than smith... and tries to kill everyone in the real world under the new hidden control undercover from the machnes as infiltration for a new all out war. And then niobe seriously pisses her pants and has something real to fight for again. Like i said this love story is too fluffybunnies. When will we have a meaning to fight for the new matrix or are they gonna revert back to the original world. Also who ever thought about the ending should be shot, saked. Seriously do us fans have to be taken as a joke with a poor sense of humour that was entirely cringe. X2... i would rather say stick to the original trilogy until they have fixed the meaning of the matrix. And not made it another wokefest. This film resurrections is kinda humiliating to watch all throughouts...",5
2282,"The first 20 minutes are great. It felt very Matrixy, questioning reality and making statements on our society and art. They even have a hole section speaking about the expectations of making a good vs. Bad sequel. And then... It just... Becomes a bad sequel. It really weirds me out. It so strongly felt like they had a plan, that when it became such a bad movie I just thought: ""Is this intentional? Is this Meta? Is this just a Red Hearing so it can become really good afterwards?"". And the movie dragged and dragged, and bad exposition just kept coming, and fanservice started rolling and new the characters remained bad, and then came the ending. And I just stood there, questioning if I had really seen the movie, or if this was just a distraction and in fact there there is actually another version of the movie that is actually good, and if I knew it was a distraction, and the director knew, and the director knew that I knew, and if I knew that the director knew that I knew then maybe this is actually the real movie, but it the director knew that I knew that the director knew that I knew maybe it isn't and... what? It isn't? It is just a soulless movie? But... How? I thought you planned even the tinniest detail of this movies, I thought you guys had a plan, you made an entire segment making fun or soulless sequels and then... Go on and make one? By all means it just don't make sense? Is this a statement? The made fun of Warner Brothers, is this an act of revenge by the director? It doesn't feels like it. I don't know what the hell is going on, is that the point? Is this a statement about me? What is going on?",5
2283,"Don't say too much because It's very hard not to spoil this movie, so I'm just going to tell, that it's awesome. The acting is great, Keanu Reeves and Anne-Carrie are great and so is Neil Patrick Harris.The script is extremely well thought off and works like a charm. The effects are not over the top like the 2nd and 3rd movies where it got too much, these are just right.Matrix 4 is just as great as the first one. Watch it.",10
2284,"This could have been a great movie, but it's not. I'm just sad..story is to thin and not dark enough. It shouldn't have been made. I was forcing myself to finish watching it.",3
2285,"It was a risky decision but I feel like it didn't go wrong.Instead of giving us what we expected. The movie is more like a meeting with fans of the saga.The movie does not take itself seriously many times and breaks the fourth wall. But this is not just for joking, there is a lot of criticism of the industry and the lifestyle of these times.So that's my warning, don't see them waiting for matrix 4. See it more as a reunion with the saga where we can joke and comment while we watch it.",6
2286,"If you are a fan of the original series, I do not recommend watching this movie. The dialogues are cliched, the characters lackluster. Visual effects are boring.Synopsis: An attempt to make some money for a production company using a resonant name.",1

2288,"I had to turn it off... I was so bored. As much as I love Keanu and the first Matrix movie, I was so excited for this one...but was so disappointed! I really tried guys.. I really did.",1
2289,"I'm a big fan of the Matrix ever since I saw the first one. Even though the second and third film went good, I still enjoyed them because I wanted to see how this amazing concept concluded. So to me 2and3 served that purpose to help end it. With Resurrection, I don't understand how Neo is back or why? They are making some of the old events absolute, like from the third film. Honestly I didn't even finish this movie because is also too long with nothing happening. Neo keeps saying""this can't be happening"" half of the movie. Don't get me started on the new Agent Smith , they should have tried something new, maybe a new Agent. Agent Smith from the trilogy can't be replaced. This new Agent Smith is lame as hell, the direction of the movie didn't help him at all. Neo's reactions to him are so dull. He be like ""Smith"", and Smith calls them predictable. Predictable how, idk. I think this movie was just a money grab and was made because of the hype over Keanu Reeves due to the Wick franchise.",2
2290,"I decided to watch this a second time since after the first viewing I thought it was just okey. On second viewing I think it's average and not up to the standard of the original trilogy. I'm a hardcore Matrix fan, I loved the originals, the first movie was always my favourite but I always really enjoyed the 2nd and 3rd too.This movie felt very different in comparison. It lacked the intensity and excitement compared to the others such as the car chase or Neo fighting off hundreds of Smiths. The action scenes were just ok too. Nothing really memorable in my opinion. The movie could have done with more action. Also nobody dies? Or even seems to come close to dying... an example of how this movie lacked the excitement compared to the originals.I would have preferred if they had brought back some of the original actors, especially for the exile programs... I'd have loved to have seen the twins!I appreciated the current social commentary from the analyst but overall I felt like this was more of a love story between Neo and Trinity. It was nice to see them come together but I also was happy with the ending of the third and didn't need to see a continuation.I was very excited when this movie was announced, I'd be very skeptical and pessimistic now if there are any more sequels announced.",6
2291,"Boring.Lazy writing, wooden acting, and don't get me started on the fight scenes, I be seen way better in a B list movie.This film is why you should leave some things alone.The first film was amazing, all the rest got progressively worse, this one, was amazingly bad.Honestly, if you loved the first film, don't bother with this one.",2
2292,"It went in a different direction than I imagined. Although it could have ironed out a few things better and it used the battery thing again, I still liked it. In fact, I will watch it again. I'm not sure if it will hold up with repeat viewing. But, for now, I find it to be a fun ride.",7
2293,"Honestly the references to previous matrix movies were done so badly. What is that first matrix being projected on the wall? That looked so bad. What was that dialogue by Morpheus ""Nothing like nostalgia to relieve some anxiety?"".How can the script go from ""Neel is taking blue pills"" to ""OK let's just go save trinity""...What the hell is Neel's fights doing force pushes.. The entire thing felt shallow and cringe. Humour used in such creep way.. It was not cool.Finishing the film with a bad version of RATM song was offensive and the overall soundtrack was so childish... What a disappointment.",1
2294,"Third act saves the movie.Why all Studios have to Reboot and jeopardize every single well constructed Franchise?Matrix Resurrection is not bad... but it just seems unnecessary.The storyline is shallow and there is no character development. Consequently, the first act is based upon nostalgic and almost a new and remastered view of the first movie.Additionally, most the action scenes are bad and disappointing. It is expected that the CGI of nowadays woud give better resources for the directors to produce a better solution for the sequences. However, it feels like the movie it made in 2006, and has the same old features of the original trilogy. (ps: also the abuse of slow motion is something that is annoying for this new one.... you can say it is a part of the unique approach of the Matrix franchise, but still feels different and more ""forced"" into a bad rhythm).Comversely, the third act, and some of the solution within the new city, are well constructed.Therefore, precisely, is the interaction between the Trinity, and Neo that makes up for the main idea of the movie. This is good but still feels like a ""forced"" and badly arranged reason for the sacrifice of the new city (""Io)"".Finally, Matrix Resurrections, is a movie that drinks up on a good nostalgic fountain, however it just feels like is missing something... considering that there was little (almost none) character development, and little introduction of the new fleet of characters for the future.For me, this is a perfect example, of how Studios, and there will to Reboot and make money off the so called ""named"" franchises, can destroy or jeopardize some legacies!",5
2295,"In some ways, The Matrix Resurrections is commendable. The story has uniqueness, themes, self-awareness, and clarity. The technical aspects are above-average and craft is implemented on all levels. The camerawork is cinematic, the editing shines during action and montages, the sound gets abstract, the effects are multifaceted, and the production design is substantial. The cast members are good and their performances all work. Yet, despite all this, Resurrections comes across as a muddled mess because it's goals are tired, contradictory, and unmotivated. Simply put, this movie is missing the passion of its predecessors.The biggest issue is the script. While unusual, it relapses into the exhausted focus of Neo saving Trinity. While self-aware and thematic, it doesn't follow through with any of these ideas. While clear, it gets distracted with superfluous characters and concepts. Meanwhile, the filmmaking lacks the pop of the original trilogy. The imagery is less distinct, the runtime is bloated, the sound lacks style, the music isn't memorable, and the production design feels hollow. Overall, Resurrections just doesn't seem confident in itself and misses a strong vision. The film has its virtues, but mostly feels like a drained retread.Writing: 4/10Direction: 5/10Cinematography: 7/10Acting: 7/10Editing: 7/10Sound: 7/10Score/Soundtrack: 7/10Production Design: 7/10Casting: 7/10Effects: 7/10Overall Score: 6.5/10.",7
2296,I feel bad for writing this but I grew up with this movie and I didn't even recognize it. Why explain the first 3 movies to true fans.. This movie is an attempt at a remake and a sequel at the same time. Seriously go back and watch the first one and count the similarities.,1
2297,This movie made no sense. The original 3 was something new that pushed the envelope. This Matrix was almost like 100th episode special of your favorite tv show or Greatest Hits Album. Just going over past hits but nothing original. The characters of Matrix 4 had no point to them. They were just placements so that the viewer can rehash the previous installments. I really wanted to like this movie but I'm hoping they don't make another. So sad.,2
2298,I couldn't give this film more than 10 minutes. The effects are bland are instantly you're taught to not care about any of the characters. Unfortunately this movie is clearly just a quick cash grab. Hard pass on this one.,1
2299,This movie felt like a parody.Like the directors didn't even want to make it.I was expecting a story backed with action.Both were missing.It was usual woke dialogues.I think wachowski brothers need to introspect.Goodday.,1
2300,"After an hour I decided to stop watching it. This move should not be release as some things have a behinong and an end. This is just a clumsy reboot with adequate ideas that can potentially harm the franchise in the future.Idiotic and funny characters, bad story and poor acting by most of the secondary actors destroyed the movie completely. It resembles the story of Star Wars when Disney took over.It's almost like the creators have lost their minds and are living in a poor imagined colorful world.",4
2301,"Stopped my car on my way home from the theatre to start writing this. I'm just baffled this was what was made. Was in the movies with my father in law who is a big scifi fantast. We and everyone we talked to after the movie agree that this movie should never have been made, the story, acting, plot, cinematography - everything is so bad that people started laughing at it. One man fell asleep and i personally cringed through like 40% of the film. If you liked the first three movies, or even just any of them... don't watch this. Keanu and Carrie-Annes acting is below par also, feels like they didn't want to do this.",1
2302,"This could be the 'Rocky II' of 'The Matrix Revolutions'. While 'Revolutions' ended on a gloomy and tragic note and 'Resurrections' is the complete opposite: It gives a happy (and well deserved) send off to Neo and Trinity -as she says, now they hace something they never thought they could ever have: another chance-. And that's the best and most remarkable part of this fourth entry, one that's the worst of the series largely due to a jarring plot, lame jokes (Neo jumping when he tries to fly is literally an insult to the character very much like 'The Last Jedi' or 'Rise Of Skywalker', which is funny because this movie could 'The Matrix Awakenings') and a rehash of the first movie and many other moments and twists we have seen before much better. Even Niobe is awfully misplaced in the storyline.But even with all this ranting, I was never bored. Despite all the extremely noticeable weaknesses, Reeves and Moss Carry the movie on their shoulders, its self referential stuff has some interesting scenes and the final chase is cool enough. The magic and the surprise is gone, but Hope replaces darkness and despite being the weakest of all this movie manages to be on par thanks to a much better and satisfying pay off to its two main characters. Maybe too happy for some, but they deserved it. Such a shame the movie (and even more so, the script) wasn't as good as them. I Hope there isn't a fifth one, better leave the franchise and the Neo/Trinity story here.",6
2303,As a Matrix fan I am massively disappointed. I really liked the entire trilogy but this one was too painful to watch. There was no intensity in the movie at all.. I found myself waiting for it to end. Just as terrible as the new Terminator movie.,4
2304,"This felt like a bad parody, like a mix of Scary Movie and Bollywood's Robot (Enthiran).And the casting is even worse. Laurence Fishburne is unavailable? No problem, let's cast a random black dude as Morpheus and say that inside the matrix you can look different. But he has to be outside too. Oh? No problem let's make him into a bunch of black marbles robot. The do the same of Agent Smith... And throw in some social media and smartphones, you know because it's 2021...I want my 2 and half hours back!",1
2305,"This was definitely the worst of the Matrix movies. The first movie was good, the second was so and so and the third was good with the action scenes. Although the third movie left us with a cliffhanger and a bunch of questions we were always hoping for a fourth movie to tie off loose ends. However, this movie feels like a love story that added zombies into it. This was unimaginative and bland.",4
2306,"Right in the first 15 minutes they explain that this is just an attempt by Warner Brothers to make more money of the franchise. Quite literally in a dedicated scene. Hollywood honesty at its best.The rest of the movie feels like a mocumentary on the story of the first Matrix. Wicht makes it the only movie known to me to have an After-Credit scene with a plot better than the entire movie.So, if you endured to the end credits, stay for the scene at the end. It will explain a lot about the plot.",2
2307,"It is painful to watch, however I admit, there are a few painkiller jokes in it.Overall, the story moved nowhere, the characters evolved nowhere. They did the same tricks, just gotten older. The best act is from Deja Vu. Not going to spoil that for you here.15% 2 hour long movie was actual episodes of Matrix 1-2-3 for recap, and an other 25% was a remake of Matrix 1 with different actors, same scenes.",4
2308,"I am a BIG fan of the original trilogy. The later two installments of the original trio get rightful considerable flak for not being up to the mark, but they still are worth the watch.It felt like this movie was made to pay a gambling debt. It felt like Lana guilt tripped Keanu and the cast to be in this movie. Everyone in this movie looked like they were in agony. The fighting scenes were worse than that of an indie movie made by a bunch of high school kids. The storyline was extremely forced. The scene clips from the original were distasteful and mostly unnecessary.The two stars are for the cast. It was fun to see Keanu and the rest of the original cast again on the big screen and the casting of Jessica Henwick and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was nice. Jonathan Groff could have done better but he had Big shoes to fill. The expectations from Agent Smith extremely hard to meet!",2
2309,"No spoilers..I'll start off by saying I so wanted this movie to be good. The prospect of having another Matrix movie after so many years and the fact that two lead actors were returning had me very excited from the moment I heard about it. If Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss both signed up, it must mean it was worth the wait...right?HUUUUGE fan of the franchise. Marathon-watched the whole trilogy leading in to watching Resurrections. To say it was a let down would be an understatement. The film seemed lazily thrown together relying on viewers' nostalgia to carry the film. Frequent overuse of clips from the first three films felt like a desperate attempt to force the audience to make connections rather than let us connect the dots ourselves. Much of the appeal of the first three films is the use of theology and philosophy as building blocks of the story and source of much of the intriguing, well-thought-out dialogue. The Architect. The wisdom and guidance of the Oracle and Morpheus. The quick-witted banter between Smith and Neo. Resurrections missed the mark on this aspect COMPLETELY. It was insulting. It was as if it was dumbed down for an audience that is no longer willing or able to think for themselves. It felt like a ""Matrix for Dummies"" manual. Keanu's and Carrie-Anne's performances were not stellar but not bad. The rest of the cast was unremarkable, given the script. I had expected that much of the story would focus on the explanation behind Neo's and Trinity's return, which seemed rushed and dismissive of the core audience's yearning for this answer.Ultimately, this film was a slap in the face, patronizing to fans of the original films and condescending to the younger audience.",1
2310,"BAD STUFF1) Those cheap flashbacks to the old movies. Far too many. Really not necessary.2) The whole digital filming. (The charm of 35MM is gone)3) I'm missing Laurence and Hugo. (I missed you both!)4) That bad make up on Jada. (Her face doesn't move at all - or do they have botox in Zion as well?)5) Confusing edited action sequences (the other movies were much sharper and interesting cut and edited, this was a mess sometimes)6) Those new characters (who were they? What were their names? Did anybody care?)7) storyline (or were it just some cool scenes, few which were copy/paste from the old movies).GOOD STUFF1) Jonathan Groff was one of the only new actors who could convince me (although his storyline was quite confusing to me).2) was that Christina Ricci? (Give the girl some more)3) Action sequences (whatever I said above, they are still cool).4) I did sometimes have that old Matrix-feeling back (but then it slipped back down the rabbit hole).5) First hour was the weirdest, but the strongest (then it all went nowhere).6) Glad Lara still took the directing up to her (I mean who else would've made a bigger mess? Michael Bay??)7) Ending leaves it open to more... and I am still open to more.CONCLUSIONNo, this wasn't the best The Matrix movie, but it was a different one, and clearly a movie who wants to set the tone and opening for a new trilogy. Although it missed a lot of heart from the old ones, I still did enjoy myself. But, it can't go down from here guys... so pick up the writing skills and make sure the editing/music is back to where it was before.",6
2311,"A swarm of bad reviews, and I believe this people are only basing their view on a basic perspective. You need to truly undestand the meaning of the matrix to get the full message of this new window of perspective that Lana Wachowski it's trying to articulate with the narrative and the characters.",10
2312,"I gave this movie a 2 star and would have given it 1 start but I did get some quality sleep while trying to watch it so it earned 2.This had to be the biggest waste of time watching a movie I have spent in a long time. There are some movies that should just be left in the past.I am so disappointed. I am trying not to give away any spoilers so I won't say much, but please do us a favor and don't try to make another one. :)",2
2313,"So I didn't totally expect that I'd like this one. It was good, not terrible, not great, kind of what you expect from a sequel/reboot... I get that they were playing on Neo being older, but man did he look like he was having a tough time in every fight scene... I feel like he was supposed to look this way or it could of been bad choreography... because in John Wick, Keanu never looks like he's having a bad go in a fight.The movie seemed really rushed as far as the story goes, like they had to throw something together really quick to get into production. Again it wasn't bad, but it felt super factory Hollywood.... Honestly I'd like to see a prequel movie on how the Matrix comes to be lol but obviously that movie can't be made because there would be no happy ending. Even a movie where the Matrix is actually brought down, I don't know something fresh... the same old ""we're in the Matrix"" bs can't go on.7 for the actors, I liked all the new people, especially Smith and Morpheus5 for the story... obviously this wasn't written over the last 20 years, it probably took them a few months if that.10 for special effects, it's hard to mess this part up now a days.If it has a 5th installment, they need to get writers who have dreams and creativity.Also thank god they got rid of that stupid green tint that was used gracefully in the first movie, but washed over the second and third movies.",7
2314,"Not sure what I just saw. Wouldn't even call it a movie. Feel bad for Keanu reeves. I've waited 3 or 4 years for this to come out. I saw the original in the theater the night it came out. I was 14, sat in the front row cause it was packed. We turned resurrection off when he fought ""Morpheus"" in training sequence. After the nausea dissipated, I almost fell asleep. Don't even watch it.",1
2315,"I watched expecting nothing and still I was disappointed how bad it was. Cgi is not the best, the few fight scenes are embarrassing where most of the fight scenes are taken only from the actors' torso, the blows have no impact, stupid comedy, bad dialogue... Warner giving another shot on his own foot.",3

2317,"Keanu said he didn't play cyberpunk 2077, now he has to say he didn't play a role in the Matrix Resurrection. Completely waste of time, far behind original trilogy.",1
2318,"This movie is HILARIOUS! You just need to look at it from the right angle.As a sequel and sci-fi movie it's horrible. Predictable crazy regurgitation of old stuff.But look at it from the perspective of a writer and actors who didn't want to do the movie. The dialogue throughout the entire movie could be associated with some unhappy people who were forced to do there movie due to some legal requirement. The whole back and forth throughout the movie perfectly represents an argument, pleading, resignation, realization, revolt, and finally a big show off.There is a point where they almost precisely tell the producers to shove the red pill somewhere unpleasant.I laughed so hard my chest hurt. 🤡😆😅",10
2319,"Why oh why did they make this? It has no value to the original matrix story, it doesn't provide any new entertainment in terms of visuals compared to any new action movie, acting is, well, bad...

2320,"Matrix 1 was inspiring, unique, new, first time, different and so much more...The sequels were at least continuing the legacy, not entirely amazingly but at least the action was legendaryResurrections is so bad at its action that the first movie seems better and considering it's 20 years old, still better.From the story point of view, if after 20 years, the Wachowski came up with this for a continuation. I assume Lana was high when suggesting the idea and Warner Bros were desperate for a legend movie for the yearTerrible to the core that I gave up an hour into the movie and had to force myself to watch the remainderAbsolute shambles.",2
2321,"I didn't have high expectations, but this. Looked like a mockery of the first three movies. Characters that were essential to the plot and gave it a lot of weight are now caricatures of themselves. Neil Patrick Harris is a good comedian, but he is not THE Architect, Merovingian and Smith - hahaha, and Morpheus a robot! Even 20 years later Reeves acting is as wooden as ever - hasn't this guy learned the basics of acting? The plot itself - unoriginal and uninspiring! Lacks the philosophy, the magic and vision of the first Matrix movie. How this movie gets 10/10 is beyond me. Why did Lana decide to obliterate her own legacy with this c*ap?",1
2322,"Took my mom to see this today, 1-4-21. I kept falling asleep. My mom said she kept falling asleep. The CGI was worse then what they used in 1999. Characters were lame. Plot was super lame.

2325,Do no bother with this movie. It breaks the fourth wall and relies too much on rehashed footage from the previous films. There is no element of anything at stake and ruined well established characters from the originals.,1

2327,Why do a sequel two decades later without Hugo or Lawrence? Trinity is basically on the bench the entire movie and the big bad is Neil Patrick Harris. This movie feels like the 57th script idea.,2

I appreciate that new meaning, but it feels like this movie could have been done much better. In some ways.Probably, this movie is an answer to those studios that own ""rights"" on intellectual properties. It's an answer to those studios that probably want to make money by exploiting the sacred and dear art pieces of old days.Many are ""shortsighted"" these days. Will it come to a world war once? Will there be a cleaning of ""too shortsighted"" errors of nature or we will be just passively fading away until it's too late? Maybe I'm too shortsighted to see the value of ""The Matrix: Resurrections""?Thanks for the efforts anyway.",6

2332,I have been waiting for this premiere. After I began watching I realized it had been too long since the last one and I tried to remember or understand the premise.I just don't remember BUT I do know I could only watch 20 minutes. Just watching all the shooting and ALL the misses of the main characters. I know the main characters most of the time survive. But please know that shooting should look like there is a valid reason to miss. These scenes did not!! Their backs were literally bullseyes!!!This movie was just too much of nothing going no where. CGI couldn't help it either. Keanu is still a non memorable actor.Please stop with the sequels until you can actually compete or exceed the previous ones.Die Hard is the only movie that could handle sequels and leave you wanting more.,3

2335,"Somewhat surprised at the rating. I figured the hate crowd would've been happy it's the red pill that's truth. Too subtle maybe. Anyway I didn't know the release date, only saw preview once, so watched it kinda spontaneously. I was a fan of the first one. Second was alright and I fell asleep halfway thru opening night of the third. The sunglasses and coolness got to me.As to this actual movie, I don't see why anyone would dislike it if they enjoyed the others. The whole franchise has had mixed results changing actors. Not securing Hugo Weaving really hurts it I'd say. However the whole Morpheus switch worked okay for me, though they explanation/flashbacks seemed off somehow . Action scenes were alright. Depends who's fighting. It's more varied fighting, less of the 9min Kung fu battles that never looked like they hurt. I'm trying to remember if Neo ever holds a gun in this one.. not that it really matters. Kinda weird he seems to lose flight but grows this sorta force blast thing. NPH is good, new elements make it interesting. Nothing super profound but not trying so hard to be either. It's good. I'd watch it again.",8

2337,"Reviewed December 24, 2021 - 1ST viewing 12/23/21 in IMAXWB - Rated R - Directed by: Lana Wachowski - Based On: Sequel to OriginalThe Matrix (1999) is arguably one of the best films of all time, catapulting into cult classic status almost instantaneously. The Wachowskis wrote and directed a profound script with iconic characters at its core, but the brilliance of it was that it was not simply a post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi venture to free minds, but to postulate (and perhaps prove) that belief is what gets us there. The original film, along with its inevitable two-parter sequels, was at its core an iconic love story, and that connection, along with its ground-breaking bullet-time technology developed for the film and amazing stunts, is why it continues to resonate so deeply all these years later.That being said, you cannot mention the sequels without discussing the proverbial elephant in the room (SPOILER ALERT): the Wachowskis killed Trinity, and presumably Neo in the end.Now admittedly, that decision left fans feeling slighted, and many believed (as did I) that the story was not over. So here we are, eighteen years later, finally getting the answers to the questions we've had for nearly two decades. Few can say why it took so long to return to the story, however it seems the collaboration with the stunt team and a lot of the original actors in the John Wick films along with some personal reasons on the part of the Wachowskis have something to do with it. It saddens me that so many people have completely missed the mark on why this film really is a diamond in a sea of stones... The only possible answer to that is they are not of the original's generation, and/or do not remember the disenchantment that Revolutions left us with.Set in the distant future, Mr. Anderson (Keanu Reeves) finds himself existing between two realities, unsure of which is real. To discover whether or not he lives in the real world or another construct, he must find himself, and find the courage to follow the white rabbit once more. The desire to limit any spoilers is why there is no further description.Lana Wachowski returns to direct what can best be described as her swan song to the original trilogy. It is a rare thing when a writer/filmmaker can reevaluate their original work and not only recognize, but seek to rectify their transgressions. A poetic blend of new and old, Resurrectionsgoes back to the beginning, allowing the narrative to play out as if history is repeating itself, while simultaneously allowing for the possibility of change-the idea that we are in control of our own destiny-a theme straight from the first film. The self-reflection that follows is nothing short of a stroke of brilliance. Harkoning back to Cameron's Terminator films, humanity is once more divided on whether or not the machines can be trusted. Thomas Anderson must once again go on a journey to find himself and have the fortitude to fight for the life he wants instead of settling for the path of least resistance. This theme is vitally important, now more than ever, as we must fight every day to wade through political pandemonium, racial injustice, and a pandemic that has not only taken the lives of loved ones, but created a pervasive level of anxiety for almost every person alive.Wachowski not only seeks balance, but redemption-something we all seem to be looking for. As Mr. Anderson struggles with the sadness, confusion, and anxiety, it is easy to relate to his struggle, as we all have shared it in the last two years. And in his case, without even understanding why, in the absence of his memory. The fact that his experience is reflective of our real-life trauma is brilliant. He begins to feel the spark of a connection again when his colleague Jude (Andrew Lewis Caldwell) formally introduces him to ""Tiffany"", aka Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), at the coffee shop. As the pieces start to fall into place, Neo begins to remember.There are many moments that pay homage to The Matrix (1999), including cut scenes to help Neo (and perhaps audiences) remember the real story. And without spoiling anything, Trinity does have some epic moments that will spark our recollection of why she is a legend, replete with some kick-ass girl power moments.The score, composed by both Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard, was robust and mostly fitting of the scenes, other than a few minor moments. It was surprising that the ethereal song used in the trailer-""White Rabbit"" by Epic Geek, was also featured in the movie. The visual effects were ramped up, however the production would've benefitted from utilizing more practical effects as in the original. Honestly, the only area where the film seems a little lacking is in the stunts/fight sequences, which are generally too few in number, and not as mesmerizing as anything seen in either the original Matrix trilogy or the John Wick films. This could be attributed to the fact that neither Yuen Woo-ping, who choreographed the fight scenes in the Matrix (1999), nor Chad Stahelski, who was a Stunt Coordinator for the latter Matrix films and directed the John Wick films, returned to work on the stunts for this film.The mark that seems to be missed is iconography of Neo and Trinity, perhaps the first and most quintessential power couple of all time. They represent the love and hope that we all desperately seek, a connection so strong and rare, it can only be equated to soul mates, and their journey represents the lengths one must go to find and hold onto a love that rare. It does not come easily, but nothing worth fighting for ever does. And then there's the power of choice and belief. I do not say this often, however this film struck a personal chord with me. It has been a long time since a movie has so excited and inspired me, not only re-instilling hope, but giving me back a piece of something seemingly lost long ago, as if something clicked back into place. There are other films whose narrative revisions or resolutions had the same profound effect-namely X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017). I was so scarred by the events of X3, I wasn't sure I would ever watch another X-Men movie again. And presently, Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) is in effect working on a similar resolution, but you'll just have to go see it if you want to know what it is!In my humble opinion, if you found yourself annoyed with or disappointed in this film, you are not a true fan of the original, and/or do not fully understand the depth and connection that make Neo and Trinity so iconic. The Matrix (1999) was never just about the effects or the fight sequences, but about the power of love-they are the heart of it all.FINAL VERDICT: You can go home again... Let's just say Wachowski gave me hope again-no small thing. I definitely recommend seeing it in theaters-in IMAX-for the best experience possible. Not only that, but before you go watch it in IMAX, WATCH THE ORIGINALS! Whether you have already seen them or not, it is necessary to remember the context and conclusion so that you may experience the full weight of this story. This movie gave me something back I thought I lost all those years ago, so please... Go in with an open mind and FREE IT!8.5 (9) - Rewatch Value: 9~AleXa~ An original IMDB user for over twenty years.",9
2338,"The Only Question I have after watching this film is ""Did Lana Wachowski pull off the most expensive troll of all time ??!!"" How else would you describe that a sequel of a legendary film trilogy, from start to finish, made meta jokes about its own legacy, ridiculed the recent Hollywood trend of mindless, uninspired franchise movies and then made one of the worst Nostalgia-bait Cashgrabs just like those !!! Almost everything in this film disappoints. Had some cool ideas maybe but horrible execution. The Original Matrix had pathbreaking Action &amp; philosophical discussions. This one had neither. Thank God My Money wasn't wasted on this.",5
2339,"This movie is quite nearly incoherent. But that's not the worst component of this ill advised sequel. The choices that are made throughout are sloppy at best, clunky and pretentious at worst. The only thing that is really interesting in this whole mess of a movie is that Lana Wachowski wants to remind us of how great the original Matrix movies were, through the most clunky and grasping flashback devices I've ever seen, and yet he completely undercuts the thematic core of what made the first Matrix movie such a compelling story. That's interesting because it's such an immense and obvious miscalculation. What would make an artist think that would work? Someone who is no longer interested in making art, but who is interested in utilizing some of the tricks that made the other story successful and directing those tricks towards propping up an ideological thesis. By the end of this movie Wachowski stops trying to be clever, and just says out loud (or explicitly acts it out right in front of us) what he's trying to force the audience to buy into. It's a perfect example of how you can't take a great story and switch the elements around to fit an opposing ideology and expect that story to work. It's really sad to see a movie that showed everyone you can combine deep philosophical ideas with amazing, energetic action, devolve into something this dumb.",1
2340,"Given the usual online negativity that I have to wade through in order to get a politically unbiased critique of whether a movie is worth seeing in a theatre or not, I bought my ticket with a slight amount of trepidation as to what the quality of this sequel to one of my favourite films would be. Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised to find the best Matrix movie since the original.All the performances were top notch and the story was full of interesting twists, turns, and typical Matrix existential questions and ideas. Keanu's acting chops have definitely improved over the years as he lights up the screen playing another empathic hero; Carrie-Anne Moss slips easily and brilliantly back into her role as Trinity; Jessica Henwick surprised me as a legitimate and compelling screen presence; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II energises the screen just as his predecessor did playing Morpheus; Jonathan Groff as Agent Smith gives a fun and well-nuanced performance; as does Neil Patrick Harris as the Analyst.The visual style is slightly askew from the original trilogy, but remained recognisable as part of the Matrix brand.For me it was a thoroughly compelling addition to the Matrix saga and I'd be happy to see another trilogy spawn from this film.",9
2341,"When I heard that they were making a 4th Matrix movie, I was baffled. The Matrix Revolution (2003) ended fine even if the movie itself was a mixed bag. The only thing that gave me hope was that one of the directors from the original Matrix trilogy was returning. The premise is ""To find out if his reality is a physical or mental construct, Mr. Anderson, aka Neo, will have to choose to follow the white rabbit once more. If he's learned anything, it's that choice, while an illusion, is still the only way out of -- or into -- the Matrix. Neo already knows what he has to do, but what he doesn't yet know is that the Matrix is stronger, more secure and far more dangerous than ever before"". So should it have been resurrected or stay shut down?One of the things I liked in this movie was the ideas that were explored. In the first act of the movie, it's revealed that Thomas (Keanu Reeves) created a very popular trilogy of games; The Matrix Trilogy. It then becomes incredibly meta and self-aware which was oddly enjoyable. The film also explores some things that have changed since The Matrix Revolution (2003). A lot of these were very interesting and I am glad that it didn't feel like nothing came of Neo and Trinity's sacrifice. The world of the Matrix has changed and the ""real life"" world has also changed. The changes for both were no doubt very compelling to watch.Keanu and Carrie return as Neo and Trinity respectively. It was great to see them both and I find the chemistry between the two to still be there. Out of the new characters, I love Jessica Henwick who plays Bugs. She is the cool rebellious character who would break the rules for the right thing. I also think Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who plays the new Morpheus is also great in the role. He does a good job of giving off a similar vibe to that of Laurence Fishburne, the original Morpheus.However, this new Morpheus feels so inconsequential to the story that I wondered why they even bothered having Morpheus in the film. Likewise, Jonathan Groff plays the new Smith and I just don't understand why. Like the new Morpheus, the new Smith is also very inconsequential to the story and just feels like he is just kind of there for nostalgia bait. Unlike Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jonathan does not feel like Hugo Weaving, the original Smith. So it is very jarring when he is on screen and is spouting lines like he is supposed to be Smith when it does not feel like it whatsoever. Both of these two could've just been entirely new characters. It also annoys me that the director didn't just bring back both Laurence and Hugo if they were planning on bringing both their characters back. Laurence and Hugo, to me, are both also important people to the Matrix franchise.The story didn't work well for me either. The first act is being self-aware about how studios love milking franchises and not doing anything bold with it. Yet this film does the exact thing it is trying to criticize. After the first act, it becomes a very generic story about saving the girl and stopping the bad guy which is disappointing. The first act also retreads a lot of the same beat for beat stuff that was in the first Matrix film. The main character notices things are off, he then meets a person who convinces him the world is fake, the mirror sequence, the red pill and blue pill stuff, the learning Kung Fu sequence. It is also felt odd having to hear the characters explain the concept of the Matrix again even though this is the 4th entry and most people watching this would already know that. The movie also has way too much exposition and people explaining things. There are moments where I felt like I was being bombarded with way too much information. Sometimes it feels like it would be better to show and not tell but this film does a lot of telling.Another aspect that made the Matrix trilogy stand out was the iconic action sequences. However, they are incredibly boring in this film. The hand-to-hand fight scenes are overly edited with quick cuts that made it irritating to watch. There are no cool long shots like in the original Matrix trilogy. The choreography is just not that great and it feels weak. What makes it worse is that a lot of the action scenes just has Neo use some kind of force push power which screams lazy. The visuals and music score are fine but they do lack impact and are not memorable either. The film also includes a lot of flashbacks and footage from the older Matrix movies and I find it a little annoying. It feels like they were trying to beat it into the audiences head ""remember this!"".In the end, I came out of this thinking that they shouldn't have made the 4th film. It did not feel like a story that was worth telling. This film is just pandering towards peoples nostalgia and it does not do a good job at it either. I don't know if this is a start of a new Matrix trilogy but if it is, I am not very optimistic about this new direction.",4
2342,"I'm easily bored by Marvel type films so it's refreshing to see a good sci-fi film. I enjoyed the first Matrix films but less keen on the second two - the story was too complicated and tied itself in knots.I was expecting something pretty poor for no 4 but it was good. A story I could understand, characters I was interested in and rooting for. A few subtle jokes and no deadpool/marvel style nonsense.Recommend a watch.",8
2343,"Any of us doing something after 18 years would start with a small test, just to ""test the waters"".Most people that disliked the 4th movie most likely didn't understood the depths of the previous three.Not to mention that ALL THE CANON content in the video games, comic books and the animatrix together with the previous 3 movies would have helped anyone paint a better picture of how the next trilogy could play out.TOO MANY SHEEPLE OUT THERE AND IN HERE!People of 2021 don't deserve The Matrix.",10
2344,"The Matrix Resurrections was an unneeded addition to the legendary Matrix series. Many people agreed that the third installment of the series was not up to par with the standards set in place by the first two, yet the fourth one is even more underwhelming.To begin, the film put messages out in a very direct manner such as ""face zuck"" which tied the film to extremely recent events and thus made it lose its novelty. It did not allowing the viewer to comprehend any hidden meanings as they are so blatantly portrayed. Apart from that, these messages do not tie in with the plot progression and they seem so out of place. The antithesis between this film which tries to become a critic of political happenings and the originals which immersed themselves deeply into the story is shocking.Despite one's assumption that graphics and film editing should have become even more advanced, the colors were not even close to the original which had underlying greens and blues that gave the scene a deeper element. Additionally, the effects that made the originals so popular (namely the slow motion movements) seemed worse in this film than in those released decades ago.I feel as though the Wachowskis should work on a new series instead of changing the legacy of The Matrix by bringing it into the 2020s.Additionally, having new actors for established characters (like Morpheus and Agent Smith) lost the flair of the original (though I know certain actors like Hugo Weaving were not available).The implementation of a video game inside The Matrix to explain the history of Neo and Trinity was an odd approach which I personally didn't appreciate. I understand what it was meant to do (explain the memories they may have and keep them close to the matrix by having Neo work on the video game), yet I feel as though it loses the ingenuity of the original films that did not rely on external or cultural elements to explain their respective plots. Additionally, I think it binds The Matrix storyline to the late 20th and early 21st century which I personally find a little disappointing as The Matrix was originally made in a way that was ambiguous, so as to apply to many different decades.Next, I feel as though Lana Wachowski decided to take a superhero approach to the ending. I found myself cringing when Trinity and Neo fly off during the last seen, I don't know who thought it was a good idea. It really saddens me to see a monumental series turn into a superhero movie that has lost touch with its roots.",6
2345,This movie was boring and cringy. Why even bother. Don't waste 2hours watching this. Not worth it! Was excited to see them bring it back to be disappointed.,1
2346,"Nothing new to see here , move along.A complete rehash of the best moments from the Matrix.Someone thought this was a good idea , probably a big salary for Neo and Trinity...so why not.Only for the Devout Fan ..",5
2347,"The effects were great and it was wonderful to see Neo and Trinity back again - and I'm not really sure why it's attracting so much hate - maybe some fanboys shouldn't focus on whether to take the red or blue pill, and just take a chill pill. Guys - it's a movie. And as a movie, it's pretty solid. I came out of the theatre on a high - it was FUN and reaffirmed my faith in humanity. And that's what I think Matrix films are about!",8
2348,"This is not the kind of Matrix you want to watch if you're a fan of the original trilogy. It literally lost all of it's charm, ambiance and good action the previous ones had. Me and my brother who grew up watching this as a kid and found this so good and entertaining left after 30 minutes or so. Everything feels so freaking rushed, mashed together you aren't even involved for like a second. Also no special effects have to be involved at any time if it's not even to make something new or refreshing... They literally took over the script line by line at various moments. This is so bad and painful to watch.",1
2349,"We got the point of The Matrix at the end of the first film, which then after 4 years got added to unecessarily to make a trilogy and a lot more money for the makers. Waiting another 17 years to revamp a perfectly good, left on its own, trilogy, smacks of the same need/greed.I wish I hadn't bothered seeing this new episode, but was amused by 'The Analyst's' infererences at the end of the film, to the NWO's build back better idea that ""The sheeple aren't going anywhere. They like my world. They don't want this ... sentimentality. They don't want freedom or empowerment; they want to be controlled. They crave the comfort of certainty and that means you two, back in your pods, alone, just like them.""Nice try, but some of us are a little more awake than that, but it does make me wonder who really financed this drivel and at a crucial point in the global 'pandemic'!",
2350,"This movie is a parody. If you're expecting a serious film that continues the plot of the original films in any serious way then you will be greatly disappointed.The issue is not that parodies can't work but that this film just doesn't work for a variety of reasons. The primary reason being that it makes no logical sense for the director of one of the best action films of all time to make a parody of the original masterpiece under the guise that the film is serious. However creative it is, it's a disappointment, waste of time, and ultimately leaves you wondering who thought making this was a good idea...",1
2351,"I don't think so It is compatible with Matrix philosophy. Weak Morpheus, too overpower Trinity, main hero doesn't complete to this show. It could be better when it cant be directed and done.",6
2352,"Leaving the theater, after watching Matrix Resurrections made me moan for the lost time (especially the extra 10 minutes for this ridiculous post credit scene).The movie lacked originality ... completely. Matrix Resurrections is nothing more than a stuck of scenes, where the director tries (but fails miserably) to copy techiches and even complete scenes from the Old Matrix, Marvel films (in-jokes) and Nolan's films (epic music action scenes).The story is also as bad as it gets, not only full of holes (like the other 2 sequels) but also without any surprise or intrest.Avoid at all cost.",4
2353,"The Matrix Resurrections is a movie that starts like a nice code which attracts first us into its world but begins to get glitches and bugs in later compilation. The characters as well as the plot in the film catches our attention many times but it gets nose-dives a lot of times as it progresses from first act to the last. Story and the presentation around it stands like a good enough combo at one point yet it loses its grip once the elements start to hit us one by one. ActorsStarting from our main attractions, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss to Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Jessica Henwick along with all the other actors tries to put a whole lot of soul behind their acts but it doesn't stand out that much in this vast matrix. Action and the choreography behind is one of those elements that excites us in some parts but gets a little lousy in most parts as we continue watching it. Overall this forth compilation of the Matrix franchise feels like a nostalgic pool that the audience would wanna dive in, not to watch this movie as an individual one but to feel that sheer nostalgia from their past. In terms of watching it depends on the audience but mostly the pointer stays heavy on one time watch.",6
2354,"I disagree with the rest of the reviews and I'm glad they made the movie. Maybe they don't realize that the Matrix rebooted in the end of the trilogy, so this one is a little different. The style of the movie has also changed a little.There's new, more modern fashion style which was nice.I liked the part in the development studio with the almost 4th wall kinda jokes.Also loved the part where Trinity has to choose if she wants to stay with her family or leave with Neo.Music was good, action was good, and Keanu and Carrie were amazing.I think people are overdoing with the reviews. I get it that some may have been disappointed but giving the movie a rating below 4 is over exaggerating.Also it's true that there were a few parts that were a little cheesy/cringy.Also the first part of the movie with Bugs before Neo shows up, was a little weird.Overall I loved the movie and was satisfied with the ending.",10
2355,"The other Wachowski was right, there was no need to go back. The stunt choreography doesn't really work because you can see that Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss are a lot less limber than they used to be (all of us get old, it's a sad fact of life). Bringing Morpheus back the way they did seems pointless. They could have just given the character another name because it didn't feel like Morpheus at all. Smith didn't feel like Smith either. I'm sure Jonathan Groff tried his best but he is not nearly as intimidating as Hugo weaving was! The Oracle is able to be purged as easily other programs? They also never say how the Analysis ""took over"" from the Architect etc. It just feels like a hollow cash-grab.",5
2356,I am a fan of the Trilogy. I at times binge watch the Trilogy especially during the Holidays. I have to do it now because I have to somehow undo what I saw with Resurrections. Horrible! The fight scenes were very bad.The constant reflections of the previous three just seemed to be put there because they were not clever enough to continue this story . I wish this resurrection never happened.,1
2357,"I asked myself that like 80% it was hardcore confusing there for a minute. Look in a world of reboots, remakes and lack of originality, Matrix took a page from the self-aware and decided to make a fun, satire, crazy sequel literally no one asked for. Its just big dumb fun, and escape from the reality, you know like how movies are supposed to be.Still alot of Dragonball Z fiht scenes though.",7
2358,"When I saw the reviews on here I was scared to watch this next Matrix movie. I was a big fan of the three other movies, rated them with a nine, eight and another nine stars, so you could say that I was thrilled when I heard there would be another one. Once again I think people are exaggerating with their one, two and three stars ratings. It's certainly not that bad, but I agree that it could have been much better. The story is difficult to follow, makes no sense sometimes, but the other three movies were not easy to follow either. All in all this one is a disappointment. I expected something much better, certainly when you know what they're capable to do now, twenty years later, when the technology took another big leap. The cast should have been the same as the previous ones, so that was also not the greatest move. The ones that were present in this one are not bad playing their characters but they for sure lack the style they had in the previous movies. The fight scenes were also not that impressive. The good thing was that there is still that Gigeresque scenery which made all the movies look brilliant. The Matrix Resurrections is for sure the weakest of all four, I would probably have rated with a six instead of a seven if I wasn't such a big fan of the previous ones.",7
2359,"As a HUGE fan of the Matrix. This is the worst and weirdest disappointment. I was open to something new and fresh. But.. This wasn't it. 1. It felt spoofed. Like the movies before this were all a joke or game. 2. Zombie movie but rated pg. 3. Who's the ""one"" again? This movie was bad. I hope this was supposed to lead up to something better but if they never make another, I won't complain.",4
2360,"I was so sad, because this was gonna be the sequel that would break the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movie. Everything was perfectly set up for just that. But what wenr wrong?1. Actors - The actors in the movie were ok. Not bad at all, but they were ok. Majority of the cast were ""tv-actors"". They should've invested more in the actors.2. Script-screenplay - Hear me out. The script was good. I can see what they were going for, I get it! The idea was good! Could've been successfull if only the screenplay was well written. Neo was constantly confused and seemed to have no idea of what was going on. They've should've skipped the comedy in the beginning.3. Actionscenes - some scenes were cool. Definetly. But what happened to the fighting choreography? What happened? It was really bad. It felt like a really bad version of something bad. And the scenes were badly edited also. Sadly. The shooting scenes were easly made, the action scenes missed the fantastic work from the first and second movie. The lagging slowmotion also worsened the quality. I mean, its 2021, who uses that type of slowmow nowadays?4. Camerawork - it was missing alot of good camework that the first 2 matrix movies had. The special angles, the nice dark imagefilter. It was missing alot.5. Locations - it was as if the movie had rented 3 places to film on. The street at the end, and 2 different greenscreen studios. What happened there? Matrix should have alot of locations! Maybe it was the budget? I miss info about that.6. The movie as a whole, I gave it a 4, because it missed intensity, its uniqness, good dialogues, and good storytelling. It atarted well, but went sownwards after that. To much focus om Love and not to ""what is happening"". Nice new updates, nice shots from the old movies. Nice connections between the movies and so on, but in the end, it couldnt cope with how big The Matrix is. And thats so sad. I hope for a sequel, because I believe the Wachowski sisters are geniuses! If someone can turn this around, its them!",4
2361,"Matrix four Resurrections far far exceeded all my expectations!Since 1999 I have watched the first three Matrix movies well over 100 times, with that said,I tip my hat to every single person that made this production come to fruition. 🎩",10

2363,I quite enjoyed this movie. Keanu and Carrie-Anne both acted their ass off in this movie and the supporting cast was great too especially Jessica and Yahya. This movie is a masterpiece in my eyes and it plays with your head a lot and I love the breaking of the fourth wall in a few scenes. I am gonna watch it again soon.,10
2364,"While this movie tries to do interesting things...while simultaneously rehashing old Matrix cliches, it manages to be...rather dull...and incredibly uninteresting. Nothing stands out as smart. Or cool. Or edgy. Or thought provoking. Which are all Matrix hallmarks. Apparently nothing was learned from the last Star Wars trilogy disaster as this movie suffers from similar thinking of rehashing the past. On top of the story issues everything else from the top to the bottom feels lazy. Directing, acting, dialog, effects, action....just everything. It almost feels like an expensive fan made production. And sadly, at the end, you don't care about a thing....or a sequel.",4
2365,"I had *extremely low* expectation for this film so I thought i might be prepared but here I am.. I don't remember another time getting THIS angry with a Hollywood production, maybe Ghost in the Shell or Death Note.But this, this is an absolute crime.The 'Matrix' MEANT something. Like Ghost in the Shell (the anime), the original film brought something that people had never experienced before. It was the 1st of its kind. But most importantly it was philosophical and had strong messages.And what is this ""Resurrection"" exactly? To call it a parody would be too kind, a farce morelike, for Lana Wachowski is ruining the legacy of one of the most iconic scifi movies of a generation.Advice for future Matrix production: please give us something different, a new story, new characters, most importantly new philosophical messages that perhaps resides in the same Universe.",1
2366,"I'll keep it short, I'm sure at least out of curiosity everyone will be watching this movie, regardless the reviews.I just thought the story was quite unimaginative, there's a part in the middle that I'd enjoy the most, when they explain what happened after the previous movie. I thought it was a good twist, but all that was just gone to waste, not much more happened with all that, and the third act of the movie was bland and mediocre.I was expecting better visuals too, watching today the previous movies (specially the second and third, which are quite heavy in CGI), you can tell the tech wasn't at the peek of it's capabilities, so 20 years after I was expecting some mind blowing scenes, not only on its technical aspect but from Watchowsky's creative mind, but everything seemed recycled, not only literally, with the flashbacks to the old movies, but re-done and overused, like bullet time, agent's dodge, helicopter hitting buildings and (overused to exhaustion) Neo's power on the last half hour, what a bore to watch, that was lazy writing!!There were no interesting new characters, Bugs is kind of nice somehow in terms of personality (even though I couldn't understand half of what she was saying), but it's not developed at all, and then it's just a bunch of background, unknown guys that don't do anything but running around throwing punches or shooting, really boring.Morpheus' casting change was completely unnecessary and unexplained (did I miss something here?), I pretty much think that director thought he didn't age well enough and would be good to get someone ""cooler"". Wrong, in my opinion. He did look somehow like a younger version of Fishburne, but there was no reason to do that, and I didn't feel Abdul-Mateen II was playing the same character, sure it's more the writing of his character to blame than himself.But worst than Morpheus, and way more important was the poor casting choice of the VERY BLAND Jonathan Groff as Smith!! What a miss!! Seriously, how could the director think this interpretation was anything even close to Hugo Weaving's, I'm shocked.This was one of the biggest problems of the movie.The main villain had potential, but fell short with a very lousy defeat.The exiles were absolutely lame, what a lack of imagination, I'm honestly ashamed of their design, at this point the absence of creativity was feeling quite heavy.The ending was very bland, again result of the overall lack if imagination made everything feel rushed and mediocre, with a lousy chasing scene at the end (only the bots actions were interesting, but that's one minute out of half an hour) and the final scene was cheesy at the best.I enjoyed seeing Neo and Trinity again, and I didn't mind the come back of the franchise, if it was a milking the cow situation, it could have been done much better. This was definitely out of monetization, there was no new ideas to make a movie, it's quite obvious and a shame.Still, even if it's definitely the worst of the series (including Animatrix) it's a fair watch.",6
2367,"The original Matrix was a pathbreaking movie back in 1999. It brought a breath of fresh air in all the departments of film making.The Story, Screenplay, Cinematography, VFX, Music, Costumes, all were a never seen before experience.The background score of the original Matrix played an important role in making the movie thrilling and engaging. But in this movie the music was bland and boring.Ressurections is just like a 'Matrix Retold' version.It just spoiled the experience that the Matrix trilogy created and I'd prefer the name Matrix Crucifixon rather than Matrix Ressurections.",4
2368,"Ultimately this film was ok, it wasn't great. I think in all fairness the fact that The Matrix was back was all hype and no substance.My main complaint is nothing really made it 'The Matrix' the fight scenes were generic, the cinematography was meh, the new characters forgettable.This was a film that back in the day invented a lot of firsts for the cinema industry, primary with the camera work involve, so to see the new with none of that incorporated seems like a missed opportunity.You can enjoy this film going in blind but as a Matrix fan I wanted bullet time, jumping off walls, camera tricks and more. Did they need to make this movie? Probably not, but they really wasted the opportunity with a fizzle instead of a bang.",5
2369,"This film is redundant.It has nothing to say.It looks like Matrix, but isn't Matrix.I like Keanu, but what this film make me realise. It wasn't because of Keanu Matrix was great. Not in the slightest. And I hate it.That being said, the first part of the movie was entertaining. It looked like something great was going to happen. It didn't.Only disappointment happened.",6
2370,"I am super Matrix trilogy fan and consider it to be one of the greatest movies ever made . That been said when it comes to the new matrix movie , the cinematography and cast selection didn't feel right ,when the 1999 matrix movie had better cinematography and it was made 22 years ago. The cast selection and their presentation felt like a downgrade comparted to the previous matrix movies, especially Neo since he is main character and the beard and long hair didn't represent the neo we knew. The fight scenes looked pretty amateur level and wasn't expecting the movie to be this bad.",5
2371,"When will people listen to the great David Ehrlich? (IndieWire film critic) He calls Matrix Resurrections a ""rare blockbuster that dares to ask what else might be on the menu."" and he's right! Lana Wachowski is set to become the next Spielberg, I'm not kidding! David Ehrlich is the one sane man in a world gone mad. He is the only voice of reason, like Moses before him, he will lead us to the cinematic promised land. Why don't people believe him? Why is he labeled a fool? He is trying to tell us about great movies people! He should be thanked! Yes I went to see the movie with my 5 year old cousin and yes it IS as great as everyone is saying. Those meta messages were really DEEP! Lana Wachowski will go on to one of the most best film careers ever! Hollywood in my eyes has never made a bad movie, they are incapable of making a bad movie. They are so smart. People think they want a story and character development and emotion and stuff, but that's BORING! All we want is relentless fast cuts and generic tunes with exposition and Hollywood did it again. Bravo! I can't wait to see it again. Thank you David Ehrlich, your glowing review got me to see Matrix Resurrections and you saved me, and gave me a great gift! And the effects? Genius! They have OSCAR written all over it for best special effects! Look out Denis Villeneueve, Lana Wachowski has arrived! Bravo David Ehrlich!",1
2372,"Couldnt asked for a better time for this to come out, so much in this points to the problems we live with every day but happily go along with.Not the best matrix but definitely worth watching, action could be better, feels like they didn't have the same team on the fights and fox as previous movies.",10
2373,If you like woke leftist trash then this one is for you. Typical that someone has to go ruin a legacy and a legendary movie franchise. Mega violence in the movie but let's be sure to capture gender equality. What a joke.,1
2374,Please don't waste your time. Take it from me. You're better off watching TikTok videos and watching paint dry.This movie isn't it no!Thanks.Please don't do it to yourself . Do something else if you have 2 hours and 30 minutes to spare.,3
2375,"Alright so the action was Amazing also the CGI was insaneThe customs Are very good,the events were kinda slow and very fast in a weird waymusic flashbacks were Extremely Good,i wish they bring all the old cast likeThe real Agent smith and Morpheus.Btw watch this movie in home don't waste your money.Just don't expect a lot from this movie think of it as an Extra Matrix Movie.Overall:Great Action Bad Story,i like it7.4/10Enjoy everybody :)",7
2376,This is what you get when you try to milk a franchise out to its last dollar. No creativity. No choreography.Convoluted story and absolutely bland characters.The matrix was awesome and ended in 1999.,3

2378,"If you have seen the 1st movie, this is will feel like a copy an paste but edited by teens who think they are awesome, but are actually morons.First 5 MINUTES. I could not watch any further. They over-dramatized the scenes. The Agents have become worse shots than Storm Troopers.This movie feels like a rushed parody that is trying to act serious, when all they are doing is making the audience puke in disgust.I hate the Sequel Trilogy to Star Wars. But the Matrix 4 makes those movies feel competent and better.Cringe has a new successor: The Matrix 4.This movie made me suicidal. Thanks.I have only one question for the idiots who made this garbage: ""WTF WERE YOU SMOKING?""",1
2379,"...to know this needless 4th installment that no true Matrix fans asked for deserved a 0/10 rating. In fact, we didn't even asked for the 2nd or 3rd, let alone the 4th sequel.",1
2380,"*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*Matrix review - 10/10Matrix Reloaded review - 8/10Matrix Revolutions review - 8/10So obviously the bar is set high on a Matrix sequel after such a long hiatus. I tried to keep an open mind and low expectations. But this is a movie that feels so disconnected from the original trilogy, the biggest shock is that the Wachowski's were behind it. It feels like the Matrix name was handed over to a new group of writers/producers/directors who completely trashed the creators' original vision.First... the movie is filled with either copycat remake scenes of old scenes or flat out clips from the old movies. It's the same feeling of watching the Hangover sequels and feeling like it's rehashed the old script with new scenery. Or like going to see a band in concert that is lazily playing old hits from 30 years ago. And the story that fills in between is void of anything interesting or original.Second... what there is of new story is so bland and lacking, I almost shut the movie off at about the halfway point (I never do that). The first 20-30 minutes are actually cringy and lack the grit that we saw from the first Matrix. The villains are corny and don't carry anywhere near the weight of Smith from the original. The acting is terrible and even Keanu and Carrie-Ann are so bland they feel like they mailed this one in. It doesn't feel like Neo and Trinity, the characters, at all. But overall, there is no build up and, quite frankly, no ending. The whole thing feels like it's forcing itself to fill time and lead up to a climactic, action packed payoff. However, the climax isn't built up from anything and the payoff is so short it feels like the movie just abruptly ends. Like riding the scenic choo choo across Six Flags and trying to convince someone it's a roller coaster.Lastly... let's talk about the VFX. After all, this was a big item that put this franchise on the map. Aside from some minor and unoriginal additions, it's mostly the same old tricks. At this point, we have been there and done that. It feels as if they are going for some sort of nostalgia, wanting us to see those ""greatest hits"" played out again on screen.In the end, I wouldn't say it's a money grab. Feels more like a swing and a miss at nostalgia and that the Wachowski's had enough of an ego to throw a half baked story together, thinking we could forgive that once we get to see iconic characters on screen again. Even in the final scene, it's as if they are patting themselves on the back for a job well done... when it was anything but.",2
2381,"I've read quite a few reviews about this film and I've also watched the film. Honestly, reviews are way funnier than film itself. Sorry, Wachowskis, but key actors are missing and plot is missing! Matrix isn't the same without Hugo Weaving, Laurence Fishburne and the mother of the Matrix. ;)If Wachowskis want to treat their depression, that's fine but please don't take a d*mp on the Matrix. I sort of liked Matrix 2 and Matrix 3, so imagine how bad 4 should be to make me write this comment and I only give it 5/10 out of respect for the Matrix. Otherwise, it's closer to 3 or 4.",4
2382,"I have never in my life walked out of a cinema, except after watching this film. This happened less than an hour ago and I am writing this review because I am still in shock. This is by far the worst film I have watched in a cinema, made all the more terrible by the fact that this is a Matrix film.I left after an hour and half into the film, and I still could not tell you what the plot was about. Almost every conversation seems like its purpose in the film is only for exposition. Some dialogue is outright cringeworthy.",1
2383,"I just want to know, Why!? Can't believe I paid money to watch this, should have known better.How did keanu Reeves even agree to do this mind numbing film? Someone should slap 👋 him for this terrible sequel.Don't get me started on the script and cheesy lines!",2
2384,"I had high expectations, but the whole movie was a total hoax. The story is lazy and doesn't bring anything new to the audience; in the end, you feelt that it was a remake/meshup of the first three movies.The fight scenes and the pursuit of the new ""Time Bullet"" effect was ridiculous, and the attack of the bots (zombies) was just silly because there was not a real threat for any of the characters.Some good VFX is all Lana brings us in this movie, but for a ""Resurrection"" that's not enough.",3
2385,"I love the matrix but this was just very poor. I will semi interested for the first 3 quarters of the movie, at that point I'd have given it a 6But the ending was so cheesy and betrayed what made the matrix awesome in the first place... neo!",3

2389,"There's no cyberpunk goth edge like the previous movies had, no appeal of peeling back the skin of a false world to a hidden world beneath.For me the glowing gem was NPH. The other actors did splendid work, the writing just seemed lazy in my opinion. Too much of a rush without proper foundation.",4
2390,"The movie is good and have some good special effects. But what pissed me off its the way that they use some scenes of the other movies. I was so bored of it. They used them so much and i found they just use the nostalgia part and found it very boring. Even if the movie have some good idea, the movie cant find in my opinion his own identity and it s way too much inspired by the others. I found the actors really good and offer some good performance but thats it. Im not really fan of the movie and it forget the main quality of the first movie: the philosophy part. With this movie, its just have some good special effects and some good actions scenes. Its still a pleasure to see Neo and Trinity. Good but nothing more.",6
2391,"Firstly, let me say that The Matrix is the one movie in my life that I always think about, it defined an era and it is 100% the best movie I have ever seen. I agree that the following sequels were not as good, they rarely are, but I still enjoyed them and found them fitting for the franchise.Since Revolutions, I have lost count how many times I Googled about a Matrix 4, there were rumours for years all of which were fake. When I eventually found out about Resurrections, I almost burst with excitement. The thought of this movie franchise returning after almost 20 years blew my mind.Fast forward to the release date and walking out of the cinema, I cannot express how disappointed I felt. The movie felt long winded and boring with too much talking. There was nothing like the action or fight scenes that featured in the first 3 movies and the scenes that did involve action and fighting were over far too quickly with no real emphasis on Neo and his skills. All he seemed to do was hold both his arms out and stop bullets in most of the scenes.I have since watched the movie again at home and did find the second watch far better but still, the disappointment is still there and it just leaves you with the feeling, why!? What is the point of this movie? It certainly wasn't the come back i'm sure most Matrix fans were expecting.Maybe Lana needs to have a chat with the writer of the John Wick franchise to remind herself what an action movie is. This felt more like a love story with too much filler, the same as Sense8 season 2 turned out to be.",3
2392,"This fourth movie maybe the best in the series. It's amazing how they succeeded in bringing back the same sentiment, the same atmosphere and so many of the same people after so many years. Neo and Trinity are amongst the best movie couples ever. They story has elevated in this movie and the action is, as always, the best of the best.",10
2393,"This was matrix, then... A legendary movie series, with its timeless plot, legendary visuals, even the score and every scene was perfectly synchronized, the mind bending and professionaly displayed script, every scene was like a lesson for actors, audience and producers.Then there is this, resurrections... In fact, what the f.... is this? Do all producers made an arrangement to produce movies, even an amateur with a good camera can pull out? Same goes with resident evil... I am reallly sorry, I literally waited for 20 years to have another Matrix movie and I really want to sue Wachowski for deliveirng such a disaster. Did you forget how to produce a movie? Huh, Lana?Did a kindergarden child write the plot? I really can not believe there exists a plot, every major event is only told. The purge, why machines fought with themselves, why did they ressurected? The control system, the mistery of the system in the orginal trilogy was given so perfect that this new one really make no sense!!Agent smith, portrayed by a younger man!! Why? Why is he still there? Why did you put morpheus? Why was he needed? Bullet time expanded on the whole movie? There are jaw dropping mediocre fighting seqeunces which can be found in a low budget B class movie. HEEY!! Whereever I try to hold, it literally falls apart... Come on!! This is matrix!! What do you think you are doing? Where is that legendary action scenes? Camera angles? Where is that matrix? Please return to previous version...",2
2394,They themselves are too plugged in to the matrix to understand how INCREDIBLE this movie is. The symbolism is unbelievable. It's THE anti-capalist movie. Something most of us have been living with the pandemic. Wow! I have no words. Frome the costumes to the dialogue to the story line. Bravissimo Wachowski! I didn't think a matrix 4 was a good idea but he proved me SO wrong.,10
2395,"People here are just too serious. It's movie, not a opera. Classic reboot. Just enjoy. And be grateful that they decide to do something like this after almost 20 years. I'm Matrix fan since 1999, and I don't care about ""story"" or ""directing"". It's Matrix. That's enough for me.",8
2396,"After watching this I have no idea why they made it. Poor, same storyline just reversed for 2 characters, casting shocking.Special effects and soundtrack as you would expect are superb.This reboot wasn't needed. Unfortunately I'm assuming there will be more further sequels.",4
2397,"This movie tells us that Neo and Trinity were revived from the dead and now they try to figure out who they really are.They keep having flashbacks of their prime times when fighting the war and are now chased by the machines and try to stop them from getting back together.On paper this sounds pretty good but the execution is really blend.It's really boring and the movie is basically a cash grab and every character is blend........except Smith which I really like how they played with his character in a way that makes scenes with him a whole lot more fun.Other than that the movie is pretty blend, it has some fun scenes, but compared to the other Matrix movies, Even Revolutions it's the worst one yet.4/10 story is interesting, execution is horrible.",4
2398,Very poorly written. They should have kept Neo and the series in its pod. Horrible. Had 100 new characters show up and no clue why. I still didnt know what happened? What was accomplished? No agent smith and a fake Morpheus.,2

So my question is, how do you make this movie 20 year later and have (1) worse special effects, (2) worse fight choreography, and (3) worst action set pieces .... Blade Runner 2049 and Dune are the example of how to do a sequel (even better than the first one in my opinion)",3

They screwed up big here. I can't even put it into words. If all of the crazy wasters of this generation (You know, the real crazy ones who want things for free and burn down cities) joined forces and put their ideas together to make a film based on The Matrix, this would be it. Surprised Keanu even agreed to be in it. Do bad.",3
2403,Best part of the movie are the recaps within the movie of the previous movies. Real gem.Genre better described as romcom with aard.Not recommended unless you hate yourself or the friend you invited over.,1
2404,Wow! Matrix Resurrections should have been called Matrix Tokyo Drift. The only good thing about this movie was that half the cast was from Sense8. You know that feeling when they make a sequel without any of the original actors? This has some of the original actors and still felt like that.,1
2405,"It's a very well made film. Excellent writing, good conflicts, great acting ect ect. So if this were any other film, I think it would be pretty great.But then we come to the point of: whats the point of this movie. Sure I think the self reflection was executed very well. Kind of in a meta commentary of what the original trilogy stood for, and how to go about and making a continuation of that story.But the question of 'why are we doing this' isn't really awnsered. In the film it's quickly brushed off as 'corporate dicission'. And maybe that is an acurate reflection of the real world. But that, in term, only makes it more sad. That this movie is ultimately hollow in it's core, and the people who made this movie know this.So it became clear that the main reason for this film existing is money. Not because people wanted it, or the writers wanted to expand their story.So all in all, I think the people working on this film did an excellent job. But this movie was bound to fail just because it's motivation and drive is hollow to the core.So what you are left with is a well made film, that doesn't do anything. And nothing additional was gained beyond the things given by the original trilogy.6/10: well made, but void of substance.",6
2406,"It was a pleasure seeing Neo and Trinity in the same room again after so long, and that is the only nice thing I can say about this movie.The 4th installment of the Matrix feels farcical, riddled with meta-commentary, thickly layed references, and Marvel-esque humour that feels so out of place that one's eyes start hurting from all the rolling. From the original trilogy we're now derailed into a story that carries none of the gravitas and high stakes of the earlier movies, offers no fresh ideas or new interesting characters, and shoves nostalgia in every nook and cranny. Indeed, it feels like shots from the old movies make up half of the runtime. They are even shown from a projector in one of the scenes.Overall, a cringeworthy experience that left me wanting to ""cleanse my palate"" with Matrix 1-3.",3
2407,"Terrible storyline and writing. Completely missing ""heroes journey"" and it's difficult to have say what this movie was about and I've just watched it, the best way to describe the storyline is a really bad copy and paste of the first movie.I think the wokeness took priority over having an actual good storyline and it ultimately just ended up being a train wreck.",1
2408,Very surprised that this movie managed to do the impossibleI suspect it will take some time before people realize how good it actually isThe first half was pure meta pornAnd the second did all that I as a long time matrix fan wantedMATRIX IS BACK BABY.,10
2409,"A lot of nostalgia. I hated how Revolutions ended and felt like it was unresolved. I don't feel it has been resolved, but I'd rather be left here after this one than the 3rd. Honestly my only complaint is they didn't get Fishburne and Weaving back for their roles. Other than that I enjoyed it.",8
2410,"The difference between this and the original its astronomical!Looks like a cheap sitcom with really bad editing and acting.They totally ruined one of the best movies ever made. Lana, WTF happened???",1
2411,"Just finished watching this movie and it actually covered majority of what i was confused aboutFor those who gave it a low rating score, you're not a matrix fan and expect too much.If you're a a true Matrix fan, then i'd recommend to watch it.If you think i'm fake and just want to promote this movie, then think again.",10
2412,"All my nostalgia was gone. What was that? I just looked back to the past.I started the film with enthusiasm, but the further I went, the more I was disappointed. Goodbye Matrix.",6
2413,"I was going into the theater with my expectations low (7/10 at best) and I was prepared if it was an awfull movie. But to my suprise the start of the movie and up to the ""Smith"" vs Neo fight, aside from the overly large amount of bad characters such as Morpheus being more or less a hippy in the way he talks compared to the original trilogy and Smith also a but clowny. Biggest part I personally hated here was the Merovingians downplay; they made him into a 14 years old manchild that adds to the plot nothing other then bad filler talk while the main crew and Neo are fighting. So far the movie was a hit for me a solid 7.5/10 or so definitly not bad by any means. Since that fight everything went downhill VERY quickly. By the end of the movie it made me so dissapointed I could not even speak. By the time the movie ended i left the theater feeling very bitter, this is a background movie at best. Combined this is a 4-5/10 and Individualy the ""first half"" is very good 7.5/10 the ""second half"" is a solid 2/10.",4
2414,"Sitting through this movie felt like a chore.For the first hour, there was literally no story. No plot. Nothing intriguing. Only meta commentary of the Matrix movies. Self referential BS with just enough sprinklingof ""things what boomers think millennials do and say"". The lingo, the narrative and the overall feel just felt like a poorly written fan fiction veiled as an homage to the original movies.Then the next one and half hour was excruciating. The meta commentary persisted with blabbering overcomplication and circlejerking of the philosophy of choice.Imagine Deadpool without the humor andJohn Wick without the action.The side characters are so one dimensional. ""I love Neo"" + ""I must do the right thing"" and there you have every single character arc in that movie except for the villains who doesn't even have that much going for them.The creators thought meta commentary over this movie being a bad sequel will give them the immunity of being criticized of what it justly is....a money grab movie. Being so blunt about that makes it an awful awful experience to sit through it. Being meta doesn't allow an shelter of incredibly bad story telling.I don't recommend this movie to anyone who liked the Matrix movies. And let's be honest nobody is going to watch this movie if they didn't like the Matrix movies.",1
2415,"The first was an utter masterpiece, the second was okay and the third wasn't exactly good.I kind of want to tell Matrix fans, don't see it and to not to ruin their younger selves views of the series, because I feel that if I was scoring them overall then the series as a whole just took a massive hit!A word close to what I described the film as to my mate who saw it with me...",4
2416,This is okay for a time pass.Very short and limited storyline.Audio is pretty bad as well.It's like listening to people having conversation rather than a sci-fi movie.It feels like watching a low budget movie or a TV serial.,4
2417,This movie is boring from start to finish. No wonder they couldn't get all the actors back. And are there only transgender people in the future? Where were they in the first three movies?,5
2418,"The movie ended with ""Brass against - Wake up"" a cover of ""RATM - Wake up"" which where in the first matrix movie.It's a good song, but it's far from the original and would not be famous created by Brass against.The same can be said about this movie.It's filled with flashbacks from the first movies. If it's to fill out the lack of content or the director doesn't believe people remember the first movies is unclear. But instead of creating more connection it creates a greater distance to how original the first movies where. Even though the movie contained scenes and cinematic effect that was just replicas from the first movies.In my opinion the first three matrix movies (not the animatrix) had a deeper philosophical undertone. As I've watched them multiple times I've always appreciated the small undertones. In this movie I found them to be flat, repeated and so obvious that I sometimes wondered if the director lost fait in the audience ability to think for them self.The movie editing was uneven. The ""real"" machine world has the same dirty feeling as in the first movies, the new ""real"" human world was plastic and had a feeling of Star Trek. (To be honest I never really liked the Sion editing either (it felt like a Levi's commercial rave)). The matrix scenes where over colored with a special effect that didn't match what is doable in 2021.The acting was at its best entertaining in a humorous way and in it worst cringe. Without Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss there wouldn't been depth. But we already know these characters. The movie didn't let us get to know any other character. If Neo and trinity stood in the way of letting the us dive inte the minds of all the new characters the questions is what the new characters did there at all.Back to the song, Wake up, if the directors intentions with the song is to tell us that the struggle continues, only by new younger fighters, that does not need to be shove down our throats. A better way would be to let us get to know the new fighters. And if that's the case don't let and old fighter be the chosen one. That is hypocrisy.",6

2426,"No spoilers, critical review -There are bits of the new matrix that feel a little too light / not dark or gritty enough in places. There were a few very corny friendly robots but overall I had fun watching the film despite it not feeling as deep as the first one.Visually it was filmed with excellent CGI that wasn't distracting or overly gimmicky. I liked that it kind of broke the fourth wall a bit at the start.The side characters were mostly decent (other than just one or maybe two that could have been darker / grittier).There's definitely a LOT of messaging from the sisters around gender, identity and transformation which is more on the the nose / accessible than in the first films.There was a disappointing cover of a great track from the first film which harshed my vibe a bit it didn't have the same effect.The first half of the film felt a bit deeper than the second half.It felt in general it's probably on par with the second film in a different way. It was fun, it didn't move me like the first film did but I'm glad they made it.Overall I think I'd call it 6.8/10.",7

It had the opportunity and all the right ingredients, to be something special, but it comes across as a film where they just wanted to make something, and they weren't bothered if what they made was rubbish. Shame really.",1
2428,"I don't want to spoil the movie, so I will try to stay as generic as possible and to avoid talking about the plot. Well... there isn't much of a plot to talk about, to be honest.Compared to the mystical ""The Matrix"" and the epic war movie sequels (2 and 3), this movie contains what could have been a side-quest for the characters in a previous instalment of the franchise. Rather than a new movie, Resurrections feels like a cut-out scene from another movie, watered down to reach the desired length.Characters are quite shallow, the way in which they are introduced, or reintroduced, into the story seems lazy at best. Acting, aside from a few main characters, is average.I admit that my expectations were so low that I found the movie almost watchable, still not particularly good. I give it 6 stars because it would make a decent afternoon past-time as an episode on Netflix, but I am quite happy that I didn't have to pay a cinema ticket to watch it in the first place.There is so much more that could be done with the concept in The Matrix, some has even been lightly attempted at the beginning of this movie, but Resurrections really fails at resurrecting the franchise on the big screen.",6
2429,"I really like the idea of first half of the movie. It is truly a meta to the original triology. In short:Good for the Matrix Universe,Good meta elements,Very bad action,Bad storylineBad acting and mostly crap cinematographyIf you are a fan, you will like the first half. So it is not a time waste. But if you are looking for a traditional movie writing with character development, hero's journey stuff, you will be disappointed.If you are here for the action sequences and loved the old movies for that and just want to be entertained, you will come back here to vote 2 stars or so. Which means, you are gonna hate it.For me first half was about 9 stars and the second half is 3. In average, that made 6 stars.",6
2430,"The pace of the movie was very slow. Lots of flashbacks en almost no story.The movie was really, really boring. The new Morphius was ok, but the new Mr. Smith was just terrible.Maybe part 2 and 3 will be better.....",2
2431,"The nice thing about Matrix: Revolutions is that it doesn't bother to check any cultural boxes that seem to be all the rage in Hollow Wood right now. If you're looking for social warrior ammo, you're in the wrong seat with an empty clip.I started watching reluctantly. I expected to be disappointed and I kinda went along with my expectations for a few scenes before the film did a Morpheus on me and WOW... were my expectations stupid. This is a Wachovski, after all! What a fine piece of filmmaking to tweak the 2020's culture. The Merovingian's rant about today's culture really sums up the garbage that blue pill lovers gobble up today, doesn't it? I had to pause and rewind that a few times to catch it all. The red pill warriors are the ones dragging the mask off the face of society and saying, ""we are a free people and we can do this--TOGETHER!"" And the Wachovski sisters remind us for the 4th time that The Matrix franchise has always been a high energy, high action, high tech love story. No matter the setting or the time period. Hook up a good man and good woman, light the fuse of love and there are no limits to either what they'll do for each other or wrongs they can rightThis was a fantastic film and I want more, please.",9
2432,"While it has some enjoyable scenes, the story feels very disjointed. It's hard to connect with anything and I never felt any emotional attachment... which is funny now having seen the whole thing and reflecting back on it. The places, characters, philosophy just never felt very strong. Pacing felt slow, too much exposition and action scenes that didn't seem to be as good as the originals. I felt like there could've been so much potential for this and it was blown. Would I watch it again in the theater? I wish I had my money back and watched it at home.",5
2433,"This seems to be a Wachowski's original way of saying they were pressured into making a sequel they didn't want to make.At the same time, it gives them an opportunity to say what many people of my generation think out loud: texting is massively overrated, facebook and Zuckerberg are lame, wikipedia could use improvements and the internet has become the megaphone of mediocrity.They don't seem to share the enthusiasm of the hoards of people rushing to watch and like cat videos either.Don't expect the same feeling of being exposed to something totally new as with the first movie. Do enjoy the hidden messages especially if you share the point of view.The film's finale is a hint of humor towards zombie movies and series.",8
2434,"This movie looks polished, the actors (Original cast at least) are in top form. This movie is just so up it's own butt with it's story telling. It's sad, they are obviously trying hard...too hard... to please everyone, which in effect creates mediocrity. Too many member berry throwback moments, but not the worst I've seen. I'm going to assume a big part of the whole, free movie releases on hbomax thing, has to do with all the blatant advertising moments sprinkled in as of late.Action scenes are pretty cool and pretty well staged. It's a fun throwaway movie for sure, better than 3, but another major missed opportunity for a beloved franchise.",6
2435,"Let me preface this review by stating that the original Matrix might be my favorite movie of all time and that Reloaded is a highly underrated gem that has gotten undeserved hate. The third one was subpar because it lacked a certain kind of depth of world building and instigating second guessing your world view in an entertaining way. It served basically only its main purpose of finishing the trilogy.Now getting to this iteration. First of all, the trailers do a great job misleading the people of what to expect from the movie. After ten minutes it is already a movie different to what I thought the Trailers have suggested. You start questioning the movie's reality and the first hour is highly enjoyable. It serves a great new angle of what's come in the previous films.However, the first major issue here is that its messages it wants to convey are too much on the nose. Instead of subtly giving the audience hints of why something is bad the characters literally spell it out to you. If this would've happened once or twice it wouldn't have bothered me as much since many movie's don't trust their audiences, but here it happens quite often. Smart concept ideas are there but they're not included in a smart way. Nonetheless, there are some nicely put callbacks unfortunately mixed with some badly put ones, as well.Another issue I think Resurrections has is that some character behavior doesn't make much sense. To not go into detail or spoiler range but a program behaved in a way it didn't add up to what has been told to us and shown how programs behave. But that's just one instance of a few ones.The action scenes are alright, but unfortunately nothing extraordinary. There's even a new element which actually takes away a lot of the fun that was previously there.Then there's the climax and my biggest problem with it is its justification and how much it somehow misses urgency. The tension is artificial and you don't see a bigger picture for it as in the original trilogy for each of their climaxes.Summing this up, Lana Wachowski started this with some great concept ideas but it seems like she either believes that she's smarter than her audience and dumbed it down or got lazy and didn't put enough effort into this movie. However, it's alright to watch it once and the first hour was indeed enjoyable, but I probably won't come back for a full rewatch soon.",5
2436,"The scenes and premises were absurd, it was laughable at times it should have been serious. And, spoiler alert, they kept showing back-flashes of iconic scenes, from the First Matrix, while Reenacting the scenes, and it was just too forced, to try and get you to emote, from identifying with the old scene. It was obvious that they ran out of ideas, so they just forced this scenario where they used tons of scenes from the first one, to make you feel like the first one had been resurrected. And, of course, it was Overly Saturated with reenactments of ""Bullet Time"" and Kung Fu scenes. I Love The Matrix, and though I felt like they were forcing the premises of the story with the other two movies, I really enjoyed them, though they weren't nearly as good as the first one, but this one, well, I wouldn't have missed anything if I hadn't seen it.",4
2437,"In my opinion, the gun fire looks fake (computer generated, wow): no shells being ejected, and actors don't blink nor flinch when firing - had to stop watching it once I realized it was phony.",3
2438,"A lot of reviews have already been written about the new Matrix, but I will still insert my five kopecks...My husband is a fan of these films, and everyone probably watched such an unusual format at one time. Of course, I also wanted to see the new part, to go back to the past, so to speak. But the miracle did not happen!The new Matrix has nothing in common with those films, it feels like they made a parody of the legendary film! And by the way, this is the second movie where I fell asleep in the cinema)) especially the first half was unbearably boring.It's a pity that such an unsuccessful interpretation spoiled the whole impression, and we were all waiting for the next masterpiece!!!I don't recommend watching this movie, especially on the big screen. And I certainly don't want to revise it!",2
2439,"Absolutely mental that this is the eagerly awaited sequal of the matrix films. Poorly shot, somehow after all these years a film of this calibre looks so cheap and nothing like it's previous efforts. The special effects were so much better all those years ago, how did it end up like this?Badly cast, badly shot, too much talking and looks cheaply made. So disappointed.",3
2440,"I think the combination of my imagination, logic and philosophy could have created a much better version conceptually.The Matrix Trilogy was not just an entertainment film. Rather, it was a work of art / concept that challenged all human thought and logic.I're really sorry for the makers of Matrix 1 to 3 who endured such pain.I'm totally shocked.",4
2441,If you want a film that spells everything out for you because you cannot think for yourself with cheesy one liners every second sentance to remind you what franchise you are watching then jump right in. Shame they couldn't even make tye action not terrible.,1
2442,"Sad sad sad. What a pitty. Been waiting for this one for a long time. Poor scenario, poor storytelling, poor character development, poor screenplay, poor etc etc etc, On the plus side, some nice visuals, Keanu, Carrie-Anne.and thats about it. I'll pretend it never happened and re-watch the old ones.",3
2443,"Do yourself a favor; rent the old one. Same story, same effects but old one is better. I was so looking forward to watching this movie. It was real torture sitting through it in the theater. Real bad script, bad acting.",1
2444,I was so excited for this film. Its very close to a remake of the original. They find neo show him the matrix and so on and so on.Definitely should have not been made.,4
2445,"Ok first off, there are going to be the haters out there that are going to say, ""Oh it's not the first one"" or ""It's not as good as the original Matrix movie"". Well no duh. The original ""Matrix"" movie is an epic, once in a generation type film. The only time a sequel has been as good or better than the original is ""Godfather 2"" and ""Empire Strikes Back"".Now, with all that said and out of the way, if you are a ""Matrix"" fan, and loved all three movies and not just the first, I promise you are going to love this one too. The SFX are what we are used in a ""Matrix"" film, action scenes are good, the fighting scenes are good too.But the two things that really made this movie for me was the casting and the writing. I won't spoil it, but Neil Patrick Harris was the PERFECT person to play ""The Analyst"" and Jessica Henwick is just amazing in everything she does. The writing was absolutely spot on. Wachowski took the story, explained everything that needed explaining like they did in the original film, filled in the gaps of what happened between ""Revolutions"" and ""Resurrections"", and even made jabs at the studio for wanting a sequel in the process. What Wachowski did with this film is what J. J. Abrams should have done with ""The Force Awakens"".I rated it a 9/10 because there are a couple of things that don't quite make sense, and also the fight scenes were a little too ""sloppy"" with people just everywhere on screen instead of the ""clean"" fight scenes we're used to seeing in ""The Matrix"" trilogy. All in all, my favorite film of 2021 and I hope this is the start of another trilogy.",10
2446,"Just came out of the cinema in Japan, where the movie premiered today.The movie was good, real good. I do hope that it's successful and that we'll see another one because there is a lot left to be told.I can see how the movie would not be loved by every fan but to me they nailed it.If you're a fan, don't watch any trailers, don't read any reviews. Just go and watch the movie.You need to have watched the original trilogy though.",8
2447,"I see there were a lot of negative reviews about this or that. Fact... If you loved The Matrix and accepted the other two Matrix sequels, you'll love love love Resurrections! Haters are haters but this movie was awesome! Great story line. Fantastic graphics! Great movie to revive the Matrix franchise Do Not Listen to the bad reviews. If you don't remember the previous Matrix movies, then watch them and then watch Resurrections. You won't be disappointed! Ignore the haters. Thanks for the red pill Matrix!",10
2448,"A timely parable that rehashes a 90s movie that is mostly enjoyable, and a little heavy-handed, and finally drops all attempts at allusion and just has a character scream the meaning of the plot at you.",5
2449,Feels like an Tv low budget comedy of the real movies. And low acting from the new characters. Even the background music feels out of place and sync. I was really looking forward to it.,1
2450,This movie has been terrible since its inception since the idea of Matrix 4 was conceived. And appear as it was expected. The movie is more like Jupiter Ascending in atmosphere. I could not watch it to the end. Although I'm a big fan of the first part of the matrix.,1
2451,"I would have actually enjoyed this film more if Neo's video game career was indeed the real world, he continued to struggle with his delusions of blue hair and fake Morpheus, killed his psychiatrist, and ended up in a psychiatric hospital. 4/10 stars for providing enough nostalgia to encourage me to watch the original and wash this junk from my brain.",4
2452,"I only gave 2 stars and not 1 as there were few emotional moments I have enjoyed, but enduring over two hours of trash for that wasn't justified. I wish I just watched a five minute recap instead of watching the whole movie. Very disappointing.",2
2453,"Really liked how meta the film was, some people will be disappointed however I was not I really enjoyed the film action sequences were dope.however the story is very confusing as per but you already knew what you're getting into with this franchise.",10
2454,"Sorry, but this movie schould not have been made in this way. Cheap use of shots of the old movies, thin storyline, caracters without any dept or connection.Neo without his usual powers was the biggest mistake.Why, I ask myself. It could have been great restart of the genre, but it fell flat on its face.This movie is so wrong in so many ways.A great dissapointment.",1
2455,"This so bed, I don't even know where to start.Sorry this is not a good movie, this is just a way to make money on the name ""Matrix"".Original Matrix was a pioneer in every aspect this is just a blur copy machine. Even copy of the original move inside looks like cost cutting... so they made only half of the movie ;).",1
2456,"I was surprised by all the bad reviews but decided to take a chance on this one anyway. I was happy I did. I think going in with lowered expectations helped.I saw a review that said if felt like cheap tv and that is correct, most of the cinematography lends to a feel that they had to go the cheap route, dark lighting, the fight scenes lack a certain sharpness. Think what it looks like to watch a soap opera vs seeing something on the big screen. The production is way different.Without giving anything away, I think they did a good job explaining how and why there is another Matrix movie and how and why the characters are where they are. It did feel rushed at times, there is not much character development. I think if you haven't seen the previous movies this one won't make much sense as nothing is really explained in great detail.I would definitely say this is the weakest of the 4 movies but still feels like it belongs in the universe. I can see where they wanted this movie to go and am more than happy to follow along.",7
2457,From the start it's off. I am a huge fan of this franchise but to me 3 part was the last. Bad plot no awesome music. Just plain movie. Nothing new. Too much scenes from the previous films. Just sad 😔,5
2458,"Hard to see where this is going now. An attempt to resurrect the story but fails. Entertaining enough for Gen Xers but fails in plot meaningfulness, action and talks about itself 1 too many times.",5
2459,"It's been a while since I wrote a review but I think this movie deserves a balanced review, but also I want to explain those who haven't watched Matrix Resurrections why it is receiving so much hate and why it deserves a chance.The first reason is the most basic one: expectations. The original Matrix is almost IMPOSSIBLE to overcome. You can make a better movie of course, but not a better Matrix movie for one reason: the premise was so ingenious and new that blew everyones' heads. It also came out at a time where technology was not being used at its full potential and the Wachowskis came up with an extremely original concept such as bullet time.All those things are one in a lifetime breakthroughs and anything that follow-up with inherently be lesser. That being said, all the three sequels have been in my opinion more flawed that they could have been but definitely not bad movies, so I have to step up when I see the last installment is being treated as an Adam Sandler bad film.Matrix Resurrections is underneath all its flaws a very original movie, one that takes the source material and the lore very seriously and takes to the next level organically and ingeniously. The concepts, the new elements, the mythology are definitely canon and expand the Matrix universe in very interesting directions.The philosophy feels updated and more relevant to our current world than the first Matrix. Back then, being part of the system was the thing of materialistic and conformist sheeps. Red pills were for the rebels, the anarchist, those who dared challenging the status quo and imagine a world without boundaries and bondage.In 2021, the red-pillers are weirdos, conspiracy theorist and bigots who equally distrust science, politics, institutions and media but funily enough, trust religion, social networks and capitalism... Well, this is what Matrix Resurrections deal with; Projects the matrix cosmogony to a world where the machines already learned how to manipulate those who know what the matrix is and even those who woke up and supposedly disconnected already.Achieving this is not a small feat in and of itself makes this movie deserving of not only a watch but the same analysis that its predecessors called for. Now, of course there are a lot of flaws in the execution, the one closer to my heart is the poor fight coreographies. Every time I saw them (except a very short one) I feel what you feel when you see your old dad trying to pull the same physic trick he did when you were a kid. Nothing to do with the protagonists age, but the terrible miss of a good coreographer.Special effects are very decent but none of them is outstanding and some elements and characters seem out of place or purposeless, but there is plently of new stuff and fun to grant this one at least a solid 7. I'm giving it 10 just to help balance the injustice.Also, why it's getting so much hate: Twofold: lovers of the original Matrix mercilesly chastising it for not being Matrix 1 or not adjusting to all of their imagined expectations for de direction of the franchise, and on the other hand, self-called ""red-pillers"" offended when discovering (22 years late) that Matrix is woke. Oh boy big reveal for small minds who ignored all along that Matrix is the creation of two woke, rebel and extremely intelligent trasgender sisters who made these movies for those who feel like them, not necessarily for you.Also also, this is Matrix meets Sense8 and I love it for that!",10
2460,"The movie is good. All this fuss is totally unnecessary and groundless.This new effort if Lana's has all of her maturity: she respects the universe of Matrix, focuses on its basic elements while bringing another development, which seems pretty natural. No stupid comedy stuff, no naive dialogs, no excessive use of fight and explosion scenes. Great use of two legendary actors at their almost 60s. New faces bind together effortlessly. Exquisite CGI work, even nowadays. My only critisism is that it lacks of depth, compared to the trilogy's.This movie is a more direct side-view to our reality or what we realize as true. More food for thought is always welcome, well structured movies too.",8
2461,I absolutely love this film I felt truly nostalgic from the First film The character bug Steals the show I loved how they Got a fresh New Character And made it likeable Keanu Reeves was awesome and still had a cool handsome charm everyone remembers. It was great to have Carrie Ann Moss come back and did I mention the action sequences in the film? They were outstanding. I am so glad I got to watch this film A truly action packed film that now became a better Matrix film. My rating on the action scenes on imdb on this film is 8.5/10 story 7.3/10 General film is a 7.5/10.,10
2462,"Early on they make a joke about Warner Bros forcing this.I hope that's true.I am one of, seemingly, few that liked reloaded and even revolutions.I was so excited for this movie... and I thought it was terrible. Not good or mediocre. It was just not goodIt was bad I guess. Really bad.",2
2463,"If you're a sheeple, you'd hate this movie. This is because you're in The Matrix yourself. This movie is so deep philosophically in so many way. If you have a gold ball size consciousness then you would really hate this movie. If you have a bowling size consciousness, then there is a lot to take away from this movie.With all the junk movies the industry (The machine) has been feeding us lately and making us weak and dumb, this movie is refreshing.I hope one day. When these sheeples finally expand their consciousness, they can appreciate what this movie and all the other Matrix movies are about.",10
2464,"90/100Remakes, reebots and sequels these days scare the hell out of everybody since we've all achieved an intrinsic opinion towards. We've been watching giant corporations show us their take on them from the very moment executives realized, just like this movie says, ""nothing comforts anxiety like little nostalgia"". It got to the point where some people recieve exacly what they want from these movies. It's like these companies are willing to commit fan service as much as we keep watching these products based upon manipulation since they know everyone will be watching anyways. Leaving the film industry completely leaned against one side, where everyone seems comfortable enough. Almost the same concept of which The Matrix was based upon. That is why, whenever one of these big-budget movies decides to not give the people what they want but what the actual captain of the ship thinks as the most appropiate -even when that means creating The Last Jedi levels of divisiveness-, it feels refreshing.The Matrix Resurrections understood the fact that, to make such a drastic statement against Hollywood sequels, it needed to appear as one of them first. That's why, for me, I very much felt misguided watching the first act on this. I was stupid enough to, once again, not realize what Lana Wachowski had in mind all along. However, once you let yourself settle into the ride, it all goes thrillingly from there on.Yes, the movie has flaws. Funnily enough, it contains almost the same blemishes as other Matrix films, which unconsciously makes you realize that you're watching a movie directed by one of the Wachowskis, just like before. Only this time does one of the movies out of the whole franchise feel entirely realized.",9
2465,"Story about how Watchowski brothers were way better at making movies than Watchowski sisters. And yes, no clue how they tricked Keanu to star in that movie.",
2466,"Overall liked it. The action is a bit disappointing and some parts could've been better, but revisiting this world was cool.It is META AF, some genuinely cool&amp; creative stuff.",5
2467,"Please just leave it alone, please you will NEVER do better than the very first Matrix...we tolerated Reloaded and Revolutions. Just stop...just let it be as it was.",4
2468,That movie was a bad idea.First one was a masterpiece. Two sequels just introduced confusion. I understand that they were well possibly forced my WB to make them in order to cash in. They had them 20 years and I suppose full freedom for this movie. But it turned out sooo bad.I was hoping for answers. Instead they played on the sequels to I geoduck even more complexity and confusion.Bottom line: in the matrix each Programm has to have a purpose. Otherwise it has to be deleted. I'll put it like this: this movie has no purpose and should have been deleted after post production. Sorry.,3
2469,"30 minutes in I turned to my buddy and asked him WTF are we watching? Too much explaining, too many homages, and WAY too many plot holes. The first Matrix movie was revolutionary in the action sequences and iconic for its creative universe. The symbolism about people living their oblivious lives and not realizing what else out there really made us think existentially. Matrix Resurrections took all of that, crumpled up in to a little ball and let Neil Patrick Harris swallow and then vomit all over it. The climax was laughable when it just so happened that a character whose father helped design the resurrection pods, told her about them, kept it a secret for 20 years, and then just so happened to spill the beans to the rebels at this exact time AND know exactly how to go in to the belly of the beast, get past all the security to free the most important assets to the matrix. This all happened within about 10 minutes with NO resistance from the machines at all? Come on...how lazy is that? I'm tired of these legacequals retreading the exact storylines as the originals, trying to cash in on our nostalgia. But as long as we keep paying, watching, and clapping when they do it I guess we won't get as much original content - like the OG Matrix was back when it came out.",3
2470,"I watched a YouTube review from the Critical Drinker after watching this movie. It had 1.5million views and ALL of the main plot points and explanations for them were missed or incorrect (don't watch it before you watch the movie BTW). Not a single person in the comments said anything against the mainstream of ""thanks for being man enough to tell us the truth"". Could not one person say well actually there was a good reason for that if you paid attention to the movie and not leap to conclusions.. etc.I feel it largely flew above the heads of most because they had an idea of what they wanted to see, or saw something like that YT review and as soon as a hint of that appeared, had no mind to really listen, understand and enjoy.Anyway, I didn't ask for another instalment of The Matrix that is true, but now I have seen it I want another. I was a sceptic for sure, but stayed away from media to make my own call. To me, they really did a fantastic job of justifying this movie, well done.",9
2471,"""Welcome to the new world"" (of Netflix tv movie quality).Didn't expect nothing - and still was greatly disappointed. Watched it for free - and still feeling like being cheated -_- That's my story with the newest 'Matrix', lads and lasses !Meta approach can be interesting, but when 50 - 60 % of the movie is a self-referencing meta-fest you know that something is off (or even wrong, for that matter). With that being said, the first half is still promising though, while second fails miserably, with last 40 or so minutes loaded with some of the worst CRINGE I have ever witnessed.During watching this film, many clips from the original 'Matrix' trilogy is displayed on the screen to let you constantly know, that you still watching a Matrix movie and didn't accidentally swap the cinema. Sometimes it works but more often doesn't - and just feels weird, out of place. It's even worse than that, because this movie is WAY too self aware and goofy at the same time. That's a really odd mix, which - to be honest - is extremely hard to digest. I came to watch a Matrix movie ffs, not some low-key auto-parodying comedy pretending to be an arthouse production ! Music is bland, low-energy, uninspiring, BORING (where is Don Davis ?) and so is the action. Nothing particularly mind blowing nor innovative like in the previous installments. Some fights, shots and sequences look so CHEAP, that one may ask ""What was the budget for this movie ? Is WB out of a cash ? Who greenlited it ?"". Cinematography is - for the most part - lazy, ordinary, done ""by the numbers"" with a b-movie quality attached to it, so rather forget about beautiful and well-thought shots / sequences from the past. Shaky camerawork and on-knee editing reminded me of 'Bourne' movies, which worked fine there, but feels completely out of place in the 'Matrix' film. VFX / CGI is 'okay' at best, nothing groundbreaking which haven't been already done before.Lastly, one of the biggest issues is that a movie itself doesn't really know what it is. Tries to be almost everything at once : an action, sci-fi, psychological drama, philosophical treat, self-parodying comedy - and fails miserably in producing its own cinematic identity. Both Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss seem to be very TIRED and even embarrassed by participating in this project, seriously ! There surely was a potential for great film, but unfortunately it was criminally wasted. Be warned : you are watching it at your own risk and responsibility. Too bad, because I personally really wanted to like this one after franchise's 18-year hiatus...Knock, knock, Neo ! Next time don't wake up, please.PS. It should have been 3 / 10, but due to the quite good cast and moderate chemistry between characters, one extra 'star' is added to the final rating.PPS. To all people who give that 'production' anything above 7 / 10 - don't look for a higher substance or extra dimension(s) in this shell of a movie. There isn't almost any of it in this messy pretentious mediocrity of wasted opportunity.",4
2472,"Wow this was so unnecessary. Don't waste your time, watch the originals. NPH was the only decent thing in this and given his role that's saying...not much.",1
2473,"I hate to be overly critical of a Matrix movie. I think I'm one of the few that enjoyed all three of them. Obviously, the first one was my favorite by far. Aside from the obvious fact that two key actors were missing from the movie. The plot was weak! It was The Matrix in name only, they would have been better off calling it The return of Trinity. I really wish they would have never made this movie and that's a lot coming from someone who's watched the original Matrix 10 times.",2
2474,"I am not an edge lord or a hate-monger; if you like this film, that is entirely your business, and I encourage you to watch it for yourself and form your own opinion. The latest outing in the Matrix saga simply wasn't for me. The film is laden with heavy-handed ideas expressed poorly as part of a tedious and over-long narrative. Poor writing and cringe-inducing attempts at invoking nostalgia compound the existing problems, and even the Reeves-Moss team up will not leave you smiling after 2+ hours of confusion and frustration. Do as you wish, but I can't recommend this one. Better luck next time, I suppose.",1
2475,"This looks very much like a contract movie the wachowski sisters have no interest in making. A montage of clips paid homage to the last 3, nothing more.",6
2476,Awful sound editing left me wishing for subtitles. Heavy reliance that people will either have watched the trilogy again before viewing or possess a fantastic memory to link all the callbacks. Plot is very thin and the visuals are nothing special.,6
2477,"The movie is essentialy nearly three hours of flash backs (via scenes from the original trilogy) and the rest made up of modern remade scenes from previous trilogy, with a heavy dose of romance between trinity and neo.Keanu's acting feels forced and empty, with no passion behind the project, though Carrie Ann moss does a good job, the movies only saving Grace.The action scenes seem hollow and half done, almost like scenes from a TV series on a strict budget.The movie starts to get good when neo is ""awakened"" again, and you get to see the new alliance between machines and humans, with the addition of some crazy technology that lets programme's becom physical.But this is as good as it gets, the narrative, acting, script all seem rushed with no real purpose behind them, almost like the movie was made for the sake of it, maybe from being bored?The moody green and darker tones seen in the original trilogy have gone too, now replaced with bright clear colours that seem focused on keeping the 4k HDR crowd happy.Overall the movie is a casual evening watch when there's nothing else to watch, fans of the OG trilogy will be very disappointed, though I feel it will sit well with younger view's more used to the lazy style of today's movies.The ending does leave it open to sequels.",5
2478,"This movie is entertaining, it's familiar, it's cool because it reminds us of something awesome from our past. That's all the good that this movie gives us. The story is weak, the cinematography is bad, the action looks lazy, the writing is generic, the editing is choppy. The first Matrix brought cinema all kinds of firsts with cinematography, special FXS, story, plot, writing, story. The 2nd and 3rd Matrix films were not very good story wise, but technically they were always pushing with special FXS, cinematography, editing, it was good stuff. This new Matrix film, Resurrection brings nothing new, nothing ground breaking (like the original) nothing unique, nothing special. It's just entering, it's just generic. It plays like an expensive TV show and a cheap film. There's nothing cinematic about this movie, it feels like you're watching a made for tv movie. The writing sounds like something you'd hear in a TV show episode. The action sequences are weak and very much tv quality. The only reason I enjoyed this movie is because of the nostalgia, not because of what it is as a film. Watching this movie I realized which Wachowski was the visionary of the original Matrix Trilogy, that Wachowski DID NOT make this latest film.",4
2479,"I read reviews before i went to see it, so i had my expectations low, it really helped to watch it till the end. Characters are bland, so is the story, action is of b rated movies quality, soundtrack also not much to remember.. so yeah, best thing about this film is humour.If you haven't seen it yet just wait till it gets to some streaming service, not worth watching in cinema.",5
2480,"This movie was actually quite intelligent and entertaining. Looking at some of the reviews I have no idea what some people were expecting. You can't re-wrap the same old thing after 20 years, that's why this take on the original trilogy was clever and action packed . Will watch it again.",8
2481,"The Matrix trilogy was a work of genius. This movie does not deserve to be associated with the original three. Weak script, characters impossible to connect with, and truly bad CGI...I am going to forget I ever saw the movie and try and keep the original trilogy in my memory.",1
2482,"Saturated with politically correct garbage that ruins the movie. Stop pushing leftist, feminist, and woke ideologies and stick to good old fashioned entertainment.",3
2483,"There's a lot of haters and I don't get it. The movie was fun, the action was great, I enjoyed the story, the nostalgia and it was full of great individual performances. It's 2022, enjoy the movie.",10
2484,"Neo gets his butt kicked way too much, and for too much of the time he's a disabled has-been. A lot of it was redux. The explanation of the plot development was muddled and presented through boring dialog-only scenes; but the action &amp; special effects were quite awesome. The new Morpheus was very cool, and Pinkett-Smith added gravitas to the saga.",7
2485,"Maybe I just didn't get it, although I'm fairly certain I did. It's clear they had expanded ideas that had the potential to fit in another matrix movie. The execution of it all just was disappointing. It felt like Sense8 and Matrix mixed together very poorly. It was an action movie with a sliver of philosophy. It was loaded with flashbacks instead of foreshadowing. All that being said, I'm glad they are revisiting the franchise and hope this leads to something grand in the future because this definitely was not it.",5
2486,"Postirony. This is both a sequel, and a reboot, and a rethinking. Strange feeling, aftertaste. It is at least worth watching for the new emotions that the tape certainly gives. For some, positive, but for someone ... Like seeing an old best friend: he is still the same and at the same time different. At the moment, it is difficult for me to imagine another 4e matrix. Perhaps, after all, he measured the flower core for green and made a more serious tonality. It was nice to meet old heroes in a new guise and partly in content.Duch not all acting work is equally good, as well as casting in general. BUT there are a couple of excellent hits .: the artagonists are excellent (both type and alignment). Against their background, Neo looked like a man without deep principles. Morpheus is good too. Fighter, yes, uneven, torn. Chereshchchur saturated and colorful picture also partly interferes with immersion. There is a lot of fan service and references for the sake of references (as if we don't remember). The ending was too pompous and vulgar. This film will not attract new fans, unfortunately. It's made for oldies. What else could be done with the aged actors, to whom every somersault and blow is given with genuine difficulty? Without them, it would no longer be a matrix. The picture was a victim of past success and wasted time/opportunity to shoot it earlier.",5
2487,"As a huge Matrix and Wachowski fan, this one fell flat for me unfortunately. I had high hopes, but it was overall, a pretty meh film. I was skeptical of another Matrix film anyway, especially how Revolutions ended Neo and Trinity' story so well, but the second trailer hooked me.First, the good:The visuals are undoubtedly gorgeous, Keanu and Carrie's performances are top notch (as well as newcomers to the franchise - Jessica Henwick and Neil Patrick Harris), the fight scenes are pretty good (although not quite on the level of the trilogy), the soundtrack is spectacular (LOVED IT), and I appreciate what Lana was trying to achieve, but I fear the execution was subpar. I also liked all the nostalgia and tidbits added in from the previous films. It didn't feel too contrived or forced or purely for fan service. Also, anytime Neo and Trinity are on the screen together is truly magical, and beautiful. Probably my all-time favorite screen couple.Now, the not-so-good:The writing is not great. The dialogue in particular is far too meta, self-referential, and wooden. I know a lot of the trilogy's dialogue was wooden as well, but it was fitting and it was still well written overall. The dialogue and characters are just not it in my opinion. They fall flat, their dialogue is awful. Although the worst part about this film is the plot. We find Neo as a game developer with a bunch of bro-y coworkers who won't shut up. They're so annoying. Anyway, he's a game developer for a company that made the Matrix Trilogy (basically Neo's real story) into a successful video game franchise?? It makes no sense and is so contrived. I was hoping the story would make sense, because why else make a Matrix 4 when the 3 resolves everything. So there really wasn't a reason to make this film. Bummed this wasn't a better film.Still, check it out if you're a Matrix fan. But, I wasn't feeling this one. No wonder Lilly didn't want a part of this film.",5
2488,Horrible waste of time that adds nothing to the story. Purely made for the money. The first hour is basically a replay of the first movie. The second hour is just bad. Loved the first movie. The 2nd and 3rd were ok. This one was just pointless and bad.,2
2489,"If you like the previous Matrix movies you'll watch this one as well; no matter what the reviews are. But please lower your expectations as much as possible.The story is unfounded and boring. Nothing new or interesting. Once again it glorifies love but this time with emphasis on female character.The action sequences are not as good as the first film. The fight scenes are slow; probably they didn't practice them enough.Occasionally it feels like a B sci-fi movie with poor makeup and poor characters.Sorry, I don't have anything positive to say.",5
2490,"The Matrix Resurrections follows the progression of evolved systems, as explained in the original Matrix trilogy. At it's core it is an explainer of what happens when advanced technological systems receive an updated code.The philosophical references remain, along with what the future looks like after the events of The Matrix Revolutions.The acting was quality, except Keanu seemed a bit 'tired' which seemingly was a direction choice. I don't exactly agree with that direction, but it makes sense with the story told.Without any spoilers, the forced romantic elements didn't need to exist, especially in a world as complex as The Matrix.True Score: 7.5/10.",8
2491,"I'm agonizing through this movie right now, it just plods along with serious pacing issues. None of the excitement or inspiration of the original, a lot of telling not showing and sloppy fight choreography. It's just a cash iny, or an attempted one.I didn't care for the other sequels, this is the worst one yet.",4
2492,"I could leave a very detailed review of the movie, but why give the effort when it is obvious they did not making the movie.Just my observation... This is a chick flick with a bit of action. And the dudes who created the movie were dudes at the time the action and story is where it should have been for the type of movies they were. But now they are both chicks and they made a nice love story on how they got separated for years. But in the end love wins.... I mean come on, glad I didn't pay to watch this.",3
2493,"This was a jumbled mess, poor casting, messing with old storylines and a lack of character with the main character! Where was Neo? What a lame duck character he is in this film. Smith and Morpheus, give me a break... such a waste. I fell asleep and couldn't wait for it to finish, an absolute car crash and what is with flashes of the old films... boy oh boy what a piece of garbage and as a Matrix tragic, I was so so disappointed......",2
2494,"Hey boss. So I've been thinking. What the consumer really wants is a cross over of Silicon Valley and the Matrix. All the OG Matrix heads will love it because it'll bring back memories of how sick the original Matrix was and it'll bring in all the new dumb idiots who can't think for themselves and need us to serve every plot line up on a plate. Mix that with some absolutely hilarious comedy and transformers style cross human machine bromance and I seriously think we've got the best movie of all time so we can completely sack off any in-depth story writing. We'll bring in Neil Patrick Harris to lasso all the ""How I met your mother"" fans and scrap the cool af in Matrix outfits and replace them with a cross-gender fluid accessible inclusion style which'll make it impossible to review poorly. What do you think?",1
2495,I love the first Matrix-Movie. What I don't like is to see footage of the first one in this fourth part of the franchise. But that's exactly what they do endlessly and unrestrainedly. Instead of an exciting plot we get a horrible Clip-Show!,1
2496,In life they say you should never go back won't be has good has you remember. Movies can work the same way. I think anyone who went in expecting this to be as good as the original was setting themselves up for a fall two &amp; three where not near the first. So why people would expect number 4 to be. What it was was a nice walk down memory lane with great characters and an amazing idea for a movie all those years ago. I feel the new idea made this a resurrections worth taking and if you are a fan of matrix original. It's a welcome return.,7
2497,"The self awareness nonsense in the movie somehow tries to apologize it exist and to give it a chance, this is sign of low confidence from the makers. This already made me just stop watching. I have the feeling, the original Matrix was made by someone else.",4
2498,"I really wanted to like this movie but it was 2.5 hours of a lot of nothing. No risk, could care less about the characters, and Neo can't fly, and neither does this movie. Do yourself a favor, skip this one!",4
2499,"We finished watching, looked at one another and thought , what did we just watch? Basically it's a love story with a lot, and I mean a lot, of CGI. But the most complicated confusing love story-and it took 2.5 hours to tell it. Shakespeare it's not. If you are in awe of the first one -a tight well crafted story-please do yourself a favor and skip this. If you're board and need a movie to finish off your holiday candy this is it. Also this is a movie you can do to bathroom and not miss anything because you won't be able to understand it anyway.",3
2500,"I was really looking forward to this film after having seen all of the previous ones.I was massively disappointed after watching this, I just didn't understand why it was even made.Most films today give me this feeling.Where has the imagination gone?A true disappointment of a film.",4
2501,"I'm watching a movie I have seen before about watching a movie I've seen before. Boring on so many dull rehashed meta levels. It was like they said, ""let's take all the magic of the first movie, haphazardly recreate it by making it 1000 times more confusing"". The only meta I found relevant in this movie was it's self confession of this has all been done before and nothing new can be done. Even in the end, they never really do anything.",4
2502,"...because of what Merovingian the Analyst said, especially in the last five minutes of the movie. A cuff against social media and Generation Z. Ignore bad criticism. Enjoy the movie and listen to its messages......unless you are a 'sheep' and you continue to consume the blue pill.",9
2503,This movie was the biggest letdown of the decade. It was a sad excuse for a reboot and I honestly wish I would have never wasted my time watching it. If you love the original trilogy do not watch this movie. I promise you will be disappointed.,1
2504,"It was an insult t the Matrix trilogy! A rushed up movie which was not good at anything!!!The plot has something to say, it has a story to tell, but, the director failed it.It ruins every imagination you have about the trilogy and the cast!? WTF was that!??!???!? Only Keanu Reeves, Carrie-anne moss and Neil patrick Harris know acting?!??!?!??!I don't know what to say, Just horrible.",3
2505,"If you miss Matrix, go watch Matrix again. This is not Matrix at all! Horor.If you miss Matrix, go watch Matrix again. This is not Matrix at all! Horor.",1
2506,"I wanted to write a few things that I liked about this movie to not make my review just negative, but try as I might, I just don't find anything cool about Matrix 4. I could not suspend disbelief at all because from the start it seems like a joke. The movie is too self aware, making fun of itself, the studio, the fans, the characters... It simply didn't take itself seriously. It was played as a joke/parody and guess what, it's a completely different direction than the original trilogy.It goes without saying that the things I liked about the first 3 movies should be found in the 4th one as well. This was branded as a sequel, not a spin off or a completely different thing. I watched Matrix 4 to get more Matrix, not something else entirely.I was satisfied with Neo's and Trinity's sacrifice at the end of Matrix 3, I didn't need them to come back at all. I loved their story and the chemistry the had and it was one of my favorite aspects about the first three movies. I rewatched those movies many times but their romance never got boring. It always kept me at the edge of my seat how Neo rescues Trinity in Matrix 3, I cry every single time, with no exception. The end of Matrix 3 when Neo is blind and Trinity sees the sky, was one of my favorite moments. They were partners and lovers and it felt sincere and I wish I had something like that, because that's what love looks like to me. And that being said, I couldn't get myself to care 1 iota about their relationship in Matrix 4. Their love story was over, I watched it so many times, you can't get me anymore. It didn't look believable, their magic was gone, they looked like a bunch of strangers with different lives.And that's what Matrix 4 was about, right? Neo's and Trinity's love story. Well, it did nothing for me.The action was bland and cheap and it didn't feel as epic as any of the previous movies. Not memorable in the slightest. There was no tension whatsoever, I knew the characters were going to be fine, they knew it too. The enemies were shooting and missing them point blank. What's the point in even doing a fight scene without any stakes? For the martial arts? They sucked too! Not believable, they looked fake!Too much cameo from the previous moves. Matrix has been out since 1999, we have watched it too many times, or the people who haven't watched it then do yourself a favor and watch it. Don't show it anymore! Do your own thing and tell your own story and push the envelope. A few subtle references are ok, but those were as big as elephants, effectively playing the old movie in the background. This is some shameful stuff.There's more to say but there's no point. Matrix 4 had no positive effect on me at all, it wasn't fun to watch, it wasn't memorable and it wasn't what I hoped to see from a Matrix sequel. It only made me disappointed. Thanks, Matrix 4.",1
2507,Would you do something like this to the legend? This movie is bad from start til the end. This should have never happened and I hope another part is not coming.,1
2508,"This movie is an insult to the idea of the Matrix Story. If you didn't watch the movie, don't do it. Take the blue pill and imagine that the first Matrix is the only movie that exists.",1
2509,"The first half hour of our fourth Matrix injects us into a meta-meta-meta world, one that appears to be a little off, surely as if there's something They aren't telling us. Who is the They, and who is the Them? There are meta-brainstorming sessions that recall Key and Peele's Gremlins 2 Brainstorm sketch, which, unfortunately, packs far more lasting enjoyment in under five minutes than the 150 minutes of our newest header into the rabbit hole.It's not bad, but it's not great, and you might feel a bit stupider for having tried to understand the plot. The plot is not easy to explain because the characters who endeavor to explain it either bluntly bark monosyllabic, single-word expressions, or they rattle off Dennis Miller-esque soliloquies (in real time, in bullet time, and in flashback time) which make logorrhea less fun that it should be, and also which could benefit from a libretto.This rebirth of Neo and Trinity looks better because computer graphics became better in the last 20 years, but the choice of what to display feels inapt. Battling helicopters on skyscraper roofs might have been cool in 1999, but this is the 21st Century. This is the time for one last stand in actual reality.",6
2510,The visuals were very good and its the only reason it was 2 stars not 1. The movie plot was weak and poorly laid out. Characters were thrown together with not much thought or depth. The movie was mostly buzz words and phrases to keep young people watching. The ideas were overplayed and not entertaining and the movie in general was poorly acted and not worth watching. Besides cgi a complete piece of garbage.,2
2511,"First off all I couldn't tell if Keanu was playing Neo or John wick, his dialog was short with too many pauses and he sounded like someone that must recently learnt how to speak after having some brain damage. Everything in the movie feels forced and Neo feels like a super washed off version of himself. I fell asleep multiple times because of how boring the movie was, it took me 3 days to watch it. This is the kind of movie that should have been left alone and just remember the good ones from the previous years thanks to nostalgia.",3
2512,This show was a whopper of a disappointment. Numerous flashbacks and a run time about 45 minutes too long. Please don't do a 5th film. Some neat special effects.,1
2513,"Seeing a band that you loved in the 70s that was huge and original, now on stage in 2021 where the only original member of the band is the drummer and everyone else are hired guns half the drummer's age. They played all the hits you knew by heart, but they come off as tired and vapid and generally lacking energy.That's this movie in a nutshell. Neo looks tired through the entire film, and for the most part (until the last act) wanders around looking confused and needing saving every 5 minutes. Then he just wanders around looking bored while shrugging off everything the baddies can throw at him.Keanu Reeves is not a great actor. He can be coaxed to be a good actor, just it takes effort and time and multiple takes. In this film, everything looks like it was done in one take, bad or good with him (and mostly just bad) there is very little range of emotion, reminding me of the latest films by Bruce Willis, where he tries to add screen presence by simply existing, and it doesn't work. There is zero range of emotion or even personality coming though there. It's Keanu Reeves phoning it in and it shows in ever scene, and that's a shame.There are so many callback to the first set of films, that if you stripped all that out, this nearly 2.5 hour film would be about 15 minutes.Do yourself a favour and watch the first one all over again and call it a day.",3
2514,"Don't listen to all these people who obviously hate their lives and want to spit on everything. This was a perfect follow up to the trilogy. This in itself was fresh and new with nostalgic roots and is hyper self aware of its predecessors success and in no way knows it is going to out do it so it goes around it and gives us a feel that is new. Even has some tongue and cheek comedy that was perfect. It also gives us that happy ending the trilogy did not and reunites the love of neo and trinity. I couldn't have asked for anything more except for a part 5 and 6 because it sure did leave the door open for as much so go see it make it a success so we can get more of these 2 and the franchise. This story and concept are way too good to stop at 4, it was way to good to stop at 3, hence why we have a part 4 20 years later. The special things never die nor should. The story is modern and twisty showing us things the first 3 couldn't or never thought of, gives us the what happened next answer from the trilogy, just explores all kinds of questions we wanted answers to, the fight scenes are not as clean and polished as the original its more a mix of matrix and John wick but its still quality and engaging. Idk can't say enough good about it honestly feel so blessed that they gave us this movie. It deserved to made and the actors deserved this closure and quite possibly opened more doors to explore that are just as exciting.",10
2515,"To the haters, I say give it a few more watches to let the ideas sink in. I found it exciting, thought-provoking and emotionally satisfying. Honestly, if you thought it was dumb, you just didn't get it. Give it a chance.",8
2516,"I read all the bad reviews before watching, but I still wasn't prepared for this. Character replacements didn't feel like they are even close to their original versions. Big part of the film are cutscenes from the original trilogy that is supposed to create some nostalgic feeling. I feel like Keanu's Neo has no soul this time. His lines are just stupid. No clever dialogues in this sequel, most of it is about Neo loving Trinity. Rest of it is just explaining how they are still alive. I don't even want to talk about pet machines, but yes, they exist now. Even the action scenes and bullet time does not look that impressive if we keep in mind that first movie is more than 20 years old and still looks great in comparison to this. Even the matrix is more colorful and joyful which makes no sense to me. When other familiar characters speak, it is mostly just ""hey remember this or remember that"", just plain nonsense. This is a one of the biggest disappointments, watch it only if you can't help it.",2
2517,Severely dissapointed. Totally wrecked the franchise. DO NOT make a 5th.The storyline was good but what happened to rhe action. 2021 wokeness managed to dull the matrix down to a love story. I thought it was supposed to be an Action film.,1
2518,"It was boring, confusing, terrible tempo, no real/powerful enemies, zero tension.I really wanted to love it, I am a fan you could say of the original series. I was worried it will be bad but I didn't expect it to be this terrible.",1
2519,"This is not the matrix end off. The only good thing about this movie is the last 3rd of the movie and that's about it.I love the first 3 movies, first one being my all time favourite, matrix is the only film i have watched more then 3 times in my entire life and I consider it THE best movie of all time. Unfortunately this film did not feel like the matrix at all, huge disappointment.I am just gutted, this movie should have been called something else.",2
2520,"Started out great, but about 1/2 - 2/3 of the way through diverged into an incoherent mess. There's no logic to any of it after that point, poor writing, mashed together plot lines, incoherent characters (Smith, the Analyst, and Niobe specifically) and ending feels like the only purpose was to have a female empowerment moment at the expense of the storyline of the entire series.It's like Wonder Woman 2, should have been great but the point wasn't to make a movie, it was to make some sort of statement.",1
2521,"I've never written a review before despite disagreeing with a lot of reviews throughout the yearsSeeing the low score and reading some of the reviews I had my doubts about this film.I'm glad we all have differences in taste, because for me this movie was a near perfect closure of the first three films.I feared for the pace of the story,but I'm glad it was spot on. There's no feeling of rushing through things, everything is in place with some great callbacks.It's not a movie to watch without having seen the previous ones, that should be obvious. So if you haven't seen them, do that first.Then just sit back, relax and enjoy.",10
2522,"This is another prime example of how not to make a movie. The dialog is laughable. I've seen better special effects on YouTube videos. The uncountable mentions of ""The Matrix"" are cringeworthy. The plot was uninspired and at times rom-com-ish. I don't understand how the actors signed on for this garbage. No wonder Hugo Weaving and Lawrence Fishburne didn't return to this hot flaming dumpster fire.",1
2523,Ruined the franchise.Every character was destroyed and replaced with an inferior if not polar opposite to the original.The movie loses all its gravity and purpose.Every few minutes there are flash backs to the original footage which breaks the flow of the movie.Beyond horrendous.,3
2524,"Conceptually it was good, and so was the first half, but it just had too much talking overall, especially in the second half. Too many 'member berries. It needed more action, and better action too.Overall, this is a popular IP, conceptually getting more relevant with time, and I guess they wanted to use it since it's the era of reboots and revivals and such, so they cranked this out. But they should've stopped to think if they should -- and no they shouldn't have. Not like this, anyway.",4
2525,"I feel like Wachowskis just spat into my heart. I mean i knew it is not going to be the greatest movie of all times, but this....Please, erase this movie from the existence. First time in my life i am sincerely sorry i paid for the ticket.",1
2526,"I went in with the lowest expectations, keeping an eye out for the worst, and somehow I still underestimated the significance of those 2 hours of my life.So I suppose there's just one way to put this.Like Morpheus said: ""Unfortunately, no one can be told how bad The Matrix Resurrections is. You have to see it for yourself.""If you dare . . .",
2527,"This movie relies almost exclusively on flashbacks, memberberries and meta references. Literally 30-40% of the movie is made up of this stuff. Then the additional content is just action and scenes of exposition to lazily explain what's going on. It's kind of cool to see what's new with Neo/Trinity but this was clearly just a half assed cash grab for Warner Brothers. Sad to see what started as such a masterpiece end up almost on the same level as Space Jam 2.",5
2528,"If not for the Wachowski's shaky track record after the first Matrix I would have thought this movie was an attempt to kill The Matrix as a brand so that Warner Bros. Could no longer capitalize on it. Large parts of the script sound like Lana complaining about having to make this movie through VERY thinly veiled metaphor. In portions Neo is a blatant self insert for Lana to the point that they actually reference it in dialogue.""Did you base the main character on yourself?""""Yeah maybe too much of him.""The parts that include cringey marketing people talking about what they think makes the Matrix work felt like Lana complaining about her coworkers in the work they're forcing her to do, like a student writing a social studies report on the fallacies of public school. Just because I agree with you doesn't mean I'm enjoying myself. Just because you're self aware doesn't mean all the problems you are directly referencing about the movie aren't still problems - it just lets me know you better and did it anyway. I was expecting and excited for this meta approach but it comes off more sarcastic and passive aggressive than reflective and mind-bendy. I half expected Deadpool to show up at some point and wink at the camera.Tone is confused. The attempts at humour don't work. The moment Trinity is introduced a character calls her a MILF. Good job you sucked all the air out of the re-introduction of a character people have been waiting 15 years to see again. Was that the point? I hope not because you're not just thumbing your nose at the studio, you're doing it to the audience. Action is terrible and many shootouts are simply shots of one side shooting followed by the other side shooting without any clear idea of where our characters are in relation to each other. Zero tension. Zero style.The whole movie feels like cosplay. Laurence Fishburne's replacement does well considering the writing he has to deliver though I obviously would've liked to see Fishburne again. Hugo Weaving's replacement does not do well and comes across as constipated. The reasons in the story given for their change of appearance felt like excuses instead of natural parts of the story, like they were written after the script was turned down by these two. Jessica Henwick is good, but again the script fails her. Jada Pinkett Smith is entangled in some terrible old age makeup that is extremely distracting. This is definitely a role that should have been recast if you couldn't afford to age her in CG like Captain America.Cinematography looks cheap. I know basically everyone shoots on digital now but there are things you can do to make a movie look more filmic. This looked like a soap opera. The CGI is somehow worse than it was 20 years ago. All the megaflops in the world can't replace careful artistic intent. Constantly cutting back to clips from the first movie are a constant reminder of how much better that movie looked in every department.There are major changes to the rules of The Matrix that are explained through expositive dialogue instead of us seeing the things that cause these changes which means it all feels thin and meaningless. I really can't think of anything good to say about the movie.Some might think a 1/10 is harsh. I'm sorry but I don't believe in giving points for simply technically being a movie. This was terrible work, and Lana let me know through her script that she's self aware enough to know that. Maybe she should've let WB terminate her contract and unplugged from the machine.",1
2529,"If you want to go to the cinema to watch The Matrix Resurrections,you will not understand it because you are in the Matrix.Try it from the other side, watch it as the One.And above all, don't trust me or any other reviewer.Especially don't believe in all those swarm mode bots rating it as ""One"".No one can explain to you what is Matrix.You have to see it for yourself.Listen to some end credits song lyrics and wake up!",10
2530,"Yes, this is just a cash grab and a chance to check in on a beloved story and characters. Even messy, uninspired movie like this is still not awful. I don't regret watching it...at home (I would have been disappointed in the theater).Matrix build a world, an atmosphere, a mythology. The world still exists but the atmosphere and mythology are largely dead. The writing is quite bad, because none of the characters really get any development...and Neo and Trinity have theirs from the other movies. No understanding of the why that make human actions believable and compelling. Even the Smith reboot is undeveloped and uncompelling. Everything is just running on auto-pilot.The sad thing is it could have been so much MORE! You just have to be willing to be savage like George RR Martin and make the danger real, and kill off beloved characters...and not be a corporate shill doing the next installment of a ridiculous, comic book franchise. But, then again, who doesn't like beach houses in Malibu?",5
2531,"To me this whole film felt like Lana Watchowski explaining to the audience that a follow upto the original matrix trilogy is a bad idea and then she goes on to prove her point.Warner Brothers had told the Watchowskis that they would make a forth matrix with or without them and this honestly feels like Lana giving warner brothers the middle finger and purposefully killing the franchise... it may as well have just faded up to her sat alone in a chair and proceeding to explain that the matrix is over, that Hollywood's addiction to nostalgia, remakes and reboots is something she has no interest in and that any follow up to the matrix would feel lackluster and wholly unoriginal.The film ends with a cover of the same rage against the machine track that played out the original movie and that cover for me is a perfect metaphor for my experience of the movie as a whole... a weak, watered down and frankly pretty boring and pointless imitation of the original.Honestly the most bored and uninterested I've ever been in a cinema.",1
2532,"I have seen this update to the Matrix franchise 3 times and i understand why there are such low ratings. First it takes 45 minutes to get cooking, second its another fem-centric film which i have no problem with, there is a formulaic feel to all the fight scenes and keanu just wasn't there for this one. All in all as a stand alone film it was thrilling to watch but also a let down.",7
2533,This is a fantastic movie and incredible follow up. It's the second-best Matrix movie ever made.Keanu is perfect and delivers an honest performance about mental health and loneliness. It perfectly balances the reality (or lack of) of everything that happened in the original trilogy while advancing the story to a much larger world of the Matrix.Neil Patrick Harris is a classic Matrix villain who had his own limits and fell to them. I can't wait for Matrix 5 if there is one and this is any signal.The bad reviews are a result of unrealistic expectations and a fanbase that wrote their own movie in their head. It's nonsensical that this isn't much higher rated. The action is fantastic and the storyline makes you care.,10
2534,"So they spend the whole movie getting Trinity out of The Matrix!! The whole movie!!! And that's it.I never write reviews but had to make an account for this as someone who grew up with the original movie. There is no need for this movie to exist, it doesn't advance the plot at all from the original movie and doesn't add a thing to progress the story of freeing everyone from The Matrix. It's basically just rehashing the same story, for what?I was expecting them to get out of the Matrix in the first 10-20mins and then continue with destroying the robots and freeing the humans. It was boring.Also how can the original movies from 20 years ago look better than this? It has no style. I've just rewatched the original Matrix and it has great cinematography with the camera angles, lighting and sets, it's a film noir. This somehow looks ""cheap"" in comparison.And why are the sentinels redesigned to look like cutesy Disney characters? Also that after credits scene!! Why?? It basically sums up this movie, it's a joke.My only conclusion is that they have done this to reset the original to something a bit easier to stomach for a new generation who haven't seen the original. If that's the case then I'd still recommend watching the original Matrix instead and skip this movie completely.",1
2535,To start I'll tell you I loved the trilogy. I looked forward to this 4th installment. It started out fine but then slowed down. The first movie left my knowing everyone's name and purpose after the first 20 minutes. This movie never really made me WANT to know anyone's name. Fight scenes were slow. The plot build-up was slower. Many of the ideas were good. The basic plot was decent but the way it played out left me feeling like I wasted. To put this in perspective... While many people complained about different aspects of the recent releases of Star Wars I always questioned what they wanted to be different. There is no question here. This movie felt more like a cash grab than another installment of the original blockbusters. Watch it when it's free. Paying money for this just seems wrong.When they offer you the red or blue pill... stay in the Matrix. This real world is not worth it.,5
2536,"Imagine you want to remake the Matrix, but with less substance. Imagine you wanted to candy it up and water it down for an upcoming Saturday morning cartoon. Throw in Toothless the dragon and the cast of Sense 8 and you have it. Please don't watch unless you want to ruin it all. Dialogue is poor, action scenes boring, camera-work not interesting; far less of a movie than even the third one 20 years ago.",5
2537,"Wow what an amazing film. Smart, clever and some fantastic nods to the original trilogy.The ending is just brilliant and really captures what this is a love story between Neo and Trinity.The start of the film is incredibly clever and has so many nods to the first film.Can't wait to see where they take this from here now as it really sets up for a further two films exploring more of what happens and what they do.Would urge people to ignore the negative reviews and open your mind and don't be a sheep.",10
2538,"I expected this to be a flop given all of the negative reviews, but just give it a chance, especially if you liked the philosophy stuff that was jam-packed in Reloaded and Revolutions.",10
2539,"No good words, dude, really. Continuous recaps, bad acting....poor and inconsistent story line. Please stop advertising as a good matrix movie...it's hardly can get even to the shadow of the worst 3rd one...One great idea: the coffee bar name, Simulatte.... Cool 😚😚😚",4
2540,"What a waste of time. I wish that I had no expectations, so the let-down of this movie wouldn't have been so bad.Why is it bad? It is a completely unnecessary story. There's no reason to add to a complete story. In this case, it feels like 2 things: a cash grab and a chance for whichever one of the Wachowskis that did this one to add some of their rhetoric on life to it. A lot has changed in their own lives, so they need to ""paint the sky with rainbows"" in a new Matrix movie.A side note, this movie is ultra slow and very colorful. It doesn't feel like The Matrix AT ALL. It's pretty and flashy and annoying.",4
2541,"It was great seeing Reeves and Moss back as Neo and Trinity. I found the first half of the movie to be entertaining and on the fun side, but the second half of the movie lost my interest very quickly to where I started to doze off. I am disappointed overall because this movie really could have been something that gave the audience that missing punch that the last two were missing, but this one misses the mark unfortunately.",5
2542,"They tried their best to milk people who have fond memories of the original Matrix (which by the way, I think is a classic). Lots of rehashed scenes and moments that make nostalgia starved people go 'oh my god it's just like the in the original!'. Weird moments of comic relief too that just felt out of place.If you want a nostalgia trip just go watch the original again. This is not worth it.",2
2543,"This is an objectively bad movie. Disjointed in every way and any feeling of the original movie, even the original trilogy, is gone. I didn't expect much, and when my expectations are low, I have a great time watching almost any movie. Alas, my initial low expectations were too high. I got bored and my friend fell asleep 😂",2
2544,There is not much to say. This movie looks like you uncle that think is cool but clearly is not. Writing is bad. Acting is bad. The magic doesn't happen at all.They obviously just made this movie to make money.,1
2545,"The 90s were a mashup decade for movies. The Matrix was basically Pulp Fiction for Anime and Manga. The original movie was exciting but a lot thinner than people want to admit. The real strength was in the full execution, editing and full commitment to areas we've all been before with layers of pseudo-philosophy, slo-mo and sex-appeal.The Reloaded and Revolutions sequels were trash. As far as I'm concerned Resurrections is a sequel only to the original and maybe not a sequel at all. There's a few ways to look at this movie.As a Matrix Sequel? It's bad. I'd say D.As a Sci-Fi Movie? It's better. Let's say C+.As a Journey? Maybe best. B-.There's not so much going on in this thing other than a 'Reunion show' but for all the thin metaverse aspirations, there really could be a movie in here someplace if we handed it off to a better editor. That said, Jessica. Henwicks Bugs is the ultimate Blue Pill. She really does anchor this one in a way the other movies lacked a charismatic rabbit. Despite all Resurrection's missteps, lost causes and wastes of time, I'm glad Bugs is here.Resurrections isn't much more than a date movie set in the Matrix. It's all the bad parts of every Matrix movie; too much exposition, phony philosophy and hand waving action, but it doesn't seem to be trying as hard as the last two.",6
2546,As a 20 years huge matrix fan ( maybe i watched all triology 20 times in this time) and even i watched all matrix movies in first days when they come to cinemas and following every news from when i learn matrix 4 will be and after 2 years unpatiently what the f...is this ? I gave 5 only for small parts for watching from triogoly inside the movie and that was only good side of this and i will forget matrix 4 is exist.,5
2547,"To be honest, I didn't have high hope since lots of sequels are not great anyway.. and I was actually a little surprised at the first 20 mins of the movie. It's quite interesting they way they put stuff.But that's about it... start to be way too predictable and ALLLLLLL THE FLASHBACK/scenes they play from the first movie, this movie could've be way shorter without those and still work. Gets annoying to keep seeing the old movie. I guess the director just really want to make sure the audience knows what she's referring to???There are bits and pieces that are cool, but overall... it's just kinda boring? I fall asleep it's that boring and got woken up by the loud fighting scene.I'll say, I'm not mad about it cuz this is free that I'm watching it at home on a rainy day. But I wouldn't be sad if I didn't get to watch it even though I'm a big matrix fan... just watch the previews, they have all the best scenes without the nonsense! But still, this sequel is WAAAAAY BETTER THAN THE SEX AND THE CITY SEQUEL!",4
2548,"It is astounding that a large commercial organization, presumably intent on making investments for a return of profit, would ever willingly release a film production so poorly conceived and executed as this. Despite the twenty years that have passed, for a movie lauded as one of the most technically and thematically influential to receive a follow-up so laughably bad is truly remarkable. Countless flashbacks, silly villain speeches, clunky action sequences, it's a mess.",1
2549,"The movie is an attempt to milk viewers with the Matrix name by sprinklings some nostalgia here and there. Storyline is dull, boring and lacks sufficient background. Fine let's accept the fact that Neo and Trinity were magically revived for more body heat. Why and how is Agent Smith back? Why would the robots create an agent in the form of Morpheus? Why do the exiles want to kill Neo, what do they have to gain? Why did Agent Smith save Neo towards the end when he wanted to kill him in the beginning? How did Trinity's body even escape her capsule and with no red pill? Why does Trinity have the same powers as Neo? Don't get me started on the helicopter that decides to disappear because Neo and Trinity are having a romantic moment. The entire justification for saving Neo and Trinity from their capsules is simply weak. The black cat appearing at every dejavu moment is just cringy. I can just go on forever but I think I made my point. Just act like the 4th movie never existed.",2
2550,"It was so darn boring, after an hour I stopped watching it. The movie is full of explaining. The action scenes are ridiculous. During one action scene I lost focus, (like when you stare into the air), but I didn't feel like it worthed gaining it back. The only good thing is Keanu Reeves' acting.",4
2551,"Are people nuts saying that they do not like this movie? It is obvious that people do not understand the reference to the old with the old scenes. It not only explains but enhances what is going on in the present day for the Matrix. It is the best explanation of tying in the past with the present. It also makes logical sense, hence the logic of the machine world and the humans using said tech, to use the same constructs and references as in the past. It ties everything in perfectly with the present time. Sad, that people do not understand this. The second and third sequels together match the first, but taken separately the third was a bit lacking. This tied everything together nicely.When I first come across this movie I was very disappointed to see that the feel of the movie was not the same. I had hoped for a continuation of the same feel in cinematics as the originals. The video too for hd took away from it and made it and took away from the feel of being a block buster. The conflicting reviews are what made me give it a chance. I could not believe this movie could have a love hate reaction. I still cannot believe the criticism of the movie considering how important the backstory played in making the movie. After 20 minutes the new feel, definition, and cinematics felt right for this movie. The romance and how it affected the outcome was very well done. This is one of the best written and played movies beyond it being the Matrix.",10
2552,"This is brand new movie which have the same concept but also a different take on the original premise. The concept of Matrix is now matured and more grown up. For people who think Matrix is a bullet time scene alone, this is hard to comprehend. There was just enough fight and acrobatic scenes to keep the pace, but this was not the focus of the movie, hence the disappointment. Brains of average viewers are too contaminated with Marvel and DC spectacles that dialogues longer than 10 seconds are difficult to watch, but that's another topic altogether.Gave movie a 9, because there are few parts that were rushed, otherwise, movie delivers fully on what true movie lovers would expect.Now, watch it again and try and relax and enjoy it.",9
2553,"Since the tastes of the people and the new generation have deteriorated awfully, and Warner Bros. Is doing everything it can to make money, it continues to force the finished story of the Matrix and combines it with a new and popular style and destroys the previous three episodes, and only It's the cinema that gets hit.",1
2554,I was exited about this movie until I saw both trailers then the movie itself. This was nothing more than a reboot of first Matrix movie. There was nothing wrong with the original Matrix and I still think it is the best in the franchise. The characters in this movie were very lacking and of course they had to keep referencing the original Matrix movie. Overall I gave it a 3/10. The 3 is simply because Keanu and Carrie Moss were in it.,3
2555,"Is it the worst movie ever? No. Is it good? It's average. But compared to Original Matrix it's pretty pretty BAD, and definitely pointless. I will never watch this movie again. It never happened.",6
2556,"The worst thing ever happened to me watching this. And I have terminal cancer. Like real one.This story used to be part of my past, now I don't have one. Thank God I've pirated the movie.",1
2557,"THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS (2021) ** Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jonathan Groff, Jessica Henwick, Neil Patrick Harris, Jada Pinkett Smith, Priyanka Chopra Jones, Christina Ricci, Lambert Wilson. The Wachowskis return to the sci-fi action franchise reuniting Neo &amp; Trinity (Reeves and Moss in their iconic roles) in a mega meta way that manages to balance reality with surreality in recognizing the fact that life is still not what it seems. While the largesse of visual effects outweighs the heavy handed plot line littered with annoying new characters and not inviting old cast members back (hello Laurence Fishburne &amp; Hugo Weaving) the heart of its protagonists' love story keeps things pointed in spite of the overachieving ass-kicking and wow stunt work.",7
2558,"Much like Matrix 3, so many missed opportunities. The acting, choreography of fight scenes, and sound design were spot on. The story just lacked anything innovative. Had they worked with IT people to incorporate computers into the Matrix, something new might have happened. This screams that enough money was thrown at people to create a safe cash cow, rather than being innovative story tellers like the 1st 2 movies. Nothing new or original, glad I didn't pay theater prices and spend any extra time traveling. Everything but the story worked, music was same ole with a fresh coat of paint. The role reversal was just so wrong. New tricks for Neo fell flat. Where's the hunger of fresh story tellers that take a chance?",6
2559,"It started quickly, then went very slowly and then picked up, then dropped off, then eventually ended with me smiling.I loved the first Matrix, had it on VHS, Reloaded was OK, Revelations? Not so much.This edition has been left, with possibly another in mind.Don't get me wrong, this wasn't amazing, but it was darn good seeing them back together.The emotions of the characters I carried around with me for years, this helped me put those emotions at peace.This won't be everybody's Cup of tea, but I enjoyed it.Fight scenes and slow motion were abused as hell, some fight scenes were quite terribly directed as well, seemed like a brawl at a football match, but I don't care.",6
2560,"We have waited for years . Even the rumors were enough to make everyone super excited . I totally understand that it's not easy to write a scenario after the prefect written trilogy . But if you don't have a good scenario why you forcing it ? Just for money?!. It was more like a bad recap of The Matrix . Morpheus was a cheesy copy and still don't get it while you have the original one why would you go with the fake one? ..even the action scenes were exaggerated . We started watching with a bunch of friends and almost everyone fallen asleep after the 30 mins.Bottom line , I wish they never forced it and we'll be all settle with the first three .",4
2561,"Apart of being an artistic landscape, Matrix is everything that's being said in the meta commentary in the movie, and done right, by obviously the hand of Lana, makes it feel refreshing and now necessary.Also, it's kind of bolder than the last ones, because it's adressed so immaculately the villains and their motivations towards the development and adaptation of the matrix, making neo face the same problem as before, but now thing have been changed permanently by the inspiration of the hero arch presented in the trilogy.So i think it was almost if not perfect. Mixing the great action and effects with the knowledge of continuity of this seemingly eternal fight i left the theater thinking of empathy and relieved.",10
2562,Not all that good. It is better than the 2 and 3 but that doesn't take much.It really feels like a sort of redo of the original. Fortunately I was able to watch it on HBO Max. If I'd paid to see this I would have been disappointed.Not a bad movie but not a great one.,6
2563,"The Storyline was convoluted, confusing and just plain goofy to the point I lost interest pretty quick. It was almost a spoof of the previous 3 movies. THIS movie should never even be brought up when discussing The Matrix movies. What a let down. If you have HBOmax and have 2.5 hours to kill, and you're a die hard matrix fan, then maybe watch it. If you don't meet all those criteria, just skip it, and pretend like it never happened. Like I do the last Indiana Jones movie.",3
2564,"If you wonder why you didn't hear much buzz about this movie and you are tempted to blame COVID-19 for that, please refrain from making that kind of association. No, my friends, this movie is just plain bad. I wish I had trusted my instincts about it, but I failed to do so. I'd take a pass on this one if I were you.",
2565,"Some clever bits in setup, but rather all over the place.I guess the line about Warner Bros wanting another trilogy was bang on.Man, this dragged.",5
2566,"They put as much unessential fighting as they could. I switched off till and came back when I thought there would be something meaningful going on, but alas, no.Cashing in on on the name. In a word; boring.",3
2567,"By the third act it becomes literally unwatchable. I had to turn away. The cringe. The cheese. The senselessness. The cash grab. The Meta. Literally every aspect of this idea is nothing but a boot to the chin of the original - MASTERPIECE - of a movie, called ""The Matrix"" - Go watch that one and pretend no one ever made another one ever again.",1
2568,"I was actually really enjoying some new concepts they added, the 4th wall breaking, the subtle messages that appeared to be told directly to people who did not see the first Matrix as a metaphor to things that happen in the real world but then the movie collapsed all around. Action scenes and effects were terrible and plot became dull. I do not think this was a crash grab it just didn't work at all. Still loved some of it specially the messages in the first half of the movie and some callbacks. Nice try but sadly back to death.",5
2569,If you looking for ground breaking action scene's this is not a matrix for you.It's all about love and romance with some hand magic to move or repel oncoming objects to space.I have no other words.,5
2570,I'm a Matrix fan. I was excited as hell when it was announced this would come out 12/21.I was looking forward to so mind blowing thought provoking dialogue and cgi effects.This iteration fell flat in all my expectations.The matrix is about explaining the illusion Simulacra and Simulation!!It seems everything made nowadays is low brow and without depth.,4
2571,"Disgusting. It's a shame they spoil a trilogy for a little more money. It's even more embarrassing that they don't even invest in special effects, what stood out from the Matrix movies was undoubtedly the excellent action scenes. Sad. You realize the fraud when you see that they do not even invest in costumes and supporting actors. Sad.",4
2572,"Lana killed it with a script, so detailed development of Matrix, haters just wanted first film, simple and same bit this is true development of story, natural way of things in that universe, action for me is lil bit rushed, fight scenes could be better but anyway story backed up everything, please don't ruin it with rushed reviews and 1 star, doesn't deserve it.Film is good, nostalgia is great!",10
2573,Quite literally the worst movie I have ever seen. The only way I can describe this movie is if you were watching a bunch of people that were obsessed with the original Matrix watching trying to reenact the first movie. I mean they literally replay scenes from the original movie.,1
2574,"Watched today 12/30 at the theater. I thought it was great. Just the right amount of action and evolving of the storyline. I have read several low ball reviews and couldn't disagree more. The story line was good. I mean it's been 20 years so you can't just slam Neo and Trinity back together along with other past characters. Also those several past characters had to be brought up to speed. The new cast member meshed well with Neo, Trinity and storyline. Plenty of action scenes with Neo exhibiting his ultra power. So yes 9-10 and it's also setup for a Matrix 5.",10
2575,"This movie was perhaps the most insulting movie I've ever seen on my time on earth. As a big matrix fan it was hard enough to get over the battery decision, &amp; the inevitable 3rd movie so, so ness. BUT this joke of a film was absolutely the worst in every way possible. They did everything wrong, with the exception of Eréndira Ibarr's look, which I thought was cool. I thought they should've had something like Neo teaching someone younger if they wanted to continue the series. Instead they walk us through Neo ""discovering"" his abilities once again &amp;...whatever it's not worth the time to explain lol, I could go at length. 1 star, in fact the movie should've never been made. It's insulting because of how much they could've done yet choose mediocrity at it's BEST. It's actually worse than mediocrity. I saw the movie the moment it came out &amp; didn't feel it worth to even comment but hey, I got to it smh...",1
2576,Don't do it. Don't watch this. As a fan of the franchise I cannot recommend this sad excuse of a Matrix Movie.I had high hopes. I ignored the criticism and gave the movie the benefit of the doubt. What a waste.Don't do it.,2
2577,"This movie makes you think and reflect, are you ready for it?It is a great movie and I will see it again.Rating for me is an 8 but I gave a 10 as a statement against the ridiculous low ratings some people gave.I suppose it is all about expectations and what people understand, and how they can relate to the story, the analogies and perceptions.I like it when I am surprised and taken to unchartered thoughts and reflections and Matrix 4 does this all along. If open to it, one can see and hear many aspects of our society and humans' behaviours. So true. And yes, it is time for changes.It is definitely different from the 2 and 3 movies which are more conventional. This one is not, and I do prefer it from the previous sequels.Definitely to be seen at the cinema!Enjoy :-)",10
2578,"Just like everything else that is rebooted or remade a large group of folks will hate it for no reason.This is the best Matrix after the original.

2579,"I came in thinking this would be abysmally bad it wasn't but it wasn't great it was definitely unnecessary and pointless in every single way but I wasn't incredibly bored so I can't say it was bad, the jabs on constant sequels and reboots urked me like trying to be funny or something and just coming off as foolish. The action was incredibly lackluster amounting to mediocre punching and kicking and a couple scenes of neo blocking bullets I didn't mind the bike chase with the zombie things but other than that all bad why were most all the bad guys just swat guys instead of agents. The characters were undeveloped and basically irrelevant Morpheus was terrible and I didn't understand his origin as it was incredibly rushed doesn't help that it wasn't Lawrence fishburne same with agent Smith no cool final battle, worst offender for the cast was the architect just so bland and contributed nothing even the random side characters with guns did more and they msme the random side characters with guns in the first one look like main characters.Basically this movie was a sloppy cash grab sequel that wasn't horrible but served no real purpose and whwd an incredibly rushed story which barely makes sense if you think about it a bit it's worth maybe one watch can't see myself rewatching.",5

I didn't listen, instead I chose not to believe that this new Matrix movie couldn't possibly be as bad as they all said it was. I feel betrayed after the movie, I even dozed off at times during it.

The performances are good but the plot leans heavily on it's predecessors, and it's missing the magic that made the trilogy so special.",5
2593,"First, I will confess to being highly biased so two stars given because of this, lol.Very average plot and script but great seeing Neo &amp; Trinity together again. Decent job of bringing some characters back and some new blood attached. Obviously they couldn't bring all of original cast based on budget so I wish many could get over that. Would have been nice to see original Morpheus and Agent Smith but not needed with this script.Maybe, just maybe they'll make another Matrix follow-up and they'll have guest appearances.",7
2594,"Llike other negative reviewers.. i just don't feel the 'uniqueness' / 'iconic' / 'The Matrix' like the previous movies.The first half bit is actually good. But then it went downhill very fast..It only serve as nostalgia, those who want happy ending and some women empowerment.-SPOILERS-Neo seems nerfed.. so much of being ""The One"" (although there are many theories) but still.. the movie include a scene how he easily defea t agent smith blocking all his attacks with eyes closed, bullet time.. and now he can't do anything.Flying Trinity.. I'm okay with that if Neo has new ability, He's a programmer who create simulation inside simulation.. what about he trapped the analyst in a created simulation of the making of The One who see through the matrix and easily manipulate it.Hey i'm all with women empowerment and feminism but don't do it in a cheap way. Is this supposed to represent equality of the rights in the matrix? Lol..Trinity and Morpheus are already iconic figure in the original Matrix.The only supposed to be 'iconic' moment is when they holding hand and come an explosion.. err.. how cheesy is that.. and so is the ending..As for new Morpheus.. i think it should cast both.. probably real morpheus in the matrix and the new one in the real life in the form of that silver particle though i understand it might contradict the story of the new city.As for new Smith.. I'm a bit biased.. I love them both.. since I love Jonathan Groff from mindhunters.Smith's story in this is actually great. So it's a plus.I probably has to praise the 'Meta' and deceiving by making video game idea. And the story about new city and Synthients. And Smith's role.I've watched it twice.. But still the bad outweigh the good.And twice i feel sad.. disappointed..End credits scene is stupid..",5
2595,"When my girlfriend and I finally got to the precious credits of this ... ""thing"", I noticed out of the wachowskis only Lana's name showed up. Immediately my girlfriend and I speculated about why the other Wachowski had nothing to do with this film, mainly because of the instant recognition that had they both been there, it would obviously have been much better. We had no real knowledge before this terrible terrible time suck about who of the two was the more talented one or if they simply both are and therefore as long as one worked the project it would be good, but now we are so certain that the magic doesn't originate from Lana that I will check any future movies to make sure both sisters directed or that only Lilly directed but anything that only Lana directed will immediately go on the ""play this only to torture terrorists"" list!All in all I just want those two hours back.",1
2596,This film is just a huge dump on the face of the original. Panders to nostalgia and has nothing to say.The first hour that I could bare was just remembering the original. Action was fun but stupid.,2
2597,"Keanu Reeves is awesome in anything and his remake of the matrix movie is just great. Don't bother with the bad reviews. See it yourself and enjoy. It is well done and thought out. Great cast. Great plot. They probably won't make any more matrix movies again. So this is a great end of the line story. Imagine yourself in Neo's predicament and his search for reality in what is real and what is not. What if this world is a matrix? But instead of digital it's biological? There is more ""space"" than actual matter in reality. So we are all in a type of matrix ourselves. This world isn't really reality. It's what's after we die the real reality truly begins. We also have a choice like Neo, red pill, reality, blue pill, the lie. Our red pill is belief and surrender to Jesus, His life, atonement, resurrection, and soon return. The blue pill is rejecting the red pill. Don't think I'm telling the truth? Look around, read your Bible, you be amazed to know I'm actually correct if your honest enough to find out yourself. Time to take the red pill, trust in Jesus, find the true realty or don't and be left behind in this lie of one. Your choice. Choose wisely.",9
2598,After reading many reviews it seems a lot of people aren't crazy about this movie. I LOVED this movie. The movie is a love story and it gives the whole matrix saga a better ending than the last one because in the last one both of them died however in this one it is a love story about Trinity and Neo coming back together and it gives a whole matrix saga a better ending also I really like that in the last matrix (the third one) Neo came to a truce with the machines and I really appreciate that in this new movie they didn't go back on their promise and it was like some stupid war rehash thing this movie is about a love story about Neo and Trinity coming back together and having a happy ending and I think this movie is the perfect ending to the whole matrix movies and I really liked it I think it was really well done and it gives the whole movies a way better ending and I feel satisfied with everything. Give it a chance and don't let these other reviews mess with your head. Follow the white rabbit. (Also sorry I am driving to work and using the hands free speech to text),10
2599,"The story alone is clever enough to make all Matrix fans laugh and cheer as I did during the first 30 minutes of the film. The use of visual allusions in order to reference the original trilogy tied with quick-cut flashbacks and a mind-bending new plot make The Matrix Resurrections one of the most sophisticated movies I've seen in a long time.I was nervous about this reboot initially because I wasn't sure how Wachowski was going to bring back Neo and Trinity after the events of the 3rd film. However, my expectations were blown away by the intelligent and refreshingly witty script. I found myself laughing out loud and saying ""that's awesome!"" multiple times. The movie even makes fun of itself during the beginning when talking about creating a Matrix 4. I can't remember the last time I had this much fun watching a movie and cheering for some lovable and familiar characters.I do recommend rewatching the first 3 films (or at least the original) beforehand so that it's fresh on your mind and you can truly appreciate what was done here.Reeves is still awesome as Neo (even while pushing 60 years old in real life!) and Moss holds her own. It was great to see so much of the Sense8 cast on screen together again too. The visual effects are stunning as well, taking us in and out of different worlds seamlessly and giving life (and human emotion) to machines.Nothing will ever top the thrill and originality of the first Matrix, but The Matrix Resurrections does the material justice and (in my opinion) slides in as the 2nd best installment of the franchise.Verdict: Watch.",9
2600,"Honestly I only watched it out my respect for Keanu Reeves and Neal Patrick Harris. If you want to watch it just put it in the background and do other stuff. Only if you do that it will be watchable. But other than that I couldn't really get my self to watch it with without making eye rolls, exasperated sighs, and etc. I really really hoped that it would be good, that it wouldNot prove me right about my own personal theories that I made about the movie.",2
2601,"Campy and unwholesome, seemed like part parody, part clip show and the rest just typical action scenes and randomly inserted history and characters we didn't even know existed. They can just do whatever the hell they want. Would have been better to have done a prequel or at least something more original than this, which might have justified new characters or taking things in other directions down the line. Definitely did not feel any intensity from this film the way I have with others.",1
2602,"There's a lot here for you to be entertained during the 2.5 hours of matrix resurrections. Fun visuals, quirky moments, old characters coming back... but...There's also a lot missing here from the originals. Especially when it comes from a trilogy that was the first to do many things on camera. Noticeably many of the scenes do not seem storyboarded to the point of perfection... and much of the slow motion doesn't look well done. There's shots reminiscent of the originals, even copies of them but even those are missing the stylistic elements and framing. This film looks shot and edited by a fanboy rather than the original team. Matrix 1 had such a small budget that it was widely known the directors had perfected what they would shoot before they showed up to do so. In this film the lack of polish reveals the age of the main characters too much when they're in the sim world to the point they look slow and feeble during fight scenes. Instead of insanely awesome fighting, Neo is simply restricted to holding his hands out to push people off by energy. Even John wick does it better than this film.Editing also appeared rushed, favoring forward story movement over moments of focus. Most will probably not notice why they aren't feeling anything until the very end when it simply just .............Story wise this film seems to make the rest of the trilogy into some funny joke, lacking any seriousness... even plays the original film as ""cut scenes"" of the video game mr Anderson developed. Often times these random cut scenes are played after the new (crummy) agent smith or (crummy) new Morpheus do their own rendition of the original scenes. I did not like this sloppy attempt to connect to the old films. If anything it shows off the original wide frame and well storyboarded high stylized shots in comparison to the new and bleh.I'll still rate it well since it wasn't a stupid reboot. Unless that's what they were hinting at by giving trinity all of neos powers.....",8
2603,Pet Sematary should have taught us all a lesson. So should Muhammad Ali's life. You need to know when to quit. The fight scenes with Keanu (or his stunt double) are horrible. If you pay close enough attention to his character in the warehouse fight scene then you will see how bad it is. The story for the most part is convoluted bs. It is not completely 'woke' but you will note that female characters have replaced men in many key roles. It was a minor distraction but you can tell that it was intentional and forced. I watched it for free and was still disappointed. If you must pay for it then go to the matinee.,4
2604,"Nothing new or groundbreaking but full of political commentary, nostalgia, and some sweet old romance. Worth watching to compare to original but be prepared to be somewhat disappointed.",7
2605,"First, the good: Storywise, maybe this is not the worst ""Matrix"" movie. The bad: Almost everything else. This movie exhales movie production failure everywhere (caused by severe apathy, budget cuts or both). 80% of the movie has a long TV series pilot episode quality. It tries to be a soft reboot on the same vein as The Force Awakens, but where The Force Awakens hits in the right places (even when repeating the ""they have a bigger Death Star"" trope), Resurrections amazingly fails.There are so many wrong artistic choices that they must be intentional. The line delivery by the supporting actors removes any ""gravitas"" that the originals had. They went with a more happy/jolly style when in the matrix. The fighting coreography is atrocious. The fighting scenes editing was changed to the fast-cut style that undermines what is happening on screen. The bullet time FX is better even on low budget games. The only visually good scenes are in the ""real world"". Even the sound design and music selection is ""meh"". They tried a more ""saturated but balanced"" color grading inside the matrix as a way to move the story forward, but that means that we didn't even get that characteristic matrix look.Finally, although the story makes sense and was a good spot for a reboot, they somehow ended up with an underwhelming ending.Play the demo, it is a better time investment than this.",5
2606,"Hey I'm the most anti woke guy there is... I was following Jones before he made it on youtube.... saw the movie... and it is not the greatest movie of all time... but can't really understand the hate is getting.... it continues the story, it explains what happened with Zion, morfeus and the the old matrix, explains what happen with the Robots that accepted the peace with the humans, explains how the humans evolved in the 60 yeas that past... it explains why this Chosen one was so special and what made him special...something that was very well explore since matrix one and his connection with trinity... introduces this cool concepts of a matrix within the matrix, AI machines factions, Smith being rebooted into a new body and being awaken by anderson, the new matrix being one of complacency and control with Social media and NPC real NPC people walking among real humans... the concept of humans being put into stress producing more energy ...right away you see that the new matrix is identical to our world...it even hat Covid ....all the catastrophes the Annalist could dreamed to create stress and produce more power out of humans....contrary to what I heard from a lot of sites this has very little trinity... why It took so long for Neo to wake up...he was 60 years on the Matrix...how trinity got her powers so fast....60 years in the matrix the moment she regain consciousness was the same as Smith...why Neo took so long...maybe it was all those blue pills he was taking.....using the slow motion and rewind against Neo himself...shows how the Matrix even adapted to people like Neo...they even retired the agents since they had the NPCs...almost like we have those raging NPC mobs ready to take orders from social media.....I don't know if it is this super divided times we are living now...but the movie does not deserve the what it is getting... like this is more true to the source material, than the new Ghostbusters movie...like come on guys yeah the Fembusters was the worst spin on a classic...right there with the last star wars trilogy...but having kids ghostbusters, it was really not that good.... I know some took it as..."" we better get behind this one or the Fembusters will win the argument""... but it was not that good ...a 10 compare to the fembusters ...but not a jewel... and this movie is definitely not the bad movie they are making out to be. ...I will give this one a 7/10.",8
2607,"This movie is a parody on the original trilogy and mocks it quite openly throughout the entire view. The scene, when the creative group brainstorms ideas for the fourth part of the game, pretty much covers the way this movie has been created - every ridiculous and trashy idea has been meticulously woven into the fabric of the story which unfolds afterwards. Even parts of the story which are supposed to be serious don't hold up together - plot holes everywhere, explanations don't make sense even within this movie, let alone within the whole franchise. And the cherry on the top - towards the end the Analyst literally says ""bullet time"", totally ruining everyone's immersion (not that anyone could still possibly have it by that time).",1
2608,"The long awaited fourth Matrix film finally debuted, following a Covid pandemic delay, in December of 2021. The question is after nearly 20 years, despite Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss returning, is there still content to mine in a Matrix based story. The movie suffers from not finding a way to include either Hugo Weaving or Laurence Fishburne especially if you are just revisiting/rehashing the mythology that was originally set up in the first three films. Lana Wachowski returns as producer, writer and director, but her sister was not a part of this film.I struggle with how to think about this film. Overall there are aspects of the updating that I found cool and fascinating like the initial part that was so incredibly meta and clever to have Thomas Anderson back in his normal life and the whole Matrix thing be just a video game that he designed. That is a very interesting way to start the story, and also makes a lot of sense. From that initial premise they lost me with the dense plot and their new tricks time and again. Much of the plot and expansion felt like a sly way to not only bring a 20 year old franchise into modern day pop culture but also to essentially revise/retcon Matrix mythology to have it more in line with modern day sensibilities. For example in 'The Matrix' Trinity was an extremely badass character, however, her primary purpose was to be Neo's love interest. It was clear in 'Resurrections' they wanted to mess with the power of ""The One"" and make it more of a shared thing between Neo and Trinity bringing her up to more of an equal footing with her male counterpart. The problem for me is since the story didn't start that way it feels disingenuous to change it with little to no explanation as to why. The narrative did not do a great job of underscoring really what was going on at any given time so while I could easily understand the get Neo out of the Matrix and then let's save Trinity almost everything ancillary to that entered that Matrixy style techno-babble that lost me. For example early in the film where they discussing a modal simulation and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's character is introduced, and I had no comprehension of what he was or why he was or where he came from and similarly later on when The Analyst has his explanation moment (very similar to the Architect in 'Reloaded') or when Agent Smith, in the form of Jonathan Groff, showed up none of that made much sense. It also seems clear they were messing with the Neo/Trinity power dynamic as earlier discussed which didn't seem to make much sense and was never given any satisfactory explanation.Pivoting from the overly convoluted and confusing plot I was hoping for excellent Matrix level action and special effects. They even were joking about it within the context of the film in a very meta moment as they strived to figure out what the next ""bullet time"" was going to be. The funny part is this movie never really attains their next 'bullet time' thing thus there is no new awesome visual whatever to capture the imagination and get us to truly enjoy the visual product they put on the screen. There is nothing in the fights, action sequences or special effects that is great, grand or next level which is a disappointment. I thought this ultimately hewed too close to just trying to redo/reset the Matrix and its mythology rather than forging a bold new chapter of the Matrix so for me while they did add some interesting concepts it is an overall misstep.Eric's Grade: C-",4
2609,"I honestly think people don't understand this movie. It's not attempting to rekindle what happened in the original. The original did something that no other movie can live up to. This is a movie that it seems neither the original director nor the actors really wanted to do, but were basically forced to do, and decided to have fun with it. I actually liked it, for the allegory that it is. And think it was relatively well done. Stop watching movies for what you want them to be, and see them for what they are. I think over time this movie will grow on people.",8
2610,"Studio: Nostalgia is in. Let's reboot The Matrix.Wachowski's: No.Studio: C'mon, it will be fun! We'll fill it with superhero levels of cringey dialog, lame choreography, abysmal special effects, and boring, difficult to follow action sequences.Wachowski's: No.Studio: Are you sure? Philosophy majors dig your work...Wachowski's: No.Studio: You don't understand. We're doing this with or without you.Lana: If that's how you want it, fine. Allow me. Just leave my sister out of it.*Proceeds to hilariously shame Hollywood, the idea of franchise sequels, and purposely damage the legacy of the franchise*Lana: This was great! Let's create a Matrix Cinematic Universe (MCU).Studio: No thanks. We're rebooting Shrek.",3
2611,"So right off the bat I was concerned when I saw the first trailer and we see Morpheus is back only it is not Morpheus. I won't spoil why that is in the story but in terms of why that really is I have no doubt the real reason is that a lot of the original cast like Laurence Fishburne or any of the other original cast read the script and were like ""hard pass"" or Lana didn't even approach them knowing what she was planning to do with the film.Only Keanu and Carrie are back and I have a strong suspicion this is because they are in a profit share contract from the trilogy and thus as a trade-off for profit sharing usually is that they are then contractually obligated to do a certain or even unlimited number of sequels depending on the contract they have signed.Within the film Lana hints that Warner Brothers has in essence forced them to make this film against their will and if they were not to do it then WB would have kicked them out of their contract with WB and let someone else make Matrix 4.Lana as a big f* you to WB thus has made this film intentionally bad to destroy the franchise so WB can't milk their creation any further. It is also possible that simply by being forced to make the sequel Lana had no passion for the project and thus why it is bad. Or a combination of both of the above.The sad thing is the first hour had potential, but after that first hour it goes downhill very fast. The start of the film is in essence the peak of Mount Everest, by the end of the film you find yourself in the sewage system of an underground bunker under Mount Everest. That should say just how bad the film is.The film is 2 and a half hours long and that hour and a half of the second half of the film is just a whole load of pure nothingness. Imagine an entire film existing purely of an extended cut of the meeting between Neo and the Architect in Matrix Reloaded, well that is what the second half of this film comes across as but only worse.The action sequences are horrendous, the fight choreography is a joke, the singular car chase scene in the entire film is taken straight out of World War Z and the entire movie would fit better as a zombie movie than a Matrix film.Even the acting EVEN by Keanu Reeves is bad in this film. Though we don't get to see much of his acting anyway as Neo doesn't really do anything in this film. Does he fight? No? Does he have amazing dialogue? No he actually doesn't talk much. Does he achieve anything of note in this film? Again no, in fact you could easily cut Neo out of the entire film and the film would still work.Anyway circling around to this film being intentionally bad, well Lana Wachowski be glad with one thing you did achieve what you wanted to and namely screwed over Warner Bros and all Matrix fans in the process as well. Congratulations!",5
2612,Seen a bunch of trolls give the movie a 1/10 n clearly they do not know what a 1/10 is cause if they did they would be saving that for some movie that is filmed poorly with lets say a handheld camcorder with poor graphics that looks like its made by the first pentium computer in the world or something lol. Maybe even lines that dont make sense and no plot and no character names and no anything but maybe a cat sitting on a toilet for 2 hours lol.Now anyone to say they walked out of this movie is clearly lying cause lets be real no one will waste money to just walk out and especially for them not to know how it ends to somethin as big as Matrix is.Anyway it was confusing at first but slowly and slowly things started to add up and then it became very clear how amazing they tied the storyline up to converge with past Matrix films.Honestly it was very clever how they came about this sequel and by the end of the movie i was like very impressed at the creativity of the storyline.Now the ending couldve been better but i also liked what the ending could possibly mean if their were possible sequels. The acting was okay and certain parts seemed rush but they made due with the time they had to tie up every loose end the best they could.I feel this film may just open the door for more sequels so consider this film not as just a single film but as a possibility of opening the door to more too come. Theirs quite more stories to tell judging by everything that occurred in the film so keep an open mind when watching this and enjoy the ride into the Matrix as they brilliantly found a way to make a sequel so creatively for the plot-line.,7
2613,"Really good, way better than the reviews suggest. The ending a bit blant in fairness but all the way was top class. Like the story building, it was intriguing. Different theme than the previous movies but that's OK. Very enjoyable watch, thanks wachiwsko brothers or sisters or whatever...",10
2614,"Matrix 1 was still the best, then it degraded gradually from 2, and 3. Now Matrix 4 is the worst, a waste of time, the story line does not make any sense. Neo was supposedly to be The One, the ""Satori"" in Matrix 1, now he still seeking the truth in Matrix 4 with a bunch of nonsense fighting scene from start to finish. The movie looks cheap, childish and more like a kid game. Definitely not recommended. The one who acquired satori means he is above the matrix, above love, he is the manipulator of the Oracle, of 0 and 1. Love drowns people not save them. They make a movie that they don't understand of what they dealing with.",1
2615,"Love the movie, it is not going to work for general movie goers, or even sci fi lovers. This movie is for Wachowski's fans. I loved to see Neo and Trinity back and movie was a great fun ride. The romantic track was very believable. The storyline was good and action was good. Bug was a highlight for me. She did such a good job. I will revisit this movie, and am so glad it was made. This movie is for Matrix trilogy fans. Sucks Laurance was not there but we see a lot of him in ""throwbacks"". My rating will be 7.8 giving it 10 so it can get some boost in score, coz I want Matrix 5 to be made.",10
2616,"Total disgrace to the original trilogy. Pathetic flashbacks of phrases, scenes and characters. Lana had no business in solo producing this pathetic movie. Must need more money for the operations. Damn you. Thank God I have a short memory when needed.",2
2617,"Horrible acting, plot, screenplay and everything else... and those are the good points. If you have any love of the original... stay away or you will be poisoned. Another induced casualty of the new Holly-weird and talent-less. I will continue with my new-found love of classic movies.",1
2618,"I thought I was going to get The Matrix 4. Instead what I got is The Matrix: A Spoof Movie. I'm not being critical, that's literally what it is, that's what happens in the movie - it makes fun of the previous movies on purpose. There's literally a moment where one of the characters mentions having their own spin-off franchise sequel. It was cringeworthy.It tried to be clever but failed in a big way.I just wish the marketing of The Matrix 4 made that clear, that it's a spoof movie, which it didn't. We were sold something we didn't pay for.This is ""Scary Movie"", ""Not another teen movie"" etc, The Matrix version.",2
2619,"It felt like a B grade remake of Matrix, utterly disappointing!!! They could have made a legendary movie with FX tech of 2021 but they managed to ruin it.",4
2620,"Well, where to start. I grew up watching the matrix during my teens. This movie is just not original.Also what made keanu do this is beyond, he should have just made a sequel to Constantine.",3
2621,"Keanu said he signed up because it's a story that has to be said.Movie is ""nice"" but it doesn't ""say"" anything.Why do Neo and Trinity have control over the Matrix in the end? Nothing about their ""anomaly"" presumes absolute control.Why does the Analyst have ""control with bullet time"" and somehow Neo escapes/does whatever he wants?Why could Smith go beyond the Analyst?Why does Morpheus-program work in reality but Smith doesn't?Why does Morpheus-magnet-reality-program go through forcefields?The fight scenes are dull. The dialogue and scenes are heavily drawn from the original trilogy. The ""original"" dialogue is very dull.The CG in reality was nice so points for that.",3
2622,"Cinema - 4DX ViewingLike many of you, I grew up with the Matrix and rightfully watched the original take its place as a film that changed the action and Sci-Fi genre forever.In recent years I watched the 20th anniversary screening of the original Matrix movie and this year I rewatched both Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions. It gave me an opportunity to take a deep dive into trilogy and really understand the heart and theme of the originals. This involved deep line for line breakdowns of lines from key characters such as The Oracle, The Architect and Agent Smith amongst others. Therefore I came to appreciate the wider themes and meanings in the sequels as much as the action.On the back this I set realistic expectations for Matrix Resurrections. I wasn't expecting new ground breaking action but given the direction the sequels took I assumed there would bd some deep and/or intersting themes explored. Maybe something left field that might split the the fan base 50/50 or require a careful exploration of dialogue and actions.Unfortunately Matrix Ressurections did not manage to do this. The 4th instalment doesn't throw up much new and anything that is new doesn't appear to be particularly savvy, enjoyable or earned. You'll only revisit the film to confirm explanations were as strange and/or basic as you first thought. For example, explanations as to why certain characters have returned.One thing I did not expect was the Matrix to turn into a series that went out of its way to self parody itself but maybe I should not be surprised after having seen Space Jam 2.The films kicks off 20 years after Matrix Revolutions with Keanu Reeves playing a programmer, Mr Anderson, who has developed three blockbuster Matrix Games (The first 3 movies which he sees in his dreams). I could have just dealt with this but the meta goes further when Mr Anderson wants to make a new game but WB want him to make 4th Matrix instead. I won't go any further as this is a non spoiler review but you get my point...I feel sorry for Actors Yahya Abdul Mateen and Jonathan Geoff who play the roles of 'Morpheus' and 'Agent Smith' in the current I instalment. It's not that they personally did a bad job but it's almost impossible to step into those roles and its made all the more difficult given the overall movie package. Moreover their are constant flash backs to the original trilogy.It's like watching the Last Jedi where a new actor plays Luke Skywalker and every time they did something strange with Luke, they decided to flash back to one of the iconic Mark Hamill scenes from the original. It isn't fair!The action was ok but given how film making has moved on it was unlikely to be anything ground breaking. Again, instead of having confidence to do the basics really well or coming up with something fresh the film tried to relay on outdated ideas or basic ideas performed poorly.I'm disappointed in this sequel and therefore cannot recommend it. Im glad those of you across the pond did not have to make the journey to the cinema for this one.I'm very disappointed in this sequel and therefore cannot recommend it. The 4DX experience was cool but it could not redeem the movie.",5
2623,"Not a perfect film, a half hour could be trimmed and still should be. Like Rocky films, I needed this to remind me I'm not alone in my thinking, and to stand up and keep fighting. The film goes deep which will lose the fans primarily interested in action. The clever parts make it all worthwhile.",10
2624,"Obviously not the greatest cinematic endeavour to be put on screen. Not even close to being one of the best sequels, although objectively better that 2 or 3, this movie is about something else than rekindling the spark Matric 1999 gave us.That this movie does is to take us for a ride down memory lane, revisit all the things we liked, loved and hated about the trilogy and shoehorn all that stuff into what it should have been from the start. A happy ending fairytale!Next to the injustice that was done to the audience in Matrix 2 and 3, the second greatest injustice was the cruel and pointless happenstance and ending of the main characters and their relationship. This movie remedies that crime.That and a bit of fan service is all it does, but that is what we have to be content with. It works and it wraps things up in an fat better way than things were left after 3.A solid 7 for having the guts to right some narrative wrongs. Not high art but not rubbish either.",7
2625,It's just a commercial movie. I didn't like this movie and don't recommend it. The comic scenes are totally boring. They ruined a whole well-finished work just out of greed.,5
2626,"I think I've only done this twice - walk out of the cinema because the film is such nonsense, such a waste of my time that I wouldn't entertain a single moment more to lose watching it. A parody, a mockery, a.... You get it.Clip show? Member berries? Same stuff different day? What is the point of acting out the exact same scenes (poorly) with the backdrop of the previous trilogy? Was there not enough budget to remove the TV-show quality slow motion suggested to carry confusion in the protagonist...Do yourself a favor don't waste your time.",1
2627,"I've been looking forward to this movie for years and years. I loved the 1st one (who didn't), the 2nd one was crap, and the 3rd was ok-ish. But this latest is what they came up with? It's PAINFUL to watch. It' an absolute mess. Disjointed action scenes, empty acting, non-relatable characters, and woke BS wasting another good franchise.Please don't waste your money on this one.",
2628,"I suppose if I were a gamer I would have probably enjoyed this movie since there was plenty of action but then again, maybe not. It's a long movie and constant fighting just gets boring. Besides, if you're into the martial arts you know that these choreographed fight scenes are more like dancing than anything related to real self-defense. Because I like Keanu I gave the movie a 2 but that's the only reason. Stay home... read a good book.",2
2629,"There are downsides, but overall the film is good. It is necessary to consider this film in the context of modern history and modern cinema. You don't have to expect the movie to be the same. Many have become victims of their own expectations. The film is worthy of attention.",10
2630,"The Matrix Resurrection is the latest blockbuster lean on nostalgia. But instead appears only for the sake of nostalgia itself, the film dares to challenge and twist the narrative and continuously make it fresh. Not as groundbreaking as the original, but still giving you a fun ride at the big screen.Too bad there are too many expositions and it's a little bit annoying. The film is also a bit lacking in the action department, especially since the great Yuen Woo-ping isn't involved anymore.Jessica Henwick is a revelation.",7
2631,"The matrix is iconic. Intuition is telling me that this movie is a response to the love the people behind know we have for the story, an epic story that I'm so glad I got to have more of! This visuals and effects are amazing, and the plot is literally a message to me that choices really are just our minds providing comfort and that we are in control of our own realities. Where people have taken the blue pill is that they compare what's happening now to what happened then. This is not another sequel to hate on, this is a thank you for the love from the people that created this for us. Ima go me yourself in this movie and you'll enjoy it. Or you'll take the blue pill and you won't.",10
2632,How the hell did this get greenlightedwe were missing a wakowski brother/sister and you can tell that this isn't even half as good as revolutionsive seen hallmark movies of the week that were better than this.Shame on everyone who particiapted in this movie.,1
2633,"Ah yes, The Matrix, one of the best and most influential sci-fi films of recent decades and one of my all-time favourite films. When it was announced that another sequel is coming, I was mostly indifferent about it because that is just Hollywood now, anything can be brought back. When the first full trailer dropped for The Matrix Resurrections, it piqued my interest a bit but I didn't get hyped or had high hopes even if some of the original cast is returning as well as one of the creators i.e Lana Wachowski because, in this day and age, it is more likely to be a letdown. And as it turns out, that was precisely the case. This is, without a doubt, the worst movie in the franchise. BUT I was pleasantly surprised that after seeing the negative reception from a lot of people it wasn't an outright terrible experience for me and I ended up enjoying several parts of it even if I wouldn't call the movie good but rather a middling to above-average experience owing to my predisposition and fanboy bias towards this world.Returning to the world of The Matrix after more than 20 years certainly carried a hefty dose of nostalgia and it was plainly enjoyable simply being thrust back into that realm. Seeing Keanu Reeves as Neo again lit up the fan in me. Having to deal with the matrix again and retreading events from the first one, despite being an obvious nostalgia bait, was entertaining especially when the movie was self-aware about it and had a meta-narrative going on. In fact, the time spent in the matrix during the first half was probably my favourite, especially when you view it from the machines or The Analyst's POV.It would have been wonderful to have Laurence Fishburn and Hugo Weaving reprising their roles but the replacement for Morpheus, Yahya Adul-Mateen II, wasn't bad. Felt like a hip version of Morpheus. Can't say the same for the new Agent Smith but he did bring some unintentional hilarity, so there's that. In fact, there was a lot of comedy relative to the previous parts, both intentional and unintentional. Some of it worked, a lot of it didn't with some scenes being pure cringe as was the case with a certain cameo.You get a new crew of characters but apart from Jessica Henwick's character Bugs, none of them were interesting or had any proper presence. The only connection I felt was that several of the actors were from Sense8, a series I happen to like. The performances were fine, including Neil Patrick Harris and Carrie-Anne Moss returning as Trinity.The second half of the movie deals more with the real world and at first, I was enjoying seeing how things have developed after Revolutions. There were intriguing tidbits and scarce info dumps as well as developments which I liked and I was wishing the movie would explore more but it was busy rushing on with its own clunky main plot. Maybe they are saving it for further sequels which I'm not sure they'll even get a greenlit on. To make matters worse, the movie, regrettably, leaned too heavily on the nostalgia baiting and dangling keychains instead of balancing it out. It was spread out throughout the runtime with the most egregious one being flashbacks of scenes from the previous movies which acted as a constant reminder that while you're back in this world, it's nowhere near as well-executed, a self-inflicted detrimental element.The element that actually disappointed me the most was the audiovisual experience, something I expected we would at least get in a strong manner even if all else fails. The action, while being fine-ish for a modern Hollywood big-budget movie, was way too poorly executed in comparison to the previous films. The trilogy was known for its Martial Arts and Gun action and you hardly get anything of the former while a flimsy toned down version of the latter with stormtrooper aim dialled up the highest level as if the operator has hacked the matrix and is purposely making the bad guys miss every shot. The biggest sin was having the now John Wick at your disposal and not giving him a gun throughout the movie or having any scene with Neo going all out and instead relegating him mostly to force push and pull. There was also no real tension or actual danger/threat in the movie.All in all, this was a clunky and messily executed amalgamation of some cool ideas and concepts, new and old, and a trip down memory lane which kept it from diving into the abyss further propelled a bit by my inner fan bias of this world. By no means a good movie and after pondering upon it for a while, I can certainly see where the hate is coming from. If you're a massive fan of the trilogy, you might enjoy it but if you only like/love the first one and didn't enjoy the sequels, chances are this won't bring your mind around. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 6/10.",6
2634,"I really enjoyed the first 3 movies in the franchise, but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The first hour starts off ok, but as soon as they release Trinity, it goes down hill in a hurry. Makes zero sense and if you watch after the credits it sums up the atrocity of this movie with: ""The Catrix"".",1
2635,"I booked my ticket well in advance at the nicest cinema an hours drive away for opening night, worth it for a movie that has been such a cornerstone of my life in so many ways. The last time i saw a movie on its opening night was Star Wars Episode II, likewise at the best cinema to fully soak up the experience.. so me and a handful of my friends at the age of 15 or so got the permission of our parents and caught a train at night 40min away and walked several blocks at night feeling quite proud of our new found independence and at the cinema the vibe was alive! There were people in all kinds of Star Wars outfits and everything was so incredible. My experience at the Matrix Resurrection opening night tonight was quite the opposite.. it was mostly middle aged people, quiet, averting eye contact, no conversation, no excitement in the air..I'm 34 now, not a teenager, i don't need costumes and hype, just a good movie made by real artists which plugs into the backbone of our humanity implanting us with deep life altering food for thought that will continue feeding us with said food for decades to come whilst we digest.Being 13 yrs old when i saw and fell in love with the first Matrix film in 99, already feeling so grown up at that point from facing what i thought where harsh realities of our world, but unknowingly a stage of my life I'd look back on for decades to follow as a time far simpler, when i comparatively had my life more together and far far more to loose than i do now. Its hard not to be faced with these memories as i re-immurse into this story without experiencing a sense of loss.. loss of family, friends, health, the place i grew up, the people i grew up with, my innocence and my youth.. i can't get these back, having done everything the best i can as righteously and ethically as i can I'm a lone wolf now just battling my way through a life that doesn't seem fair or to have a very bright end, certainly devoid of any love or connection.All that personal stuff helped me relate to Neo in Resurrection. Heck I've always related to Neo.. in 2006 i earned a green belt in Kempo after years training and black belt in Karate 2010 greatly inspired by The Matrix and The Karate Kid. After 2010 I've been in sylvatical mode.. silent peaceful warrior introspective monk mode.. with moments of real weakness and moments of incredible strength and sacrifice, and creativity has always been the bread and butter throughout. Knowing and seeking deep truths of our reality and been chastised and further alienated everytime I've tried to do anything good about it. In 2019 after 9yrs abstinent i had enough of trying to fight the good fights so i started metaphorically taking the blue bill, trying to indulge in a bit of blissful iggnorance, but 2021 comes along and has other plans. ""See the choice is an illusion when you know what you have to do"". This year I'm taking steps to reclaim my strength and not give up on love, next year I'll continue that mission and I'm learning a new martial art Jiu-jitsu which i hope will help give me a less binary approach on the world.As for the movie itself.. look it was brilliant, there's no denying that. I loved how it brought in more familiar elements from the animatrix, i loved how Neo is weaker than his former self but not when it comes to love, i love the direction the story took and there being a bit more graphic content like when you see Neo being dissected by the machines, i love the new (and old) characters, however i felt they could have talked more clearly especially at the start of the movie they're mumbling and talking too fast.I wished the choreography would have improved after all this time but it was much the same as it always has been with the previous three (think crouching tiger), there were some cool techniques executed but overall the fight scenes were average along with a shaky cam to worsen it further, especially considering their abilities are meant to be superhuman effectively.. you'd do better to watch John Wick or Marvel's The Punisher if you like real martial arts and considering Reeves had put so much work in for his John Wick character I'd really hoped for some of that realism to spill over into this new Matrix film, but it really didn't sadly, so for a character that ""still knows Kung Fu"" lol, well he demonstrates very little. So fight scenes and scattish scenes reminiscent of Inception aside, I'm in it for the story and like i said, it delivered, but not without a few unanswered questions here and there.So it's an 8/10 from a huge fan of The Matrix. Im not at all disappointed, but not really amazed either, just kind of integrating and digesting, unable to sleep at this point from drinking too much caffeine in the theatre lol.Good work Lana and Crew. Just please get another fight scene choreographer in future 🙏",8
2636,"I hate to be the old man screaming into the void, but just like the new Spider-man; the story is forced and the characters are forced. Bringing back characters with terrible story lines just isn't doing it for me. So many holes and just a reach. Should of took the Blue pill and went to ""Sing 2"".",2
2637,"Young crew with bad actingToo much look back and ""Quotes"", it tries so hard to be what it's not.80 years grannies fist bumping with 20year old ship captainsNeo's bullet time is badly doneStory line is confusing.Reaves get worse and more wooden as an actor the older he gets.Smith is awful, couldn't they afford to get a true cross over with smith, even if the original actors pay was a high ask.Why does all the young cast have to look like the old cast?I'm sorry but it just feels like a direct to DVD release movie with a crap director and low paid actors and only 2 names in the industry holding it up and 1 being a wooden bad actor that sucked as Bill &amp; Ted and sucked at John Wick and not Sucks at being Neo.Don't waste your money, watch on Tor.. well you get i it. Or wait till it comes on the streaming service of your choice.",5
2638,"OK, I'll be honest...this film has its fair share of flaws, as did the last 2 attempts at continuing the Matrix story. But, I feel that this latest installment is worth checking out to revisit a classic world. For me, the first half of the film is 8/10 material with so many interesting/cool ideas, but...like with the other Matrix sequels, it gets bogged down later with exposition and over-explaination that it takes away from what was setup so expertly in the beginning. This would make the second half more of a 6/10 for me...with the action being a little stale and not as impressive as previous installments. Overall, I really enjoyed it!! Far more than I thought I would! 7/10 overall for me! Eager to see what comes next for the Matrix...",7
2639,"Oh no! Please!This is something a lot of us waited since they announced it. And knowing it was been directed by Wachowski was a good sign.This is totally a mess. The story feels like ""hey! We have the money, the green light, lets make something up quick"".NO story, NO acting, NO dialogue, NO action, NO new stuff, NO, NO, NO.Boring, predictable, annoying.Waste of money (from the producers), waste of time (producers and audience).Hopefully they don´t get back what spent and avoid another one.",3
2640,"Keanu Reeves was absolutely right this movie is so ahead of its time that people will understand it ten years from now. I can understand the negative reviews because this film brings you a mirror in front of you where it shows you what you do not want to see and face, it undresses our time and shows you a reality that no one wants to face as the road is long for to come out of your oblivion. People at that moment can only consume amusement park movies as well as anything related to their life.This is what the first film did, only then people were more ready to understand what the film showed them.",10
2641,"First of all it wasn't that bad as most reviews are saying.But honestly the whole movie and moral story can be summarized in the couple of monologs of The Merovingian (from the second movie - yes he's back) and the Analyst - i.e. The Architect of the Matrix 2.0.And the moral is that the Matrix 2.0 - i.e. Our nowadays world is way worse place than the one 20 years ago when the first movie came out - we are willingly selling our imaginary ""freedom"" for even more imaginary ""safety"".Watch it and you'll see.",7
2642,"Totally pointless plot and horribly written script. Acting is pretty much terrible and the editing tosses the whole mess in the gutter and lights it on fire.How this train wreck made it off the editing table is completely insane. It makes multiple attempts to masquerade as intelligent and witty, but falls flat over and over. Kept asking myself what the hell were they thinking at every turn. At just shy of 2.5 hours it was painful to watch.Literally takes a giant dump on the original.2/10.",2
2643,"I watched the three previous movies and this one connects all of them, recognizing the power of love as the most powerful creative force of the universe and proposing a society where divisions are beginning to fall apart and machines and humans are finding a way to live together. Evolution.War and oppression are still there for the sake of the story, but the main bet of the director seems to be showing that stories may be the same ones, repeatedly during centuries, in multiple bodies, buy only love can create new opportunities and reset us all.It's more than a romantic idea, it's a truth. And it had to be a risky Wachowsky director the one who decided to create a revolutionary story like this one, even as we expected more bullets and special effects. But we asked them to go beyond. And even if many don't get it, that's really it: going beyond the already expected story.",9
2644,"I loved it.The music was perfect, and there were so many gorgeous moments that caught your breath, and held your heart.If you truly loved the first three, I can't see how you could hate this one...Sure, it was a bit Hollywood with a happy ending etc, but honestly, it was the dozens of moments that made me love it so much!Definitely going to see it again and again!Would have been super cool to have the original Morpheus and Agent Smith though...",10
2645,"God knows what all the bad reviews are for?? Its really good! All gets explained well, couple of goosebump moments and I even shouted out at one point, what more do you want lol. So shocked by bad reviews that it feels like a campaign by rival film company to discredit the film.",10
2646,"Unlike many other viewers, I did not find it to be slow or disappointing, story wise.There are a lot of interesting developments in the current movie. In some places there are even hints of trying to blend our own reality (including the actors') with the narrative of the movie.The new line of control envisaged in the movie may appear crass or cliched but is very real and subtle ... so much so that it has even Agent Smith hooked (!)The only thing I found missing was gravitas in the acting. Trinity and Neo look a bit tired, unfortunately. The background score could have been a bit more inspiring. And the new Morpheus just doesn't make the cut in my view.I wish they had put more action from Agent Smith in the movie. The actors who play that role typically tend to play it well for some reason.",8
2647,It is indisputable that Keanu Reeves is a fantastic actor with an illustrious career. Unfortunately this movie is a massive fail. It feels like the supporting cast was ordered straight from Wish. A truly terrible movie on so many levels. A confused mess that is a stain on this otherwise fantastic franchise. I've never wanted a movie to end so badly.Do yourself and your wallet a favour and skip this film.,1
2648,Unfortunately the trailer is the only thing good about this film &amp; I'm one of the biggest matrix heads you'll ever come across!! So sad to have just witnessed such trash. Can't say I'm surprised with what's been coming out these days and the fact that it went straight to hbo max speaks volumes! An insult to the original matrix film.,5
2649,"We all knew the transformative era-defining magic of the first Matrix movie couldn't be repeated. We knew this in part because the Wachowskis tried, and failed with the 2nd and 3rd instalments respectively. 'Fun' as they were they weren't anywhere near the level of the first one - a film so iconic and so embedded in our popculture that rewatching it more than 20 years later during quarantine me and my friends were compelled to scream out at the sheer coolness of almost every scene. But this review isn't about the original Matrix. This is about the reheated, reanimated corpse of a once original idea.To be fair with everyone getting older, Lilly dropping out mid-production, and pandemic forced delays expectations had to be railed in as it was. I've seen the trailer; I knew this would look different and was still looking forward to it.Alas, it was not be. Resurrections starts out bland, peaks twenty minutes in with a fairly promising montage and then falls into complete incoherency as the movie progresses. Although not earth shattering or conceptually nearly as grandiose as the first film, the meta sendup of corporate media culture Lana flirts with in the first quarter could've been a very interesting angle and could've justified the sequel's existence. It is after all the doubts that first arise when a studio returns to a wildly successful idea decades later. Is there any new thought here? Can you manufacture creativity? Can a profit driven sequel retain any of the soul of the original? How interesting it would've been to take this contradiction apart within the multi-dimensions of the Matrix where nothing is ever real and when life feels too fake to be benign it actually turns out to be so! One wonders where along the film's development was this effort squashed? Because Resurrections if nothing else, is a film that prophesies its own demise - the first quarter portending seemingly without a modicum of irony or self-awareness what happens in the remaining three fourths of the runtime. Too much focus on the action? Check. Overusing once-cool ideas, like bullet-time? Check. Incomprehensible, but complex sounding plotlines explained during tedious and overlong exposition monologues? Check.As it stands an investigative documentary about what went wrong during development sounds far more enticing than anything this film could offer. When did the suits take over? Who decided to deliver the bare minimum and hope the masses whose palettes have been sufficiently dulled by the franchise factory would pretend not to notice? And mid-film at that! Was Lilly perhaps not party to this watering down of the original idea. Or was the media criticism merely added after development started as a cynical attempt to bring overly critical audience members on board? Whatever it was, we're left with one cool sequence in an otherwise completely blend film featuring some great actors, and the task of trying to erase another Matrix film from our memory to preserve the heritage of the original. At least this last part shouldn't present an issue; with Reloaded and Revolutions we already have some experience there.",3
2650,"The whole movie feels incomplete and wrecked. They tried to mix up different things into one entity and they failed. Solid 90-s ideas plus romcom plus somewhat of a watch dogs:legion style plus a superhero movie features plus nostalgia plus who knows what else.Keanu and Carrie-Ann look as weird among all those kids as 'Agent Smith' and 'Morpheus' look completely ridiculous in smart casual.All these overdramatized moments, all those gags are just so out of place and inappropriate.Machines helping people - why? Programs in 'real world' - why???Perhaps we have to read between the lines and perhaps the movie really happened just because WB wanted it to happen (as mentioned in the movie itself).",1
2651,"There was sooo much feminism in this movie I thought I was watching another Disney Star Wars sequel. Especially in the end when Trinity was the one who could fly. Sick of all the ""tough girl"" movie plots.",5
2652,"I know that everyone dislikes this film, and that is somehow stoled the script from the first matrix movie. But it may been a misunderstanding. The movie not only is great, but it also explains somethings. For example, it explains how Neo and Trinity survived after matrix 3 and it showing on screen. Also we can see them both in the trailer. I know that the humor of the film isn't good for a matrix movie but honestly, it didn't bother me. I know that the recast of Morpheus and Smith's role were a bad idea and maybe is the only flawed thing of the movie. But in otherwise, it's really great to have the matrix back.",9
2653,"A rich universe full of possibilities to be explored, such as how and why Neo managed to stop those sentries ""outside"" of the Matrix, or maybe something about the chosen loop.The love story was already there in the previous ones and it can't be bigger than the universe by itself. I love Lana and her ideas, but it's no longer worthy of the rights to this franchise. In the 90s, The Matrix was a nerd breath, for us, at a time with little access to information, we consumed everything, Animatrix, magazines and everything that spoke about this universe.This review of mine isn't technical, it's not based on professionalism, it's purely about how sad I was when I left the theater.",3
2654,"A large portion of The Matrix Resurrections is about digging into the memories of not only Thomas Anderson but the audience who watched these movies 20 years ago. While the flirtation with nostalgia is interesting, the commentary on the entertainment industry in general is a little too obvious for a world that is already elbows deep within it.The core of this movie is what really matters and that's Neo and Trinity. The progression of their story makes absolute sense when taking the entire franchise into context and ultimately gives us a Matrix movie that is far more personal than we've had before. They are not pushed aside to prop up newer characters and when I walked out of the theater I was not thinking about the action or special effects but instead the beautiful relationship between two human beings that reminds us what true love is all about.",7
2655,I had no expectations of this movie and I should admit they've done a pretty good job with continuing the story they told us before while creating a new Matrix. I actually liked it a lot!If you expect to see the same Matrix it will disappoint you. I can understand some of the critics but I also see why they've done some of the things some people don't like. Overall the pieces have come together beautifully. Comparing to the movies we see nowadays I think this by far is much better.,10
2656,No seriously... where's the iconic Matrix action??It's 2021 and there was better cgi action in 1999!This feels more of a knock off than an actual movie inspired from the concepts of the previous films.Much disappointment.,6
2657,"There are TV series with way better staged, produced, edited, choreographed scenes than this. Saying this is part of Matrix ""franchise"" (the only one that is really good is the 1st) like saying ""Scary Movie"" is part of ""Scream"" film/franchise. Like a parody of itself with a heist and a love story. Lots of fan-services without any new material. Tell me about trying to squeeze more milk from a dried up cash cow (""and I thought the 2nd and 3rd were bad"").Thomas Anderson (John Wick cosplaying as a washed up Neo) is a game designer now, Matrix is a videogame of his ~how thoughtful~ so they keep citing and paraphrasing most of the lines from the previous films non-stop ""without copying themselves"" *cough* (imagine if a good movie did that!?, it doesn't need to because there is a story line to sustain itself to stand apart from the others or resume from where it stopped). The first hour of it is just faded photocopy with little sprinkles around and just like that it loses its original colors/contexts/contents.New characters were added but to no real identity to differentiate themselves from anybody previous (just empty NPC hanging around without any goal at all), no discerning characteristics, just copying and re-saying same lines imitating previous characters - if this was intended, they could actually try to put a story that it was a reset or something, but no. A new oracle-look-alike, a kind of ""Morpheus Jr."", Niobe as an old grumpy lady (who now worries more about vegetables/gardening/botanic instead of trying to help human beings enslaved in the Matrix), a ""new Niobe"" (that blue-haired-chick) and the rest is there because a ""ship"" needs a crew and that's it. No thoughtful lines for the crew members at all (like Tank said something in the first one, like Cypher said about the ignorance being a bliss, nothing).""Morpheus Jr."" keeps offering red pills like a guy who is looking to offer some drugs in night clubs every where (don't even trying to hide it or make it a seemingly important choice a character has to make). Keeps citing the original constantly to me was getting the parody levels up to the max.The heist part is thrown out of nowhere without any construction/climbing for it (just like the mingled former films' scenes into it) - without any explanations/climbing to it, it is just there and gone as it was put there with no fore-thought. (Note: in the first one, a heist is made with the goal of set Morpheus free from the Agents and that was a time constraint imperative that were built up to it.)The love story is, as was subtle underlined since the 1st one (but made into integral part of a overall plot - Cinderella style at the end but it fitted the job) but served a purpose in the 1st movie, in this one is just ""we gotta do because we gotta do"" with no object other than Neo wants his wife back and now she flies, because they said so (something only 1 person did in the previous 3 movies, and that what they were looking for Neo all around) which got me thinking that if ""everybody is special, nobody is special"" (""superpowers"" or whatever, if now both are the one. Why it didn't manifested in the previous ones!?). If Neo is not ""the One"" anymore, so it is not special anymore, it is spread between 2 now. And the last straw for me was the ""couples' therapy discussion"" there... c'mon... be more creative, ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"" ending!? Give us a break.Conclusion: it gave me a feeling that it was something rushed by exec.s to be done ""yesterday"" to try to milk a dried up cash cow. Everything thrown without ""glue"" (subtexts or any depth to it).",1
2658,Thank God I didn't pay to watch this. It not only was terrible but destroyed the previous Trilogy from my must see movie collection. Keanu needs to get over the John Wick fetish. The story has no point but to destroy its predecessors. There's so much that could have been done with better creativity.,1
2659,"I love the first two episodes. A bit disappointed by the third one. But this... this makes me want to go back in time and pull my eyes out before watching the first five minutes.It is some kind of weird masochism - I stop it each time after five minutes and then again I'm curious if that can go even more absurd. And it does or at least keeps at the same level for some time.Just made for moneymaking, there is nothing for someone that loves real cinema.",1
2660,The storyline was poor. If they wanted to resurrect the Matrix maybe they should have done an origin story as to why humans were in the Matrix in the first place. Could have been salvaged if Lawrence Fishbourne and Hugo Weaving were there in their original roles. This time around Neil Patrick Harris was my favorite. I couldn't connect with any of these new characters or any of the old ones...as much as I love Keanu.,3
2661,"Why do a reboot like this if you don't have a good story to tell or a great idea?It felt like nothing but a reach for your wallet for nostalgia's sake, if it were not for the hefty $190 million budget.Worst of all, it was terrible, with fight scenes so amateur looking it would be more at home on NCIS or a soap opera and a bland cast of forgettable actors . Slow mo (the lame kind!), and constant switching of camera angles to hide poorly choreographed fight scenes just ruined it. It's like they remade the matrix but stripped out everything cool, stylish or great about it.For the movies budget it came off like a low budget movie. How far the Apple has fallen from the tree :0(",3
2662,"This movie is hilariously bad and a low effort cash grab on a popular franchise. The Matrix franchise is known for its groundbreaking cinematography and effects but this new film feels like a cheap made for tv episode. The story is really dumb and is filed with a bunch of exposition that doesn't matter. There was obviously no passion put into this project. When compared to recent science fiction/ action films (Black Mirror, John Wick) this film falls extremely short.",1
2663,"Not a matrix film as far as I'm concerned, it's just awful and that's being kind. I would recommend staying as far away from this movie if you value the original trilogy, this film does nothing creative and made me wish the ending would come every 2 mins, I've never left a movie theatre more disappointed in my life, this is quite possibly one of the worst films I've ever watched in my life.",1
2664,This movie sucked.It totally destroyed everything about the original trilogy.Changed the actors. Where is Hugo Weaving? Where is Lawrence Fishburne?It's just a horrible mess.,3
2665,"If you're looking for tips on how to ruin a franchise then this movie holds all the answers. Boring and pointless.I'm not quite sure why anyone at a studio would green light this lacking and dull script. Pathetic is a strong word, too strong? Nope. This was a pathetic attempt at ""resurrecting"" Neo and Trinity.If you have any taste in decent movies then Avoid this pet project like the plague unless you need to catch up on some rest. You can sleep through this garbage festival pretty easily.If Lana W ever directs another movie I will be sure to save my money and my time. What a waste.",1
2666,"This script, story, and movie are an absolute jumbled mess, It was so forced. I can't believe how bad everything was. The whole opening scene you can just tell they are on a movie set. The directing was god awful. But, yeah, that script/story.... So stupid (that attempt at comedy in the beginning, facepalm). What a shame.",2
2667,"The Matrix Resurrections is more of The Matrix storyline, but I'm still not sure if that's a good or bad thing. Like a lot of people, I never even liked the other 2 sequels as much as the original, so I wasn't expecting much out of the follow up almost 20 years later.Having seen the first movie in theatres, it was everything this and the sequels are not: groundbreaking visually, filled with tightly-shot and we'll choreographed action, and a story with themes, ideas, and concepts that were practically universally understood.Take all of that away and replace it with more tepid fight scenes, antagonists that at some points don't feel like antagonists, and a story without as much on the line (so it seems), and you have The Matrix Resurrections. So why does that warrant a 6 out of 10 instead of a lower score?Because the movie is still visually stunning, Jessica Henwick is a great addition to the cast, and there's some interesting concepts introduced that play with ideas established in the other movies. Keanu turns in a great performance here, and it's also really nice to see Carrie-Ann Moss again, who has always been a tremendous actress.There's clearly still some cleverness in the script which prevents it from feeling totally hollow, but overall in the context of the story, I can't really put my finger on why the events of the story took place, and what it is that Neo&amp;Trinity want to accomplish at the end.I didn't at any point totally understand the motivations of The Analyst, the new master of this version of The Matrix, and the new version of Agent Smith was inconsistently written too, at least to what I understood, even though Jonathan Groff is a great actor. It just seems like they each want...more Matrix, I guess? For the simulation to keep running efficiently?There's nothing wrong with a love story, but the original Matrix and even the sequels had so much more on the line than that, and this installment just didn't capture the danger and urgency of especially the original movie.The heavy exposition-laden dialogue scenes that were so much of why the sequels weren't as good make a comeback here. The original didn't have the rambling monologues that we saw from The Architect and other characters in the sequels. Everything was shown to us, and if there were monologues in the first film, it meant something, like when Smith is talking to Morpheus when he's captured. Resurrections can't seem to manage to tell the story without the use of these scenes.The meta-commentary in the movie is fun and sometimes clever, but just because there's characters in the movie that talk about unnecessary sequels being unnecessary...doesn't make this not unnecessary. The meta nature of the movie leads to us revisiting slightly altered versions of scenes we've seen before...but..they're ultimately still concepts we've seen before, so that's not a way around that.That's the tricky thing about meta-content in media, and the self-awareness Resurrections has doesn't make it a good story on its own.If you've seen the other Matrix films and enjoy them, I would give this a look if you're curious, but if you're not a diehard Matrix fan, you don't need to go through this Resurrection.",6
2668,"I'll be as pithy as offended I am.They not only produced a terrible movie, they tried their best to vilify the original classic.It makes you think what has happened to a normal person's approach. It also makes you think what happened to the classic storytelling and storytellers.I just wasted two-and-a-half hours of my life watching this farce. It was like watching porn: poor acting, fake emotions, cheap cast, terrible screenplay, lousy action, meaningless outcome.",1
2669,"Awful.I caught the first wide release showing in the UK. It was a dreadfully dull film; I closed my eyes hoping to sleep through the multiple long scenes of directionless pointless dialogue.The worst aspect of this movie however is the utter lack of conflict. It's never explained why it's important to the humans in the real world that Neo needs to escape the Matrix, or Trinity for that matter, other than, 'Oh, they're legends.'Very sloppy, lazy writing, and the fight scenes were laughably bad. If you watch the film, compare the fight between Neo and 'Smith' with the fight in the first film in the subway station, and you'll know what I mean.I've given it a '3' for good special effects in places, but the story should always, always be central in importance, and this film severely lacked story, emotion, weight, and danger. A sad end to the franchise.",3
2670,"Very underrated , loved the feel of the movie , a couple small cringe parts but I would say better then 2-3 ..easy...people are such haters for anything that doesn't give them the exact feeling of what they saw when the first movie came out...people do that for any series of movies ...ignore them.",10
2671,"I am glad that torrent version came out before Premiere. It is such a proof that Karma exist. My friend Marko almost fell asleep, Stefan didnt gave up untill Trinity levitated at the and of movie. So we are happy that we watched a torrent version of this movie. Such a waste of a time.Aaaaaaaaand i am happy that they didnt put it inside Neo.",1
2672,"I enjoyed seeing this movie, amazing spec effects, soundtracks and cast.. It was all nostalgic and sweet seeing an original cast back to their places.I really don't understand why people just can't enjoy the picture and being so critical, in the end it was made supposedly to be fun..",10
2673,"Weird how after becoming a woman the director lost all their talent. I guess the sex change operations do actually work.But yes the movie is nothing new. Same lines from old movie, same characters different actors in some places for some dumb reason. Laurence fishburne is gone, he was asked about it and he said to ask the director, because he doesnt know why. He would have wanted to do it. Weaving was doing another movie so he couldnt. Most likely reason is that morpheus died in a video game matrix so thats why hes gone which is quite weird that they have the games set up as canon, honestly quite stupid as the game was not good anyways. Dumb decisions all around.",3
2674,"'The Matrix Resurrections' shows us reality is still a matter of questionThe film finds appealing ways to incorporate and acknowledge its past, creating a meta-narrative that becomes increasingly self-aware as the story unfolds.The ideas of the architect and sentient beings are altered, as is everything else audiences thought they knew about this science fiction universe.Even the new Zion is like nothing anyone could've imagined all those years ago - though the legends have persisted, regardless of efforts to bury them.",10
2675,"I know what the goal was here. And they almost nailed it for me personally. However what I thought was the end of the 2nd act was actually the end of the movie. This film obviously fell short for me. The fighting sequences didnt feel dynamic, and actually quite crammed literally with stunt performers. This flick needed another 40 minutes to tell a complete story. Sequel baiting should be illegal because you get endings like this one.",7
2676,"It's hard to say this without offending a few ones; I truly don't understand why Lana/Larry Wachoski wrote a Gen X Movie to please Millennials and Gen Z people? Many movies have fell into the same issue later. They forget their original crowd to please a new audience... so wrong. The original essence of the movie is totally gone now!! ...filled with bad jokes and non-sense scripts trying to overstate social/political issues... yes, we all get what is about Matrix, but it's awkward listening the characters talk too much about it. Someone needs to create a ""Change.org"" link to demand a better sequel of Matrix.",3
2677,"Why is everything so obvious?Serve a steak, not something pre-chewed.A black cat? - Wonderful, everyone will get it, but for the sake of any respect... why name the cat this obvious?",4
2678,"It brought me back instantly. One of the best movies of my youth came back with the same atmosphere but in a new Matrix. And it felt great. Some scenes were there just to hype up the nostalgia card and it worked. I don't understand if it didn't meet the Christopher Nolan standard, it's also not terrible as the rating shows. The current 5.7 IMDb rating is for really bad movies, those unwatchable, that lack quality in all fields. By far this is not such a movie. Both original Neo and Trinity are here and I mean it in a good way. The story went even deeper, especially from philosophical point the message of waking up is more relevant now than it was when the original came out. The excecution was great on all levels. Very entertaining, atmospheric, visually and storywise. I'm glad they did this one so the story ends now as it deserves. And looking back on all of it together, maybe he had enough of the praise (he's non stop getting) long time ago but, for my generation, Keanu Reeves, you're the one.",10
2679,"I was not quite sure if it was a movie I was watchingor a bunch of random clips put together because theDirector just gave up.....How is it even possible to ruin a movie this much... ???I hope anyone that contributed to makeing this garbage are in SHAME.....The saddest part is that I watched it to the end.. in hope of something would eventually happening....but no... 2 hours+ of pure eye Diarrhea....Hope the people that made this.. never get the opportunity to make another movie in their life !I gonna write a email right now and contact my Movie Distributor, to get my money back... because when you make something this bad... it feels like a scam....great job to Annihilate the Matrix brand and make the most boring / Nobrain / Uncool / movie in the history of mankind.... Really Wishing I have never watched this... the only good part is... NOW I know How bad a movie can be haha... I didn't believe that it was possible before now.... as they would say in ""Kung Fu Panda "" "" Now there is a LEVEL Zero """,1
2680,"I don't remember watching any sequel the director would just cut footage of the original movie into it. What's the point? A reminder how bad the replacement actors are?And where's the carefully designed Matrix world the original movie has created? Instead The Matrix Resurrections is just like a San Francisco tourism promo video.Disaster, period.",1
2681,"To all those who gave ""Resurrections"" a rating of one, are you aware of how many really bad movies you rated with a higher rating. I rightly doubt you've ever been a Matrix trilogy fan. At least try to be honest by giving this movie a proper rating which is certainly not the lowest one.",8
2682,"I can not imagine that I would fast-forwarding Matrix. But God, I've skipped 70% of a Matrix movie! Creators just want your money for this low-quality Shmatrix comedy. Poor Keanu...Shame!",1
2683,"All I say, they should never had thought of remaking at the first place!It seemed more like a bollywood movie.The action part is copy paste but not as good as in original.The unnecessary tasks included just to extend the movie.The poor love story!",1
2684,The feeble attempt to turn the Matrix into a love story failed miserably. I'm very disappointed! Don't waste your time or money on this literal garbage.,2
2685,"I'm shocked at the negative reviews of the movie. This movie was everything and beyond I could have hoped for in a Matrix 4. The plot was laser focused, the graphics were phenomenal. The acting was outstanding. The action sequences were the best in all 4 movies. Why this isn't scoring an avg of 9/10 on IMDB is puzzling to me. I loved it!!!",10
2686,"Two stars in my rating are for the characters I love and adore so much - Neo and Trinity. Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne-Moss are great in their roles under the circumstances. Everything else about the movie saddened me. If you expect to be taken to the world you know from the first three movies, you'll be disappointed because you'll see dull and generic movie making that can be experienced by watching literally any other action or sci-fi movie. Effects, fighting, script, camera and even acting of everyone else but the two actors are all average or below average. Nothing in this film will blow you away, surprise or even make feel good. I wanted to like it so much, but I found myself being bored pretty much the whole time. Do watch the movie, it's nice to see a bit of Neo and Trinity again, but please don't expect much. All that being said, there is one good thing, Resurrections made me cherish the memories of the first three films dearly.",2
2687,"Since you have to like the fourth part in the Matrix series for what it is -- and indeed it is a Resurrection. Nothing more, nothing less. That is why I rated 8 out of 10. But for a 10 out of 10, you will have to reinvent, create a new world as bright as the old one was. A world that is able to reflect all these anomalies of today, not of those 20 years ago. Matrix was resurrected, but got stuck in a time bubble in that past time. And this is the culprit, why Matrix 4 hasn't got those high ratings like they were given and deserved for Matrix. Because Matrix was marvelous in reflecting the Zeitgeist of the Millennium. While Matrix 4 let's you sleep on and even lets you enjoy dreaming a bit.",8
2688,"Never reviewed any of Matrix movies. There never was much to talk about. Very artificial and pretentious story that was just well shot. And the only good bits of story it had -stolen from few average books. First was a happy accident. And then they banked on the name with almost nothing to say. Just like the first one. Of course there will be 4th and 5th movie. What i did not know- they have a sense of humor. Openly admitting what drives the Matrix series so superfans would get on the ground a bit and stop the BS like it ever was something serious. Read books guys! BTW. Both GITS and Matrix were ""inspired"" by pop sci-fi books by William Gibson. That were very artificial commercial books to begin with. So even the inspiration and base material was not that great. Of modern writers i would recommend Ted Chiang and Peter Watts.",6
2689,At least it is better than Matrix revolutions!This is made for People who think movies like The Last Jedi and terminator dark date is Great.Just open wide and gobble up the agenda leftovers they are feeding you.,3
2690,"A disgusting film that parasitizes on a great trilogy. Absolutely pointless plot and absolutely mediocre action. An absolutely hacky and meaningless work, where the director (sha) tells us his personal experiences and worldview, the worldview of a sick person. The whole film is a veiled and sometimes not very, tribute to the modern agenda. Where the main thing is not the story, not the plot, not the character, and not even the visual picture, but the agenda. Morbius is a laughingstock, compared to the original trilogy, he is such a dummy that you forget about this character as soon as he disappears from the frame. Trinity is a disgrace that goes after Morbius as soon as she disappears from the screens. There are secondary characters because it is necessary, remove them from the film and nothing will change, even now it is difficult to remember who was called and what he did in the film. And once again action, remember the fight when neo freed morbius. Remember those emotions, hail of bullets, epic swings? Well, forget it. Like this movie.",5
2691,"Lana Wachowski shame on you putting out this Crap! Even a little boy could write better Story's than this. Even if somebody else would take the Role from Neo and the whole Story would be renewed, i would appreciate more than this. And what about Lilly did she actually work on this Script. It would be better to have waited 10 more Years to bring out a more profound and intuitive Story even if Neo and Trinity would be total different Characters i wouldn't mind. Why do you have to take Clips from the first Matrix ,why ? Why putting out old Material when you can make a new one. It would be better that somebody else would have directed this probably this would make a whole difference. I mean it really even a fan-based Movie Director with the Money of Warner Brothers could've made a Gigantic New Start for Matrix 4. So to conclude this i would take my time and wait until a good Story is in your Mind and then Give it to a realiable Writer who has a deep Respect for this Movie and start to write on Matrix 5.",1
2692,"The movie is a bad parody of the original Matrix.As much as I wanted to like it, the plot doesn't make sense at all. The movie is full of meta references to the first movie to remind us how good it was. Then it makes jokes about how big companies make bad sequels just to grab some more money. And they are doing exactly that!",1
2693,"I love certain female directors like Nora Ephron, but I wonder if the Washkovski women are out of their element as directors. This movie is a gigantic mess; I could not finish it. Movies are supposed to be visual stories that have some sort of continuity by themselves, not confusing flashbacks and ridiculous platitudes. Makes you really appreciate good directors like Joe Wright. There is no getting by the fact that the first movie was stupendous. Why wasn't it possible to do it again?",2
2694,"I feel as though the Matrix trilogy was just mocked. Was this a spoof? A parody? A cruel joke? I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this. I will never watch this again. Actually, I'm going to pretend I never saw it after I leave this review. I guess Hollywood is expired.",1
2695,"Terrible acting... slow/bad editing... so many actors playing the film instead of being in the character... also worrying about how they sound versus focusing on the other person.Female lead is pretty good, but she is a bit boring.The drastic extreme decline of the concept/story/script from the first film kinda gives a bit of evidence to the possibility they really did steal the script from Sophia Stewart. When people steal ideas, they never get them right.I'm watching the film right now and it's atrociously bad directing.The whole thing reminds me of when that film student who never listens and never intended to learn anything, just wants to make a ""cool movie"" like ""The Godfather"" and then spend their whole time ripping off ideas from their favourite films while trying to pass them off for their own. Not an original thought in their head.",
2696,"Loved the matrix but if I wanted to watch the first film I would of done just that. Hundreds of scenes from the original, poor story line, really disappointing. Felt like it has been written in 5 minutes.Gets a 5 solely because it's still the matrix.",5
2697,"Just terrible, absolutely terrible. Weak story, uninspiring characters, bad acting, felt like the writers put the script together in a few days and just didn't care to develop it. I reckon they added the digitised morpheus fraud later on when they realised it sucked without morpheus - but it just made it even worse - it doesn't flow as a story at all - it sucks - I know there are worse films - but for $100+ million budget and all the talents involved it is just unacceptable and so I give this 1/10. Major disappointment. Avoid.",1
2698,15 minutes into the movie i started having a gut feeling that this movie is not going to be very good but i was patient i thought to myself I'll give it another chance then 15 minutes passed and after watching the first action scene ( the action scenes looks terrible and super cheap) i told myself the only reason I'll finish watching this trash is because i loved the trilogy (and keanu reeves) .For conclusiondefinitely take the blue pill I'll recommend even two.,3
2699,I might not get the whole concept but still applauded Lana Wachowski's audacity take on meta-theme sci-fi action. Neo &amp; Trinity took longer time to get up and running into exciting action sequences (also sweet romance) that bring back nostalgic moments.,6
2700,"The latest and third sequel to the original breakout classic Matrix (1999) has similar evolutions like Alien: Resurrection (1997), the fourth Alien (1979) movie. Each has something refreshingly new, both though had similar weakness using the unoriginal ""more is better"" mentality. With this new version of Matrix, there is a striking originality in places but shocking loose ends or poor continuity with a number of scenes where magical rescues seem to occur even as virtual reality is supposed to offer endless possibilities. The lack of the return of more original cast members even with the attempt to make up for them while impressive falls short of expectations for original audience members. With this strong storyline, Matrix did deserve a fourth movie, but it also deserved still more scriptwriting reworking to make this movie even better. Even the ending scene could have depicted a dazzling rainbow surprise. A nice attempt though and a nice nod to the original trilogy. Neil Patrick Harris gets a special mention for his characterization and role in the movie too.",7
2701,As soon as I saw the title I knew this can't be good. Lol of course Keanu being one of my favorite actors I was going to watch this movie no matter how awful and boring it was. Yes it's not a good movie and yes the story line is pretty much boring and really anything particular to care for. The characters are very shallow and you really don't care for any of them. But again if they make another one I'd probably watch.,6
2702,Bit of a soulless cash grab. Doesnt really add anything to the established story and utterly forgettable.I didnt walk out the cinema with any harsh feelings though because I didnt go in expecting anything else.I hope this new breath of life at least inpsires a new video game. Sorely overdue for one.,2
2703,"This is so heart breaking to watch for a fan who watched the original trilogy about ten times. The originals were ground breaking in visual effects, scripts, and action, this one is none of that, it's even not good enough for an ""average"" 2021 movie.",1
2704,"This movie answers some questions. It also creates some new questions. Ultimately, great entertainment. All the Negativity is purely due to some grudge and unfulfilled expectations. However, if you want entertainment, this is a great movie, and it expands the Matrix universe.",9
2705,"You know those movies that suck you in so you forget the passage of time and then it's suddenly over? This isn't one of those. It's a rebooty sequel with nothing great to add to the story. Conversations are long and lead to nothing interesting. There's not a single interesting character. The only redeeming factor is the special effects which were pretty cool, and even they, didn't make me go ""WOW"". Like the title said, it was quite hard to get to the end without yawning. Save a few bucks and rewatch the trilogy instead.",4
2706,"The first half is talking about how Neo back, with some flashbacks, and the last half is to saving the heroine.It introduces some new backgrounds, like the war between the robots. And human get some robot friends, and people are planting some green vegetables... and in the new generation of matrix, they control the people using their emotions, not rationality any more.But it's, boring.",5
2707,"The film is basically references, criticisms and reviews about the Matrix franchise.We have many ''revived'' elements such as characters, flashbacks and retcons of the original story. The movie is a good narrative but the action is not so cool, it's not a bad movie, but it's also far from the first. The best part is the last one. Act with an outcome that gives a new ending to the Matrix franchise, this quadrilogy honestly has to end because despite the movie not being so good it closes the saga perfectly.",6
2708,"The new Matrix movie, titled ""Matrix Resurrections"" is a terrible entry to the series. Out of 10 this movie is at max a 4, but it needs to be broken into two parts, like the originals. This movie is a waste of a golden opportunity to show the true believers in the the Matrix that the real world is much more complex and many times even worse.If you've never seen a Matrix movie, you'll be thrown off by the effects and overall dark visual style. Don't worry, you'll get used to it pretty quickly. Keanu Reeves is a good actor, and plays Neo well. You might see some people going, ""Gee, he's pretty hot."" I get it, that's what happens when you're hot. In the beginning you might think Neo is a dumbass. He definitely doesn't belong in this world. In fact he did make it out of the first movie alive. The Matrix was created for him and probably for the rest of the population.Most people would just be happy to be alive. Neo is not the most mature, but he has a lot of heart. He has his share of regrets and fails, but he does succeed eventually. The only thing Neo ever really lost was his ""blank."" The Matrix was ""real"" to him, but as the movie goes on, it becomes obvious that the Neo of the first Matrix is much more nuanced and humanized. The new Matrix goes out of its way to show that there's more to people than just black and white ""good and evil"". That part of Neo's life is Golden.",4
2709,"This franchise has all the right points to make a grand triple A video game. This movie though wasn't really what was needed and unfortunately the reboot may have done more damage to the franchise than if it was never made.Visually it's very impressive. Story wise... meh. I got bored pretty quickly, and there were parts that simply didn't make much sense.Ot does not have the feeling of the first (or latter parts).Do it justice, release a video game or even a cartoon, but I'd like to keep Keanu's legacy intact. What is really sad, he has got noticeably older, and that's the first time I could see it in the movie.",6
2710,This has more to do with Lana the director transitioning into a female then it does the matrix. The ending song is a female cover of rage against the machine. Just to some it up.,1
2711,"If you still haven't seen it, be prepared, because ""The Matrix Resurrections"" is NOT a sequel to ""The Matrix"" original films, it's a spin-off! To some, that's for worse, to others, for better.There aren't many specific spoilers in this review, but if you haven't watched the film yet, you'd better do so now!In this instalment, Neo is Thomas Anderson, the programmer of a successful game trilogy called ""The Matrix."" Against his will, an associated company, Warner Bros., is going to release a sequel, with or without him, so he decides to do it. There's where the ""M4"" project starts.The viewer is presented a series of re-enactments of the previous films, with ""different names"" and ""different faces,"" like the iconic Trinity's police bust opening scene, the sparing program simulation, the helicopter shooting, the Merovingian's hall fight and so on, most of them interleaved with quick flashback image bursts from the original trilogy. Even the closing credits' song, ""Wake Up,"" is a version of the original from Rage Against The Machine (exactly the same arrangement, but it's sung by a female voice.)The film manages to tell two completely different stories at the same time, one is the somewhat preposterous ""sequel"" to ""The Matrix,"" in which both Neo and Trinity had been saved, their bodies healed and restored and their minds reconnected to the Matrix by the machines through the course of sixty years, although their current memories span in the simulation for about twenty (to match the ageing of the actors since the original trilogy was filmed,) while the other is a criticism of the show business and the film industry, and to some sectors of society that have usurped elements from the films for the most nefarious purposes, like the whole ""red pill"" absurdity.How much one likes this film greatly depends on what it's expecting from it. I was expecting the worst, a pale and watered down copy of the previous films or a forced sequel to a story that had been, effectively, finished. Instead, what was presented was a joke, in the best sense of the word, woven in an array of references to the franchise and to itself, breaking not only the fourth wall, metaphorically and literally, right there on the first seconds of the film, but also turning a mirror to ourselves and asking the fundamental question, if we, spectators, didn't want a sequel to ""The Matrix,"" why are we watching it? Like the Oracle would've said, we're not here to choose to watch or not, we're here to understand the choice we already made.Don't take it the wrong way, though. It's not a comedy, not even a dark one, for that matter. Don't expect ""Deadpool"" (2016) levels of jokes and straight jabs. It's sardonic and sarcastic and, because of that, extremely entertaining, although, perhaps for the right mood, mindset or even personality. For those that are a little bit ""slower,"" the film even has an after-credits blooper to assure to the viewer that what they have just watched is a joke.Summarising, it's a film for the fans of ""The Matrix"" that loved it for the intricacy of its subjects, both scripted and metaphorical, but possibly not for those that were in it for the ""bullet time"" kills.If you loved the stories told in ""The Animatrix,"" mainly those that better depicted the universe of Neil Gaiman's ""Goliath"" short story, then be prepared to take your favourite coloured pill and follow the black cat! Welcome to the Catrix!",10
2712,"It was ok. I watched the original trilogy leading up to seeing Resurrections. Maybe that was a mistake. The first thing I notice was how the quality seemed lower...which should be impossible with how much newer the technology is. I have my suspicions as to why they would allow us to feel that way in the opening sequence. But without knowing their motivation, I was left underwhelmed and actively thinking how this felt cheap.The story is alright, nothing special. There are a few familiar faces. But I never felt a connection to the new ones. For such a long movie, it felt lacking in storytelling, which shouldn't be possible.If they make another one, I'll probably watch it. But this movie either didn't need to be made or needed more time cooking. I do wonder if missing one-half of the original visionaries meant we also lost half of the vision and creativity.",6
2713,"Once you make a good movie there was the curse of the sequel, nothing can be truer with Matrix trilogy and now tetralogy. A movie that started out bringing a digital perspective to the concept of maya according to which the world we live in isn't real and is a creation of our own mental perspectives. The story tellers of the trilogy lacked the depth to take the movie further beyond the first part. The fourth makes a mockery of the idea itself. The movie portrays Neo stuck in a game with an evil analyst who is Anderson's shrink keeping him firmly grounded to the reality which is the matrix which is not the reality. Ironically Anderson is the architect of the game or atleast lead to believe so where he keeps retelling the story of the matrix. The movie rushes through the induction sequence with tributes to the first part, which vacillates between self deprecating humour to tributes or reruns of scenes from the first part. This movie is about Neo rediscovering his super powers to becoming no longer the One. Matrix is now about the Duo of Neo and Trinity laying the foundation to future parts. Please don't make another one. The first part brought to the industry ground breaking digital effects this movie barely mimics the ones in the trilogy. The Wachowski's have done well for themselves and brought a great movie to all of us which we love, now is where you must stop and move on to something else.",2
2714,"Huge fan of the original movies. I really tried to enjoy the movie and convince myself it was good but it was so terrible. Characters were forgettable, storyline made no sense but the most unforgivable for me was the fight scenes sucked. The first movies were iconic, this was pure trash. Please stop butchering good franchises WB.",1
2715,"1. I've decided that old people shouldn't do hand to hand fighting scenes.2. When humans wake up from the pods their faces and heads are shaved, why?3. IO can generate artificial skies, isn't that really energy intensive, couldn't the machines just make use of the same energy source, surely it would be less troublesome.4. The existence of the movie negates everything that happened in Matrix reloaded. It would've been an infinitly better movie if this was a new incarnation of the anomaly.5. I don't know why neo was even needed in this movie, it was clear why they needed him in the first movie, he was the equalizer against the agents in the matrix.I'll give this a 5, at least it's not another marvel/DC superhero movie.",5
2716,"So much potential wasted, after watching The Animatrix I honestly think a Matrix film without Neo and Trinity would have been better than this rubbish. Trinity and Neo are like cartoon characters now, superman and superwoman flying around on a mission to save humanity, give me a break. The action scenes where ok but nothing to write home about, I don't know why they just didn't get the John Wick crew to choreograph the fight scenes as they were lacklustre at best. The CGI was decent and up to its usual standard and overall, this movie was ok but to be brutally honest ok isn't good enough especially after this length of time, it's all visually very nice but there's just no substance.",3
2717,"It's just a ""remake"", seriously, just some new actors mimicking the first film.Waste of time &amp; money from us and resources from them.Why, really why do this one so bad, and release?So disappointed!!! 😷😷😷😔😔😔",2
2718,"Terrible, and saddest storyline I've experienced! What a disappointing follow on to a great story, stick with John wick, As I am a big Matrix enthusiast but this was absolute horse s*#t......",1
2719,Perfect casting. Love the characters. Great plot. Mindblowing as per usual. Everything the Matrix should beThe plot itself is clever. Nice mix of a remake and a sequel. And as confusing as ever. Love it.,10
2720,"All I gotta say is, thank goodness John Wick was better than this! Sorry, this is trash. They should of made this movie years ago to have the same essence from the previous Matrix.Eh.",2
2721,"As a Matrix property I would consider this movie close to unwatchable. Its a absolute failure in its own right in every aspect and a travesty as a sequel. And the worst part is that the Movie is perfectly aware of this. These failures are acts of self sabotage because of the shared dislike for the sequel, not mistakes. Rather then a excuse Its self awareness is insult to any one invested in this film. The dialogue has gone from hard to grasp discussions on free will and reality to you're crazy uncles facebook posts. Iconic culture defining characters have been replaced with cookie cutter knock offs. The story makes little to no sense with entire scenes, characters and story arcs being pointless to the progression of the plot. The action is sloppy, repetitive and unoriginal with none of choreographyWhat's worse the movie constantly comments on all of these failures ridiculing these faults and any one expecting better rather then fixing them.",1
2722,"The Matrix Resurrections is like a comedy spinoff from the original trilogy. The characters are shallow, the story's making every bend possible to justify the rediculous desciprancies from the previous movies. The plot is your standard off the mill Hollywoodian action movie with great action, great CGI, but made to turn your brain on 0. I have no problem turning my brain on semi-braindead stance, but not when it lasts two hours and definitely not when one of my (formerly) favorite movie series is concerned. It has the stupid dry comic attempts that are so common in all modern action movies, which makes me cry more than laugh. Characters are saying stuff like OMG and WTF. I'm just hoping this movie is a bad dream that involves John Wick in a b-graded comedy. Man I only saw the first 30 minutes but I could write a book just talking about how dissapointed I am, the worst thing is that book would even be better than this movie. TLDR: teenage action movie.",3
2723,Just terrible all around even if you don't see it as a continuation. The originals were innovative... this just included a bunch of terribly inserted flashbacks that just didn't fit and garbage fight scenes. Straight to stream is all this movie should have been.,3
2724,"The bar was set high and many fans of the original trilogy were hyped up for this - as suspected, this long awaited sequel didn't deliver the goods.This movie was such a missed opportunity - they had a chance to reestablish/revitalise the story and explore depths and content that was uncharted in the previous films. They decided not to do this.The biggest problem I had is that the plot was dull and lifeless. 18 years to follow up with a story like this? Why? The narrative was so pointless and boring that I was barely interested in the final act and was clock watching to see how much was left to endure. The most interesting scene was the final one, which leaves the door open for more but I'm not going to hold my breath and wait another 5 years or so for another lacklustre attempt.Characterwise, not enough familiar faces returned for this. I couldn't accept Agent Smith being played by a different actor, nor the absence of Lawrence Fishborne as Morpheus. The Merovingian character was unrecognisable and his return was underwhelming. Worst of all, I couldn't accept the constant comedy attempts at humorous one liners. This is The Matrix - a once serious franchise, not a comedy. Whoever decided that this movie needed constant 'laugh out loud' one liner pops in the script is a moron.Keanu Reeves - we've grown to love his laid back approach to acting but not in this movie. His performance was lifeless, wooden and he had very little to do or work with.If the plan is to make another two movies, then this reboot is nothing more than an entry level transitional film to re-establish the story. Nothing major really happens and unfortunately, the entire vibe and energy that made the trilogy a classic is gone. If you're looking for philosophical content you'll be disappointed. This is a lightly serious, yet comedic action movie, where the action scenes are neither exciting or necessary. It just felt like they were going through the motions.Was there anything good? Hardly - some of the meta material was interesting at a push. Visually it looked ok but didn't capture the vibe of the original films.To summarise, I struggle to really praise anything. I'm not angry, just disappointed. 5/10.",5
2725,The matrix franchise ended at Matrix Revolutions and the 22 year waiting period must be recorded in the Guinness world records as the most vain period ever in waiting for a sequel.,4
2726,"I saw my first matrix when I was 16 at the theaters and it just blew my mind as the rest of my generation. A masterpiece of cinematography. Costumes-photography - and directed revolution with the 360 camera ( sorry if I make some errors English is not my native language)Then it was matrix 2 wich I actually also liked it was like a full time action movie on the matrix system -fine by meAnd then it came matrix 3 .I understand the need to explain some things and close the trilogy with an ending I found not fully satisfying but I understood.Then time passed I got married I got kidsAnd out of the blue I read about matrix 4.Couldn't wait for it !! I just finished watching it and I am rather disappointed.I don't know if Netflix has that great impact on industry but the movie felt so .. quickly made , the costumes the battles the camera on the battles nothing had the quality of the past.I was kind of worried that the movie would be full of stunts or cgi because Keanu has a certain age but that was not the problem. The scenario lines at some point were bombing with names and informations the flashbacks were cute but... they gone a bit far.I liked Neil Patrick Harris on his role. That's what I keep.Keanu which I adore , has kept the John wicks attitude in my opinion he was unnoticed the whole film as neo.Niobe's makeup was the most ridiculous thing I ve seen lately.Finally Carrie an moss was descent enough on her role.Bottom line I wish they could made a glitch on the matrix and remake matrix 4 because in my opinion it was like a glitch on matrix world. And fans didn't deserve that kind of movieI hope wakofski will understand and will leave the myth now on his peace as they were planning to.P.s. I still believe into the matrix00100101010101010111001.",6
2727,"Seriously, I enjoyed it more than I thought. It was a fitting chapter in the series. Was it as mind blowing as the first 3? Not really.. but I was still entertained and understood the reasoning and concept behind everything. I do hope it continues despite the minority who didn't enjoy it as much.",8
2728,"Keanu has been rocking that pube beard for so long I forgot he's actually a handsome guy. This movie was a little better than I expected. Nowhere near what the first matrix was but that's a pretty tall order. Watching the characters struggle to figure out what's actually going on in the story while struggling to figure out what's actually going on with the story myself was a bit off putting. I wasn't sure if I was stupid or if the movie was. Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter. There's also a lot of sunglasses with fun frames, which is fun.",4
2729,"Man there is no 3,5 therefore my rating is 4 ONLY because the computer effects were decent. Apart for them, Lana should go consider making LGBT movies for people with haircuts like Denis Rodman.I hate to say this but it feels like the movie was made in correspondence with the so modern LGBT movements lately. Nothing in common with the first 3 series and it is basically like comparing a Mercedes S-class to the most budget Indian TATA . Not to mention that freedom , choice etc modern clichés that had to to be implemented in the story at the highest possible level were better pictured in ""Dont look Up"" - I mean come on. Who wants to see the 4th part of The Godfather looking like a Marvel production. Total waste of time and money.",4
2730,"I didn't really liked the plot... it didn't seem matrix universe , just a romantic movie that should have been realized for valentines day... Neo wardrobe made me wonder if we were seeing Matrix or Jonh Wick... It was nice to see characters again but I was waiting for a memorable movie.... but the result it's exactly the opposite it was a better saga without the latest movie.",6
2731,"Coming in a close second behind Ghostbusters 2016, this is one of the most pointless self-owns of an IP for a while.A shameless cash-grab poorly-disguised as sequel that takes more away from canon than it adds to it, this pointless movie ironically elevates the less-flawed sequels to a point where they're no longer the worst Matrix movies, so at least there's some positivity lurking in there.As bumbling as Matrix Revolutions was at times, it at least tied up the story with a convincing conclusion, leaving just enough to the imagination to feel that everything was going to be all right, leaving the story as a trilogy...a Trinity even.But no, let's just unbalance the whole thing with a fourth instalment that requires mountains of exposition to crudely shoehorn it into something that feels like a giant parody of itself.The brief cameo of the Merovingian returning as a disheveled, barely-coherent shadow of his former elegant self doing nothing but standing in the corner shouting profanities at everyone while a obligatory yawnfest of wireline fight sequences plays out and then vanishing without adding any narrative to the movie is the perfect analogy to how this fits into the original trilogy.Avoid.",2
2732,Watched this in theater with friends. All four of us fell asleep. Such a disgrace to the original series. Action scenes are boring as hell. It's all about a reunion of Neo and Trinity. The plot is lame as hell like any mediocre romantic story. Actually wanted to left the movie 15 minutes in. Definitely not what you expect if you are a fan of the original series.,1
2733,Pointless and waste time and money. Like others I fell asleep and left before the end. I do not know how anyone involved can justify this movie other than trying to cash in... Really disappointed.,1
2734,"As a long-time fan of the Matrix franchise, ""The Matrix Resurrections"" came as an unexpected Christmas gift from Lana Wachowski, for which I will always be grateful.It's sad to see reviews from people claiming to be Matrix fanatics and then proceeding to bash this film just because it's not what they believe the Matrix is. It makes me wonder if that's the same people the film itself makes fun of, all those believing that the Matrix is about bullet-time, lots of guns and kung-fu. No wonder they all feel called out.There is a line that says ""they took your (Neo's) story, something that meant so much to people like me, and turned it into something trivial"" and that line hit hard. Lana Wachowski boldly proceeds to take apart the trilogy's aesthetic to reveal that beneath the green filter and sublime action, the motivating power has always been love. Neo spends days and days in an office, listening to people talk about what the Matrix is and what everybody thinks when they hear of it, while his mind is focused on one thing only: Trinity. It's an interesting montage that, in true Matrix form, you don't necessarily get during your first watch. It reveals what has always been the force beneath the powers of the One. It reveals that Neo never became the One just because he was, but he became the One because Trinity believed in him.In parallel form, the film shows us how Neo's belief in Trinity awoke her own powers as part of the One. And ultimately, while it closes with the unfortunate observation that we, the ""sheeple"", will never pursue freedom because of how dependent we now are from technology and machinery, ""The Matrix Resurrections"" reminds us what a free mind and love can do: they can make us fly away and build a better world.It's a wonderfully meta film, it's a wonderful love story, it brought back so many memories and hit us with nostalgia, it has exceptional imagery and fantastic performances... If I could give it a 20 out of 10 I would. Give it a chance before you let yourself be influenced by the words of haters. This film might as well change your world.",10
2735,"Aww what a shame,, i had so many hopes that this movie would be great but unfortunately it turned.out to be as described...a disaster...holy moly where to start.Firstly i cannot believe Carrie anne moss and Keano Reaves signed up for this?The only positive i think is the addition of smith albeit from another actor and the twist was great for me ...but still...the film was all over the place....They brought neo and trinity back from the dead(real life bodies)...if they had just put them in the matrix i would have got it,understood it,and probably loved it but the writers went nuts on this and i think actually lost the plot...thank god i did not waste my money at the cinema on this trash...",4
2736,"Yes, because they had to Resurrect some budget from somewhere to make a so lackluster version: recycling most of the trilogy, and not putting more to an original storyline; if you don't know much about computers ask computer experts fans of SciFi and The Matrix, ask the public, but not this mediocre attempts to do a The Matrix sequel, it sucked at some parts, brilliants at others, unexplained Neo power's failure... he was old and tired, because for sure looked that way. This was a Golden Ticket Opportunity and they blew it, sad and disappointing. And The Catrix? Really?",1
2737,Very disappointing..... Was hoping for so much more. Maybe it's because the other brother wasn't involved in making the movie? Idk. Just a huge let down.,1
2738,"There were points of it being really great - notably the beginning. But so much of it is poor transitions followed by confusing dialog. I found myself rewinding to see if I missed something multiple times - but no I hadn't missed anything. The transitions between scenes and the editing in general is just bad.Also, WB needs to stop promoting themselves in everything they do (Space Jam 2). Only Disney is allowed to do that - WB is no Disney. Which to me is just another sign that their franchises need to die.In the end it is a decent flick with some good performances and an alright story...But...THE MATRIX is not properly RELOADED, it is not a REVOLUTION and has not had any RESURRECTIONS. (ha-ha)",6
2739,"My expectations were low going in. I loved the first three, but I refused to let myself get excited about this one after so long.I was afraid that like so many other delayed sequels, this too would wax political, become a woke platform, be little more than a nostalgia piece or just a poorly-conceived cash-grab. None of this was the case at ALL!A lot of people are complaining because it didn't flow the same as the other three. It's lighter on action. It seems to convolute the story. This is all true, but that's actually a big part of what makes it great: it's NOT the same movie you've already seen. It's smart. It's grown into something more than just fight choreography and camera tricks. Old characters come back but in unexpected ways that (for the most part) genuinely contribute to the story.Whereas the John Wick movies seem to get worse with every sequel - I'm thrilled to say that The Matrix universe may still have some real entertainment value left in it.",10
2740,"Unbelievably bad. Like, from the very first scene it's just garbage-water. Blue haired female protagonist enters after 2 minutes and the whole thing just falls apart. The cinematography is lame, the acting is bad, the fights are poorly edited and barely choreographed.",1
2741,The only thing i liked about the movie is the fact that they criticize it in the movie by saying basically it's not worth watching. Perhaps Catrix is what we really deserve.,1
2742,So one night my boyfriend said let's go to the cinema and just pick a movie right on the spot.Sure it was very nice idea we went and took matrix.So film started very confusing like they lost the track and then a lots of woman with different hair styles and color that prefer also women started like fighting man's style so strong empowering my god that was the worst 2h were I felt like they kidnapped me and glued to the chair.The worst disappointment of all was protagonist that I don't know lost his manhood and become very useless.,1
2743,"I love this actor to the w bit. But, what a h... Thise movie is noting like first 3. The action is boring, almost sad. If the movie was made to be all about te Trinity, then why there is only few scenes about her . Lady from the coffee shop, that's all.Neo was the man before and now he only use invisible bullet proof umbrella. Now he looks week and not even strong as some new lady called led trinity is. What a shame and lost of hope!",2
2744,"After watching 40 minutes i was more positive that this movie was only to make money, the casting is worse they arent even doing same acting as the last 3 matrix i watched.Has anyone noticed that neo look like john wick, you know they could have done better hair for this movie.You know for trinity if they gave her a bit of make up would been better, she looked very old like she doesnt want to act.The movie was like a salad everything mixing up you cant even understand, ""where was the peace they had""",1
2745,"I was not such a big fan of The Matrix when it came out in 1999. Maybe because I was already mid-30 (I found it a tad childish with those black leather clothes and dark glasses, sorry), maybe because I had already seen the earlier Dark City, or maybe because I do not like so many bullets missing their target.But I did not expect such an amusing movie. Matrix Resurrections is clearly taking its legacy not seriously (any more). I love a little dry humor here and there. And I enjoyed the idea that in this movie WB wants to make The Matrix 4, and Neo and Agent Smith are involved in finding a new concept...I also liked Neo being nearly always in street clothes (often with a ridiculous cap).For me, Resurrections had a taste of maturing by becoming older and wiser, more relaxed and more distant to the younger self, but being aware of what truly matters. That also means that fight scenarios are not what the movie stands for. The young warrior gains power and capabilities, the old warrior decides.I concur with some harsh critics, there is not everything straight in line storywise, there is a kind of willing sloppiness in the movie that lets the fan community sometimes standing in the rain...It does fan service of course, the whole movie is that, but only to a certain degree, I found that brave.Except for the nice and friendly sentiels, of course.The Matrix Resurrections is a good and entertaining movie, great cinematography, decent acting, nothing groundbreaking but in a way documenting evolution of style and direction.And Carry Anne Moss steals every scene she is in.I gave this movie 8 stars, on one side to even a little the unjust underrating it received here for whatever reason, and on the other hand because it entertained me very well.A personal advice for the producers I would like to give is, not to stream a movie that cost so much, while it runs in theaters. I do not know what the streaming service paid, but it certainly cannot fill the gap between box office and production costs.",
2746,"Visually beautiful but.... unnecessary? I think so.Neo was unstoppable, but like everyone, has lost a bit of pace.The story line, unfortunately, thinks it's cleverer than it is, but is not a patch on the original.It's ""metaness"" comes across as obsurd.The weakest of the Matrix films in my opinion and the franchise would probably have been better left alone.",6
2747,Rated this a 4 after the first viewing. But just like the 2nd &amp; 3rd instalment it takes more than 1 viewing to appreciate the nuances &amp; humour hidden within. Watch it again.,8
2748,"Except the trailer was free - the film wasn'tThe film was just plain boring. The plot was thin, not original. The opening got very 'Meta', which was a big mistake IMO. Not quite breaking the the 4th wall, but close. The problem is that the film couldn't quite shake this off, and as a result your immersion into the matrix universe was halted as the entrance. I suspect this is opposite to the effect intended, and is a result of short cuts in the writing. Bad judgement here.This film could not rely on the spectacle, as we've seen all the effects many times, so it needed a good story. Unfortunately it didn't get one. What a shame.It wasn't a bad film, nor, as others have claimed, a woke-fest, It was just dull. Found myself falling asleep half way through. The ending seemed to appear without the full blown crescendo, and then the ending itself ended. My reaction - 'Was that it?'",5
2749,Absolutely disappointing.Story is boring and weird.Fight scenes are nothing in comparison to the original trilogy.The over all visual esthetic is different than the original trilogy.The performance of Keanu Reeves was week. The side characters are forgettable.I expect more. A lot more.It is just a money grap.Watched it in theater. But should have saved my money.Weakest movie of the year.,1
2750,"Usually the plot and the cgi were compensating for the bad performance of Keanu. But this time they couldn't. Weak characters, mediocre plot. So disappointed because I really liked the previous Matrix movies.",2
2751,HOT GARBAGE ALERT. What an absolute jumbled mess of ridiculousness. The story is incoherent and the movie is unnecessary. I don't get why it was made and why Keanu would agree to do it is a question for the ages.,4
2752,"I had high hopes after watching every matrix in cinema, this is by far one of the worst movies I watched from action to story to no logic, I am disgusted! Wasted my money in cinemas should have waited for the release to watch it for free not even worth to watch for free don't bother.",1
2753,"I think this movie does justice to the trilogy. There's some meta-story, but in the end the Matrix Universe is the most important thing. And the link between this part and its predecessors is well justified (and every possible question addressed).I understand some of the hard reviews because of the goofiness of the introduction of the film, but those critics were maybe waiting for a repetition of the original story, and this here is something new.",10
2754,"The original Matrix trilogy, especially the first one, relied on groundbreaking visual effects and choreography to make them relevant in pop culture. The second and third installments, as flawed as they were in terms of storytelling, at least produced in that aspect of filmmaking. This installment carried on with the flawed storytelling aspect of the second and third without capturing the visually believable aspect of the original trilogy. Those stories of the original trilogy had the plot carried by amazing visuals. This was an expected storyline that didn't have the visuals to carry it.",4
2755,"What a bad movie. I did look at my friend at cinema and i said dude what we are watching right now camon lets leave the cinema. I dont recomended this movie. I thought The Director think "" ah we got Keanu Reves they have to watch that whatever we make"" so im not fan espeacilly im not stupit so pls dont watch.",2
2756,But why WB. Make.this why.It was so bad a and very boring anddistortion of the amazing trilogy.All this greed WB for more money from the fans of the trilogy.,3
2757,"I was more than disappointed with this. It felt like a poor, rushed remake of the original.If (like me) you are a die-hard fan of the original matrix, don't taint your memories by watching this!It pains me to be this harsh to anything matrix related, but trust me!",3
2758,"2 stars for acting, 0 stars for plot and cinematography. No plot movement for an hour, shots that avg. About 4 seconds each and constant clips from the first movie in an attempt to explain what's going on.",2
2759,"A shame ... a film, especially in today's world, with so much potential that this film unfortunately does not even come close to exploiting. Bad music, bad casting, bad story. This film absolutely needs a ""Jack Snyder cut""",6
2760,"First of all you must be a die hard fan of the Trilogy , Castaneda, and Eastern philosophy to understand it. I'm no specialist in CGI effects, and fighting scenes, but the the first half of the movie is Tarkowski level, with clues and referrals to ...discover them....everywhere, and the second half an ode to freedom, which is harder to get the older you are, as Don Juan said, when describing to Castaneda the enemies of the man of knowledge. All in all I found it brilliant an deeper than many movies, at the Matrix One level. Thoroughly enjoyed it!",10
2761,"Matrix one was a masterpiece. 20 years later they come up with this and everything just looks so cheap and poor. Everything about this film sucks. Directing, editing, writing.... you see better action scenes in about any film out there. Seriously I was shocked of how horrible the film looks in some parts.Anybody who took part in this cash grab should be ashamed.",
2762,"The film is very bad, after the matrix trilogy this is totally unnecessary, the film is based on too monotonous conversation, I must say that it is even too boring, I give 4 stars.",4
2763,"Is it a money grab? Of course, but then aren't every single sequel and 90% of all ""Hollywood"" movies these days? Hey, surprise, they are in the business of making money and if YOU were in charge, you'd be no different!Enter the Matrix Resurrections, a decent sequel that pushes the storyline further along. Top budget SFX and all. Definitely set up for yet another sequel.OF course it would NEVER stand up to the 1999 original mind blowing Matrix movie, what could? I heard that Keanu Reeves said to watch it 3 times, I think he's probably right, and when I get the BluRay I will turn on the captions to catch some of the words I missed in the boom box theater.",9
2764,"Enough of this remakes after remakes. This is killing American cinema and it's a reason why asian and european movies start to get more attention.People need something new. Enough of super heroes movies, enough of remakes, enough with terrible action movies with impossible and bad stuns, enough of spending millions of dollars on really bad movies but people keep watching them and giving them money even if the movie is good or not.",
2765,"After all these years how did they make this movie? It is unbeliavable. When i read the rewiews, i wondered if people were exaggerating because I liked the trailers but no way, they had right. It was almost impossible to watch. The story takes the three stars and one for the good old Matrix scenes. It is a movie that has been like made to destroy The Matrix Legacy.",4
2766,"I have to say most of the good acting was done by the younger actors. I thought it felt like the old cast mailed it in for a paycheck.Was it great ....ah, no. I thought The Matrix (1999) was great, this was not anywhere near that. The Matrix Resurrection does not cover any new ground, there aren't an new ideas presented, and no real surprises.Was it fun, yeah, kinda. Did it add anything new to the story? No, but I enjoyed the ride.",6
2767,"A good movie and it is almost a good sequel. I loved the events and the plot. Frankly, the movie was able to convey the feelings of the characters. It has good characters and also the dialogues. Each dialogue. The movie reminds you of some of the parts before, and frankly, they presented the dialogues in a smooth and enjoyable way and praised the element The evil in the film, which was presented to us by Neil Patrick, which was surprisingly good, but I did not like the speed in the transition between events. I felt that everything happened quickly and also I did not like the story of the film, which was bad looking at the season's before, but the film is good and deserves to be watched strongly, but before watching it, you should watch the parts that came before to remember the events.",6
2768,Lives up to the expectations and a must see for all Matrix fans. Packed with action and special effects. Great story. Very well done. Keanu is a on another level.,10
2769,"As a fan of Matrix I though they should have stop at the fisrt one, but when i saw Neo Flying the first time I lost all my interest in itHorribly made and why he flys????A nonsense film., Bad all aspects of it. Bad story, bad acting, all seen alredy no expectaion no sense al all.",1
2770,"After Starwars and Terminator, I expected that this movie would be The One, the exception. Nope. It is, objectively speaking, a bad movie as a Matrix movie, and a bad-to-fair movie as an independent action-romantic-scifi-ish thing.I wrote a longer quora answer about it. Long story short: a postmodern amalgam leading nowhere, calling out warner bros and facezuckberg. Like the creator hated this movie and wanted to destroy their own legacy.",1
2771,"This movie, from the beginning, informs the viewer of its purpose.The Matrix simply cannot be rebuilt, reset or rebooted.The first movie was a glitch in the source code of the Movie industry. And all attempts to recreate that moment would result in a soulless copy to fill executives' pockets. But if someone inevitably will touch it, then it better be me (Lana Wachowski).And being honest, this movie tries to pay an earnest, though pulpy tribute to the original, always aware that it would never be able to reach the heels of the first Matrix. The Matrix's subversive DNA is harnessed to criticize the industry, fan service, Hollywood's creative bankruptcy that today relies solely on cheap nostalgia and content recycling.The themes of this movie are props to make a point; and not so much to make a spectacle of a Marxist analysis of society. We do not live in the same world of 20 years ago.And yet, there is still enough room for high concept sci-fi, a noir romantic love story between Neo and Trinity, but not so much the bullet time ballet that defined the franchise.The Matrix Resurrections, moves more like a theater play that pays homage to an event, than the movie it pretends to be.If you're interested in the film's proposal, I think you'll appreciate it. But if you're from the everything is woke crowd, or you're just interested in reliving the original Matrix, you'll probably leave this movie disappointed.I am sure this film will be reviewed and dissected thousands of times. And a lot of people will hate the movie, others like me will appreciate the frankness.I enjoyed the film for what it is, and not for what I expected it to be. It was nice visiting old friends, and yeah, they're older.",
2772,"They had 3 films to figure out what works and what doesn't. They failed to recapture what worked from original (a masterpiece), instead it felt like they were taking the mick.First of all, it just doesn't feel like the Matrix. Apart from the green tint effect being removed in this version of the Matrix, the characters, the music, pretty much everything just didn't feel right.They nerfed Neo's character and didn't give Trinity enough time to shine (I expected her character development, but it was poorly executed). The fight scenes were so poorly done. The originals ( and even sequels to some extent) were well choreographed, this film just consisted of throw everyone in a room and have a brawl. I can't explain how frustrated I am with what I've just watched. Such a disappointment, It could have been really awesome.",4
2773,"I like this film.It's different from the trilogy, not so important and full of information like the other three but it's good.For me it's the perfect final for Matrix. I hope this will be the last film about Matrix.",7
2774,"This is something that was not supposed to happen. The storyline is kind of the same of previous movies, but some actions and characters were useless. It looks like some actors from Sense 8 were promised a role in a more important movie. The acting of the 2 old and major characters is bad. Neo looks like a retarded human being trying to talk dumb and slow.",4
2775,"This film is really kind of a mixed bag. I feel confident about the rating that I have assigned to this film but I'm mostly going to talk about my personal criticisms.I actually really liked the concept of the story, I do think they could have done a much better job at wrapping things up, especially when you consider all the new story elements that were introduced going into this film.There are also small moments throughout the film where there is a struggle to feel naturally immersed into the tone of a scene.Sometimes a dramatic situation is unfolding but it doesn't feel convincing, I'm talking about a situation looking so unnatural that you end up getting shifted into a stage-theatre viewing perspective, becoming aware that they're actors/actresses trying to play characters, acting out a situation.Every issue I've stated above is really unique &amp; did not exist so enormously when compared to the previous matrix movies, all of which I love &amp; rate highly.It just feels like the matrix resurrections wasn't planned out with the care &amp; effort that it deserved. It felt like I watched the work of someone smart who had a great idea for a story but was ultimately trying to rush their assignment during the filming stages.",6
2776,"Indeed it is difficult to maintain a good sequel, but the writers did it!I really really liked the The Matrix Resurrections.Good job boys and girls! You have managed to capture the intelligent audience again!",10
2777,"I was entertained and engaged the entire time of the movie. I loved every minute of it. If you love Matrix and Neo and Trinity, you'll love it. I got goosebumps.",10
2778,"I was 18 when The Matrix was released, saw it release night at the Las Vegas west wind drive in theater, nerded out about it for many many months, got a job at blockbuster basically because of this movie. When it finally got released on video I had to try and describe to customers what this movie was about, made my day every time someone asked and usually if I really tried to explain it, they would just walk away saying too sci-fi, too confusing ext etc, so eventually I would just say Just watch it pay attention and you will love it, oh and I met my wife there 21 years ago so there's that, so maybe a little biased 😂 anyways, it brought back good memories, I had goose bumps through the entire movie, it's fun and if you're a 90s kid or just enjoyed the trilogy as a whole, not many of us lol I think you will enjoy it as much as I did.P/s It's a little goofy lol and rough around the edges but I never thought we would get another one of these movies so I'm happy 😊",8
2779,I was so excited to see this movie and I'm leaving the theatre so disappointed. Self-indulgent and utterly bereft of any new material.*spoilers below*the 'focus group' and 'workshops' in the early scenes of the movie we're essentially what I imagine the writers thought would be a very clever way to bring a new audience up to date. This turned out to be patronising and treated the audience like idiots as they explained the various interpretations of the earlier Matrix Trilogy to us.Neo and Trinity. Will they won't they? Will they escape the matrix? Will they get together (again)? Will they fly? Will they save humanity? Ergh. Nothing new.Disobedient ship captain. Check.Smug super-program that has a plan within a plan within a trap within a puzzle within a catastrophic truth. Check.Agent Smith. Check.fight scenes in rain. Check.ok I take it back...machines that support humanity. So maybe that's the only thing that's new.Could have been explored a lot more but screen time was devoted to a rehash of the matrix.,2

Is this talking about gulping down a blue or red pill, or does it refer to surrendering at least ten bucks and three hours of your one life to live to MATRIX RESURRECTIONS? ""Return to the source.""

2785,"How anyone can give this movie more than 2 stars is beyond me.I guess it must be the new, raised-on-half-quality-story-telling and oblivious generation.This movie is just a big mess of all the old ideas.An attempt to make all the movies into one.Directing is all over the place.Dialog non consistent.Screenplay gives no play or connection to the characters.The old movies where heavily founded in a close relationship and empathy for the characters. The story-telling was exquisit!Things happened for a reason, and where well explained, to the detailed level. The balance of plot-twists and wondering in awe was perfect.Effects were there for a reason, and were pretty woven into the fabric of te whole plot.The first Matrix movie blew the mind.This movie blew my faith in Hollywood and the future of movies to come.This movie is shallow, chaotic plot-wise, and the effects are there only for the effects sake, exept for a couple of sequences.Characters are trying to play tough, totally un-motivated.Even the fade out song, a wannabe-tough COVER song of Rage Against the Machines epic song is made a mockery.Hollywood!!??!What are you??Teenagers?This is what happens when over-confident directors, and greed takes over a good idea and universe.I hate to say this, but this movie I will never speak of again.",2
2786,What to say... nostalgia and a beautiful reboot of a classic trilogy! Highly recommended 10/10 and i can't say good enough things about this movie everything about it just brought back all the feels!,10
2787,"Despite some rabid bad reviewers, and even some fair criticisms, I rather enjoyed this film.I also went into this without high expectations.What made the very first Matrix was some never-seen-before cutting edge film effects technology, and the 2 following films rode on the coat tails of that, doing fairly well without really adding much other than playing out the ancient old Messiah story in the Matrix universe.This new version was fun. It didn't really explore any new ground, introduce new effects, but, it let us revisit a universe we loved, and, I'm pretty sure it's not nearly as bad as some folks knee-jerk bombing it want to claim.Keanu is also the best everything. Negging on any work he's part of is just bad juju. Keanu's success is all of our success, and with the last several years being the dumpster fire it's been, we need more light, and more Keanu, even if it doesn't live up to some folks' expectations.",10
2788,"I'm just going to forget this movie ever came out...it's easier that way. Literally, the only good thing about this movie was Neil Patrick Harris!Side note, Neo is no longer the one, because he has been replaced...or maybe there is now the two?",1
2789,How could someone present this after the trilogy.... What group of people could release this abomination? I have never been angrier about a movie. Such a failure.,1
2790,"I'll say this sequel was very entertaining and kept me engaged the entire movie. It started out confusing but got clearer and clearer and as it went on and was captivating throughout. I like how they have a tied in classic footage of the ""The Matrix"" and characters to link the past with the present. The French character for the 2nd Matrix was a surprise to seen and Fast forwarding 60 years into the future was a nice twist. And for all these bad reviews what were these reviewers hoping for or expecting I don't get it. Loved the music too. If they were disappointed that the break out of Neo from his own people wasn't dramatic enough, they would have needed to make the movie longer and today with all the short attention spans of young people.",9
2791,"Not sure what everyone's issue is. These 4And 5 star reviews remind me of that South Park guy that sits at his computer LOL Too much dialogue? When? What is wrong with everybody.It checked all the boxes for me as a longtime Matrix fan.-Entertaining action, cast and story flow-Great songs-Same fantastical type of storyline so what?-Perfect acting, nobody stood out as a weak actor-Perfect casting honestly, everybody fit their role-Groff was incredible. He commands the 'psycho' karate vibes very well-Wardrobe once in the Matrix was so epic. Bet it was all the gang's favorite shoot day because they looked hot-I still believed in their love, how many years later-I was made to FEEL a lot of things, not only about the state of the world today (and how plugged in we all act) but about their love story which I haven't revisited in over a decade. The fact I was made to care again in a couple hours- bravo-New Morpheus is cool as hell, believable and great fight choreo-The fact that Henrick is now redeemed in my book from formerly being an obnoxious Sand Snake is just pure gold; she was amazing as BugsSidebar on plastic surgery - Keanu and Carrie have led humble enough lives that they could be ""normally"" aged actors in this film, instead of the bloated Botox faces we see. Refreshing and rare to see normal graceful aging.I loved the Matrix then and loved it tonight. All cherry here.",10
2792,"Should of did a fan service like Spiderman and bring back all the actors. They nailed it. This missed it's mark. Mediocre dialogue, didn't bring back iconic actors, bad cgi. This just isn't it chief.",5
2793,"If I weren't a Keanu Reeves fan, I would've foregone this too long 2hr and 28 min booboo with its garbage dialogue..or was it comedy?I kind of wanted it to hurry up, get to the meat and potatoes, and be over.I needed more Kung-fu, long black coats, shades and maybe an extra steamy love scene.I miss FishburneThe new Morpheous is a joke.Blue haired Bugs???Half way in still no Trinity..not Tiffany...Trinity.Nairobi was made to be too old.Too many other celebrities, although Neil Patrick was a good bad guy and Mrs. Jonaswas pretty good too.Overkill on the binaryDirecting sucked..no true dramatic points..N and T meeting for the 1st time..the taking of the red pill.And the ending....what????Anywho I'm disappointed and done!",5
2794,I was ready to watch a movie with a silly story but full of visuals. Even the visuals in this movie is nothing compared to the first three. This movie doesn't have anything special.,5
2795,"I was expecting so much from this movie but it was disappointing. No story, no sense. Half of the movie I thought that it was a documentary about making the matrix. The love between Neo and Trinity was nothing more than flat. I think the hormonal therapy is not the key to the good movie directing.",2
2796,"Look it's not my favorite matrix, that will always be the original, you can't catch lightning in a bottle twice. That movie changed a lot and trying to think a sequel can be better than the original is foolish as it's only happened a handful of times in the history of cinema. But I will say it's definitely my new second favorite. I didn't hate the sequels like some people did, I just didn't like the overuse of cgi when it wasn't there and the cave rave. I really enjoyed the new lore and where they went with it. Was I initially onboard with the new Morpheus? Not really... but now after it had time to settle and I understood what he really was I moved on knowing he wasn't supposed to be our Morpheus. While I think people are justified in saying they overused the meta commentary. It wasn't a big issue for me, they could have scaled it back a bit but I thought it was entertaining. Honestly I really enjoyed the concepts they went with in how they controlled neo and kept all the things that made him, well him, close by. And I liked how they stayed true to the love story of trinity and neo the core of the story. Having the Merovingian and Sati back was awesome. Specifically Sati as she was a big part of the end of the original trilogy and I'm glad they didn't leave that plot thread dangling forever. The new crew were great, especially Bugs and Sheaperd. I really liked how some of the machines, humans, and programs were now working together. I could honestly go on for a while but I'll just say if you really liked the themes, story and characters and lore of the original trilogy and animatrix, you'll love this movie. If you only like the first movie and hated everything after it this movie likely isn't for you. It's more than just an action movie, it was always and original live action anime at heart and this isn't any different. It's about connection and love and accepting who you really are, with a lot of ""Kung fu"" and bullet time mixed in. Wish I could tell Lana how thankful I am and I hope they finish this new story so we can see where the rabbit takes us.",10
2797,"It's difficult to introduce a new Matrix movie when the ""cat's out of the bag"" so to speak after three movies that explained in more than enough detail the goings on in the Matrix universe. The intrigue and mystery of the original Matrix movie is what made it so compelling, and I feel Matrix IV has been able to achieve this near-impossible task.The movie starts slowly and makes the viewer doubt everything they think they know and expect. The story of ""the one"" is then spun to a new level and the end result is highly satisfying.",10
2798,"To the ones who watched Wachowskis Sense8, this will make sense. Do you remember the HUGE wink to the fans during the film? Well, this feels the same. To all those who trash this movie here, it's ok, you just don't get it. You probably expected to be mind blown like you were in the first Matrix, but this wasn't intended to be that. This was intended to reunite our (the REAL fans) beloved characters while laughing about this film actually being made. So please, if you are not a true fan, no need for your dissing just because you don't get the humor or irony of this movie. For me, just watching them a little bit, the matrix characters and also the sense8 cast which was absolutely awesome and nostalgic, is a treat. Letting all of them comeback on the screen and collab with Lana was a delight. So happy to see all those good, loving actors back together again.Hope all you harsh critics out there, take a step back from your condescendence and realize you are just not getting it. Understandable, it's hard feeling stupid and missing the point.",10
2799,"The first Matrix movie was different and amazing. The two sequel movies I didn't really care for, and haven't watched them since they came out. This movie might be a tad bit better than the two sequels, but I doubt I'll be watching this again either. I wished Laurence Fishburne and Hugo weaving would have been in this movie playing Morpheus and agent Smith. Is this movie good ? NO. Is this the worst movie I've seen in recent years? NO, that would be Brittany Runs a Marathon.",5
2800,"The Matrix (the first one) is a great film: inventive, truly one of the best twists in cinema (in the first act!) that re-invented the action film genre. Resurrections aims to revisit the idea and ultimately it fails.The film is so reverential that it is almost a museum piece - it it like a Comicon whistlestop tour of every Matrix trope we can remember. We get it. But the film itself has been sacrificed on the altar of nostalgia so what we get it an introspective three act yarn that muddles along at it's own pace trying to hit plot points to keep someone happy (not sure who).The biggest problem with this film is the writing. They should have just said goodbye to Neo and Trinity and gone full bore new matrix and gone a bit crazy, done something different and tried to surprise us. The new cast look like a lot of fun and could have done something new that would have been in the spirit of the original.All in all: it's a bit rubbish.",4
2801,"This was cool to see just for the fact that it Exists...to see Another Matrix movie after all this time And with the 2 leads is definitely worth a 7 in my book!Thing is ,it really Lacks so much of what made the original matrix and even the original trilogy pretty awesome, and mindbending...You cant catch lightening in a bottle twice... even once, as in the case of the 1st movie, was a once in a Great while occurrence and thats why its remembered so fondly by so many..You Cant have a matrix movie Without the Real Smith or without the Real Morpheous! Those characters Made the film complete and play off of our 2 leads...Keannu and Carrie ann cannot do it alone, its like yin and yang with half missing...Sure there are replacement actors Reprising the roles but those characters are Irreplaceable...It would be like trying to make a matrix movie with keanu and carrie ann absent... Not gonna float.... that said, This movie is slow in its 1st half, then gets revved up in true matrix fashion in the later parts..Galant effort and one thats appreciated by any Matrix fan just becuz someone took the time and effort to Try to reprise it and continue it.... The Real matrix experience though is in the original Trilogy... watch those again and prepare to still have ur mind blown becuz they stand up ,even today after all these yrs as something rare, special and Unique.",7
2802,"Not a fan of all these new age movies \ where females are super and all the hero's like Rey in Star Wars , Kate bishop in Hawkeye ... now trinity and this new Asian chick saves the day ... movie was a disappointment .... Even the remake of the famous song done at ending credits was redone by a woman ... even the directors are refine by woman lol.",3
2803,"Seems as though everyone became a nihlist compared after all of the existential crisis' they faced through the trilogy. Neo said he didnt want to fight anymore and if he had to reenter the Matrix to save Trinity he would. They didnt even know if she wanted to leave anyway. Even Naiobi was like ""Why are you here?""The side kick robots were too Jar Jar Binks like and none of the other characters were given enough time to be developed. Amazing considering the run time.The flashbacks were awkward and the Morpheus and Mr Smith character actors missed. Was it too hard to call Neo ""Mr Anderson""?For us fanatics, I think we got a Ghostbusters 2016. If you are a casual fan, it wont make sense.",3
2804,"I really think that the director of this movie literally went to The Matrix, and thought that this would be a good idea and somehow came back with the wrong script.Lucky for us (the ones in the real world), can let things go graciously. Sadly, for The Matrix saga this isn't the case.Boring script, Soooooo boriiiiing!!! I finished the movie just for respect to Keanu and Carrie-Ann ( that's why I give this one 2 stars) since clearly is not their fault to be working for a director who only cares about how much money could get from it, instead of leaving it just like it was and not join the new era of ""bring back to destroy any project that was good and successful at its time just for the money"".Lana, shame on you. Only one thing left to say is, that I wish we could reset The Matrix and go back to the beginning... at least some of us need to forget this happened :(",2
2805,"I do not know what are you all guys smoking, this was great!I am a serious Matrix Fan. I had watched all the Matrix movies over and over again, I know every line. I went to see this movie with very low expectations, thinking it was going to be a disaster. Oh boy was I wrong.For starters I thought this movie was going to be filled with LGBTQ+ material since the director/producer is called herself a woman. I am against LGBTQ+ material inside movies and I think it is destroying hollywood, I'm so glad to see that the movie is honoring it's characters, the story and the flow between them more than trying to impose an ideology into it's viewers.Cinematic wise it is beautifully crafted, the score is also amazing and a perfect blend for what is happening on the movie. The fight scenes are weaker than the trilogy but acceptable. Most of all, the movie is more script oriented with more lines, more dialogue and more message in it than all the trilogy combined.I heard people is complaining that this movie is the Matrix devoid of serious meaning, less gritty and more fun. I tend to agree and that is not a bad thing.Watching the trilogy is hard, those movies are far too serious and pretty dark, it makes watching them difficult, something you cannot do all at once as you will get tired pretty fast.This movie is more about what happens next and it doesn't pretend to repeat the same formula, I do not see any intend on making it as a cash grab and it is not trying to bring us the image of the savior again, instead, it is shaped to show our current society weaknesses and bring some hopes into it.It is less dark than the trilogy? Hell yes. Is it that a bad thing?. Hell no!!The movie is more inspiring, has a deep and honest goal and it's more fun to watch than the trilogy, I wish the fight scenes were as good as Matrix Reloaded, which for me is the best movie action-related but the script and lines given and the actual goal is more interesting in Resurrections than in the Trilogy.The unification of all the previous concepts on the Matrix is also here and I like this new world much more so than the previous one.Hats off to all the team. I did my best not to like this movie but I just couldn't. I now have faith that good cinema is still possible coming from hollywood.Maybe people is pissed off at Lana that she didn't bring any LGBTQ+ theme into the movie?. Guess what, doing a GOOD movie is what defines a good director, not promoting an agenda. Maybe that is why everyone is hating it.",8
2806,"The first movie was amazing... the second one ok... the third one I accepted because it was a sequel and it deserved an end .....but why on earth did they made this one?At the beginning I was enjoying... I understood the reason and why Neo had to get back to the matrix...but then the entire movie turns out to be just a creepy love story.Why the woman now has superpowers? I tell you why.......this world now ........you must empower woman somehow even if it doesn't make sense, I'm a woman and I thought it was ridiculous.I agree with the other review that is doubting if Wachowskis really wrote the script of the first Matrix or stole it.... certainly, it looks like that.",5
2807,"If you can honestly admit that the original Matrix movie was indeed an iconic masterpiece of cinema and everything else the Wachowskis did after that was mediocre at best, then you will.get my reference to Carl Douglas' ONLY real contribution to the arts was the catchy Kung fu fighting. Similarly, this latest offering is a terrible attempt to cash in on the original, with plenty of flashbacks to it throughout. Terrible concept and execution - I'm surprised Keanu agreed to return. The new characters replacing the originals just flopped too. Who picked morpheus' wardrobe?!! Wachowskis should retire - they have nothing original left to offer. (But thanks for the original) I've given a generous six because it was nice to see Neo opposite Trinity again but overall the film is mega boring and a rehash of the original trilogy.",6
2808,A true disappoinment. Waste of money and time. I would better stay home and be together with my family.I know something for sure; there'll be no Matrix 5 !!!,2
2809,"I wanted to like this film. I really did. However, as YouTube reviews have already proven, the majority of fans didn't like this film. I won't repeat all the points they've already made, but I'll share my two-cents as to why it was bad: I think Lana tanked it on purpose. WB was going to make this film with or without Wachowski involvement, and that's not cool. So, I think she may have jumped onboard to make something that would check all the Hollywood exec checkboxes (nostalgia, humor, cuteness, possibility for more movies, etc.), yet very purposefully wouldn't resonate with fans. Better to destroy your own universe than let it be stolen, I guess...",2
2810,The plot execution could have been better but I loved the direction and decisions they made with the world. So many questions from the original trilogy felt satisfyingly answered and more. Only complaint was the martial arts and action scenes were janky. I was looking forward to the homage of Hong Kong style like previous matrix films it was just quick cuts and a misuse of Keanu's skills.,8
2811,How the heck did we end up here? I dont even know where to start. Well lets see the new actros: the new Morpheus is the bigest joke ever. From a stable and respectable figure we went to a wannabe slick clown. The story went from something serious to a japanese teen movie. The special effects were better in the first movie as they are now when we have all this strong computers and graphic processors. It is really bad 👎 😔,3
2812,"As I was sitting here ready to write a missive filled with details and examples of why this was such a pile of garbage I realized that its not worth it. If you enjoy mindless fun with explosions and generally decent fight scenes then you will probably enjoy this film. If you care at all about the story of the original, characters, writing, dialogue, Morpheus, Agent Smith, Neo, Trinity or Jack Sparrow then you will likely hate this movie. It was not a Matrix movie. It was a stupid movie with a stupid plot and a stupid story and a stupid beginning, middle and end. It was an embarrassment of a movie and I am now convinced that the Wachowskis hired someone else to write the original script to the Matrix.",1
2813,"Unfortunately, there are too many reused scenes and styles from the original Matrix to my taste. Flashbacks are ok if they are needed, but to completely vampirize the original movie is somewhat of a cope out. Should have made it an original on it's own.The storyline is quite boring and in my opinion felt more like a TV show story than what a 2.5 hours movie should have been. The movie is not well executed, it's devoid of an interesting story. Unless you spend 10 episodes on the subject of Neo and his emotional issues, this was kind of a waste of time.The special effects are really good, amazingly good. And it's the Matrix. So I can't bring myself to give it lower than 6/10 but to be honest, this is about a 5. So disappointed.",6
2814,I loved the first three films but this was a mish mash of a film - disjointed and certainly nothing like the first movies.Sometimes it is better to just move on. I do not think i could watch this again. The first three films are great and very watchable.,3
2815,"I thought this movie was really good. I loved it. I think the writing is going to fly over most peoples heads and they are going to miss a lot of the brilliance and depth of it. Watch Matrix Explained on You Tube and you will see how deep all these movies are. I felt like the characters were weaker in this though, the villian's could of been better, and it was a tragedy Lawerence Fishbourne was not playing morpheous. But I was glued to my tablet watching this and would really recommend it, the ending was weak but I think they will be making more movies. The music was incredible. The writing is the strongest point for me. Neo and Trinity did great and excellent CGI.",10
2816,"Sadly its a level of a Marvel flick.The clue is there - one of a dialog line says Warner Bros will do a reboot of Matrix, with original director - or without :) Guess 'without' it would be worse.",6
2817,"I'm not sure why this movie was made. The story is really, really bad. The characters stink and nothing happens. It felt like a movie made during a pandemic. I think they used so many scenes from the previous films because there isn't much of a movie here. The movie even makes fun of itself talking about the matrix.",4
2818,"Predictable writing, knew the ending well before it happened. Propped up by puns and nostalgic references. It almost felt like it took the Mickey out of the previous films which are treasured memories. Spoon fed what the matrix was for an hour so that millennials can join the franchise. Clearly a set up for a reboot, which I won't watch unless free on Netflix. Remember when you did something as a kid and it was amazing for example your old favourite rollercoaster, then you do it again as an adult and it's underwhelming.. that's the new matrix ""reboot""",4
2819,"The storyline and new ideas were pretty good. Most of the acting was pretty good. However the execution was pretty poor. None of the fight sequences had the wow-factor, the sharpness or intensity of the original films. It's almost like the special effects have gone backwards! Also the more colourful visuals didn't compare well with the original goth black.Overall it's worth watching for completeness but is far behind the original.",6
2820,I am not sure why they needed to make this part. It was really not needed at all. It's in bad to worst category which ever way you take it from cinematography to casting to story line etc. It's love story and told in a first possible manner.,3
2821,"As others have said: it is that bad!The resurrection story of main characters is just lame, every few minutes you see scenes from older Matrix movies, characters are not likable at all, fight scenes are a joke...And Neo doesn't really fight. No, now he goes full Jedi mode because... reasons?No more Hugo Weaving with his famous and scary ""Mr. Anderson"" when he talks with Neo.No, now we have new mellow Smith that says ""Tom""; I am NOT kidding. I just couldn't connect this new character to Smith because of that, just feels unnatural.Don't watch it in cinema, watch at home where you can fast-forward it. T5 and T6, as bad as they are, are still far better sequels than this movie.",1
2822,"I thought the movie was not going to manage to make it to the end in a decent manner. But, the last 30 minutes or so proved me wrong. Not that the acting had gotten any better, but somehow, the story found the way out.I was still disappointed though.",6
2823,"I feel bad for this review as Keanu Reves is a legend and the Matrix franchise has been outstanding until this Resurrection !! Absolute rubbish.The long awaited return that's left so many and myself disappointed, it's a shadow of the first movie. I wish I hadn't seen it as it's spoiled the remarkable masterpieces of the the first three movies for me,What were the Wachowskis thinking ???",3
2824,I have always been a fan of the original Matrix Trilogy and this one is no different.I loved it.I had seen all the critics and fans reviews saying it was crap and I am glad I waited for the hype to fade away and watched it via streaming at home.I loved all the alleged meta references that helped pay homage to the original trilogy.It feels like the best effort I have seen to make a franchise out of a trilogy.I cannot wait for more to come.,10
2825,"None of the other matrix had this silly comedy tone, why do that in this one ?There is an ignorant producer to blame in this mess for sure, trying to reach the generation of ""youtube/tik tok"" they made something that can't be included in the 7th Art, its trash.",1
2826,"Lana did a good job. A wickedly entertaining, delightfully romantic addition to the Matrix and it was about both of them Neo and Trinity. It is the new beginning with new crew members and another cat along with a small post credit scene ""The Catrix"".",6
2827,"I think they would bring something new and make history again as a first Matrix. I hoped for that.However, I have the feeling that they were sure about the script, and it was necessary to take back various shorts from the original trilogy.They tried to condense the trilogy into one movie, and they got lost.They want to say that Neo isn't the One after all. Instead, they bring some gender agenda to tell that women can be the One. No problem to me if a woman was the One, I'm ok with that, but they attempt to erase Neo's character just blown away all the charisma that brings up with the actor.They had time to do this? Seriously? A philosophical history such as Matrix needs time to be told, not in a rush when several things are happening simultaneously.I still hope they will do some interesting with this resurrection stuff. Fingers crossed.",5
2828,LOVED IT. Been a Matrix fan since the original and I really enjoyed this. Perfect addition and continuation of the mythology. Let's see more of Neo and Trinity!!!,10
2829,Wow. What a disappointment. Any film which constantly shows clips from the old movies all the way through the film is questionable. No new ideas and felt like a fan made YouTube movie but with big budget special effects. I was a massive fan of the originals so I'm gutted. They missed a massive opportunity with this. Money grab.Even if it comes out on a streaming platform save yourself 2 hrs.,4
2830,"The 4th installment of the Matrix was disappointing. About half way through the movie I fell asleep, napped for a couple of hours, and finished the chore of watching this film. This is not a knock on the actors and actresses, but the plot felt lazy and the action sequences were far less than what I expected.Instead of calling it Matrix: Resurrections, they should have called it Matrix: Neo and Friends. This film was like a mashup of Blade: Trinity (no pun intended to Carrie-Ann Moss's character) and Wes Craven's a New Nightmare. To elaborate, it was like a self - aware movie that seems to center as much on the sidekicks as it does the lead actor.I do not regret watching it, but I do not look forward to watching it again. I think I will take the blue pill and continue to live as if I have seen only the original trilogy. I don't know if this movie sucked because it was missing one of the Wachowski's input and idea or what, but this movie was not any fun.",4
2831,"RATED 6/10Language: EnglishTotal misfire. Unwanted and unforgivable sequel. The first half is full of repeated scenes of earlier parts and the second half is older character revelation from the earlier parts....There is nothing original in this one, the actions are so bland, dialogs praising the old franchise and very poor writing.Keanu continued the looks of John wick, thats another irritating thing, sometimes i felt like watching john wick...Total disappointment.",6
2832,"It's just plain awful. The original movie is rehashed and the plot points repeated with new and less interesting characters. There is a total absence of creativity, novel ideas, and good acting. In fact, the movie is so uninspiring that even as I'm writing this it's still playing on my TV because there's an hour left to go and I got bored. I feel bad turning it off before the movie is finished only because I loved the original so much. But I guess reading the reviews will keep me entertained for the last hour.",2
2833,Disgrace to the whole franchise of Matrix. Such a respectable franchise did a lot of damage bringing this 4th part back. Highly unnecessary and stretched to a point where everything looked and seemed redundant. This is the worst movie I have watched this year.,2
2834,"Matrix literally resurrected in every possible way with this installment and what a superb resurrection it is. Every actor performed well in this movie even the extras. It was like seeing good old friends as soon as Keanu and Carrie-Anne were on screen. A good balance of suspense, humor, sarcasm and bunch of new concepts and ideas, which can be used for further continuation of the franchise. The CGI and special effects were well done, they look upgraded but also felt familiair with previous movies. The dialogues were well written and flowed surprisingly well. All in all it was a good fun ride and a welcome treat!",9
2835,"Hell, this producer/director can't even spell her own name. Ya, a pass. There is no Wachowski for Lana, period. It is Wachowska no matter what. Ridiculous.Not even asking one of the iconic actors for this? Give us a break. Do something else!Enough said. But ye, Hollywood as always , milk the plebs for money and no doubt it will bag a lot.Just can't imagine this being worth spending on.Maybe some good sci-fi is out soon though.",1
2836,"Matrix has always been our reality. The movie has lost its deeper truths as it has transitioned as one more trendy product of our world making its original ideas morph into banalities. It makes perfect sense then that the very existence of this movie is so unecessary but generated by another meaningless fad that rules our reality that makes us ""happy"" an unaware of our lack of freedom and hence the objective is perfectly accomplished by making no more than an action and romance movie that even has a failed cartoonish copy of its original actors because now it's devoid of meaning and it doesn't matter.This meta realities in the end are the matrix itself, we are subjected by our own ideas about ideas.Amazing!",10
2837,"It felt like 3/4 of the movie was talking, good lord was it boring.Hollywood love to dig up old heroes, put their corpse in a dress, add some makeup. Gah, so disapointed.",2
2838,"Lord help me where do I start?!I was sat in my IMAX cinema seat ( having paid over £18 for a ticket!) literally squeeing with excitement when the green titles and familiar music came on.... Awaiting the most exciting sequel of my little lifetime...And that is exactly where it ended.No amazing screen exploding entrance a la Trinity in Reloaded....No slap-you-round the chops introduction to new EXCITING characters that left you with your mouth open, drooling....No amazing new fighting techniques or CGI... ITS BEEN 20 YEARS!!!! For the love of all that is Neo I've seen better quality video games!!The God awful two dimensional new characters that were introduced to us were about as convincing as Mr Tumble!! The unnecessary revamp of old characters who brought nothing to movie ( MAJOR missed opportunity with the Merovingian and who the f was Smith played by?!) There was no depth or passion, no fight, no real bond. The inconsistencies of the characters throughout the film were gobsmackingly painful to watch. And don't get me started on "" Morpheus"" I use that term loosely as the laughing stock they turned him into was nothing short of blasphemy.I was sat in my seat literally PRAYING that it was just a slow start and that my senses would be subjected to the well known mind blowing action from the past, but as time ticked on and I sank lower in my chair my heart sank with it. Keanu and Carrie-Anne did their best I believe in a devastatingly poorly written and executed low budget feeling movie.And for those crying, ""but it's a love story, it's not about the Matrix....bullsh!t. Their story IS the Matrix. You cannot make up for the abysmal lack of storyline in this movie, so many opportunities, so many directions it could have gone in, so many chances for a continuance of a once great trilogy.... Blasted out of the water by p!ss poor cinematography ( even the close ups on Carrie's face were awful) a world were no one dies now and once great characters are ridiculed and destroyed.Save your money, give it to the homeless instead.",1
2839,"Yes, I know the content of Matrix 1-3 - no, i do not praise Matrix as such.I do not feel compelled to write, but in this ""case of a bad flick"" I do.This is ridiculous at best, this is not a parody, but feels like the homework of a undertalented writer or writing crew that has no idea, what they are doing. Like all the ADHS unboxing-crews on YT doing ""somenting with that great Matrix""-thing, but lack the professionalism. Did not think, that I'd wirte that: It's a waste of time, ressources, money - and my viewingtime. Broken storyline with no sense, and well, Mr. Reeves and Mrs. Trinity way do outfit this bad moviemaking thing. Thanks but no thanks. Did not finish and left the theatre. Wont watch further.",2
2840,"Certain critic's review about The Matrix Resurrections, pushed me into reviews here. First couple sentences, he included a statement ""great action scenes"". I just can't, 3 days after watching it, stop wondering... ""What action scenes!?!?"".",5
2841,"Accept this for the campy trip it is supposed to be, be happy for the new generation that can enjoy a Matrix movie, and try to enjoy this romp with great visual effects. Also stay through the credits for a bonus scene - and if you like it or not, the Matrix probably will always return in one way or another ...",4
2842,"For me, as a fan since childhood, The Matrix Resurrections was everything I wanted it to be. 9/10 with some awesome twists and visuals and of course.. Kung Fu!Ok this needs to be said.. the real reason this movie is getting low scores is because dudes cannot FATHOM that Lily and Lana are trans and therefore were submitting their low scores the second it was available. GET OVER IT. The movie rocks and Lana rocks and shows her talent yet again.. and for the record, I didn't see a single trans person or metaphor in the movie, maybe I'm missing it, but this movie was about Neo and Trinity first and foremost and they pulled it off!",9
2843,"Such a waste of what could have been a great addition... we expected a black lesbian wheelchair user and got a blue haired Asian lesbian, so I guess Hollywood lived up to their reputation.",3
2844,"It's starts well then it is dragged till the predictable end. Why? I have no idea. Still if you're a fan you have to watch it, just for the closure, and to see what happened after chapter 3. The acting, directing and action is sloppy except the young actors who are putting an effort.",6
2845,"I enjoyed it, it had action, I enjoyed Neil Patrick Harris character, the fight scenes were good, not great, just good. I just wish it was more fight scenes with Neo and Trinity, the character Bugs was good. I give it a 7/10 it's not as bad as everyone is saying. I love the chemistry between Neo and Trinity. I would say atleast give it a chance, I watched the movie, and I'm glad I did.",7
2846,"I always liked the trilogy overall, the latter parts probably more than most people despite some of the nonsense in Revolutions in particular. I would've been more surprised than not if a sequel didn't appear eventually.So, here it is, then. And... well, it could've been worse, but it definitely could've definitely been better as well. I do reckon it is weaker than even Revolutions, though rating Revolutions on its own is a bit tricky for me.The film starts rather slowly. I must say it feels like a bit of a slog for a good while. It is somewhat of a similar ""setup"" as in the first film, but takes much longer to get going. The overall story isn't exactly all that surprising, treading a lot of old ground instead. Expected, but unfortunate when true to this extent.One issue is also that there seems to be a bit of a lack of memorable characters. This continues throughout the film. The ""replacements"" for old cast members are forgettable, and especially a certain ex-agent just... doesn't even try to evoke the feeling of the original character. The way the possessed ""Bane/Smith"" did in the original trilogy, for example. Both of these two end up feeling pointless additions. The entirely new characters don't get much treatment either. Little backstory or anything, even if what little acting they do get to do is okay. There's also Niobe, who's also decent but very different (but hey, at least it's still Jada), and also a fourth sort-of-familiar face who I fully expected to appear... and did. (Talking of appearances, there are a bunch of ""flashbacks"" to the trilogy, which in a way perhaps fit story-wise but on the other felt a bit annoying.)With the other cast out of the way, that then leaves us with Neo &amp; Trinity. The latter gets much less screen time. Both performances are actually fairly good, though the characters definitely have changed. But that was to be expected two decades later, and given the story setup.Finally, the main item of Matrix movies generally speaking - the action. I think this was probably the most disappointing aspect. It wasn't bad, but it was quite tame compared to the trilogy, lacking a lot of what made it cool. Quite basic and uninspired stuff, really. Action movie scenes have come a long way especially for melee fights since the trilogy, and while the trilogy still holds up (at least to me), here we - or at least I - are left wanting. Though one thing that still remains much the same is that no one can shoot worth a damn. Oh, perhaps worth mentioning that the imposing agents from the trilogy are basically gone. For whatever reason they are replaced by what are basically just mindless zombies. Just... why?In summary we are left with a passable but uninspired effort. In typical fashion the ending definitely leaves open the option for more movies, but whether that happens or not is anyone's guess, and obviously also affected by how the movie performs with audiences and the box office. Despite my less than glowing review personally I wouldn't say no to another go, because if nothing else the ending does provide for the possibility of getting more of that juicier kind of action. Though there is the valid question of where to go with the story that doesn't just do more retreading of old ground.",6
2847,"Michael Scott from The Office screaming ""NO!"" over and over. That is the experience you are going to have watching this movie if you love the first film.",3
2848,"Well it was kind of what I expected with only half of the brothers, now sisters having a go. Clearly two minds would have been better than one. The first rule of storytelling is show don't tell and this mediocre rehash was all telling and very little showing. Almost like some manifesto of my theory of everything. I expected some virtue signalling and some gender identity politics but without a coherent well structured storyline it was just trying to fit too much dribble into a second rate story. I hope they stop here because it's barely worth the paper it was written on. Well I hate to be right but go watch the other three movies again snd stop there!",4
2849,"I get what Lana and the other writers were driving at. It's thematically about rebellion, in part against the misunderstood themes of the earlier movies, and in the broader sense against authority and against those who would steal choice from us, including those who would rather mire in mediocrity, fear, desire.But there's some story beats that don't work in the context of one film, even if the action is entertaining, the meta references provide meat, and the acting is competent. Stand out performances by Keanu, Carrie, Patrick and Jessica btw.The relative powerless of Neo throughout the entire film in some senses, is an odd fit. So is the sudden powerfulness of trinity at the end, despite no focus on her. Perhaps there's some untold story there.I liked the 'am I crazy' trippiness, and the tireless battle against fate, animal desire/fear and control. If I were to offer constructive advice for any probable future films, given WB's position - dig into Camus and Lao Tzu for philosophical rebellion, and into Jung for a descent into the depths of the psyche, and draw deep on the thing that's clearly driving your creative juices right now - create a psychedelic 'rage against the machine'. And don't be afraid to go big with the action - a lot of viewers get drawn in by that, it doesn't need to look _that_ gritty, and that will keep the studios wallets happy whilst you have your moment to speak.",6
2850,"The plot is dull an vague. Had no idea what was happening the whole time. There is no real conflict.Replacing Morpheus, agent smith, and the Frenchman was rough to watch.",1
2851,"Well, it was cool and good to see some familiar faces, get back to the story of Matrix again - concept that broke minds and change the movie scene forever. Originals were very unique in the way they were shot, along with the concept, story,etc.The bad...Well, this felt amateurish, more like a TV show script of the Covid times, with cut production budget. It just felt cheap. It felt like a Chinese counterfeit of a $5000 Luis Vuitton bag sold for $50 from a back of a truck. It smells the same,it looks the same,but it's far from the same... Acting was subpar to say the least. Directing was bellow average and cinematography was just ok. To be honest, it got bettter towards the middle. The first 1/3 of the movie felt like it was directed by someone whose only credit is directing high school theater,but then it got better to the B- rated movies.It felt like a money grab with very little depth, forgettable story with barely any beginning disappointing ending. The fight scenes were so cheap, it made B- rated movies shine. Reeves who obviously knows how to do fight scenes based on his last amazing movies as Mr Wick was not utilized and it felt like as an actor who never touched a gun in his life( yet he is VERY good at it not just in John Wick but real life too) I mean, again, cheap money grab. 5.7 are given mostly for the fact I enjoyed seeing the movie again but unlike the originals, I will never watch it again.",6
2852,This is .bad bad bad bad bad bad very bad this is is boring boring boring boring i slept in first hour i am serious whoever made this movie or product this movie deserves an award of the most boring movie of all time.,1
2853,"Oh boy, most importantly for me the movie seemed to have been color corrected as your life local channel blah news report , I just couldn't get past that fact, but story line took an even harder hit. MIV lacks character , all elements are all there, the special effects the costume design the magical Jefferson airplane theme song the actors the big shot producers and all that, but in the end it's just soulless and so unoriginal despite the fact the franchise was made by the same people.It would have been a great idea to just leave it the way it was in 1999, just perfect.And then, what's happened to Keanu reeves? He's on a roll with bad movies and bad performances.",5
2854,"Love the Matrix story, and respect Keanu and Carrie-Anne. I wanted to like this movie. I saw the reviews but decided to ignore them and went ahead to watch the movie with an open mind. Sorry, it was not possible to like it. I couldn't even finish it cause it was so bad.The fights are really bad performed, the dialogs and characters are cheesy and poor, they constantly repeat things, there is no original plot, cause they just took bits and pieces from previous movies and remixed them, and the makeup of the actors that should be old is really fake.I'm not sure if the director was maybe forced to make this sequel and she made is bad just on purpose. All in all, an extremely commercial productions that feels all wrong.",3
2855,I have never felt like an idiot at a movie just because the characters try to explain everything while they are doing nothing! Damn!I felled asleep 3 times/ non sense plot/ character development =0 / unnecessary cgi in avalanches.What was that??? I know what: all the good screenwriters went to HBO 20 years ago because they were underpaid.Don't waste 2:30h of your life.Just gave 4 stars because i've seen it in IMAX.Matrix Funerals should've been the correct title.,4
2856,"I admit it. I was a original fan of the Matrix series from the 2000s (i was born in 2000), but now that i see this new chapter of the saga i'm going to say this was a great extravaganza with music, action, funny scenes and also very sexy moments, Jessica Henwick included.Men, this girl is so frickin sexy, with Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, Gal Gadot, Kristen Stewart, and the other girls of the new cinema, and also a great actress. She use a bit of hotness for make better this movie, and you know what? I love a movie to see with funny, witty and cringe humor, but also comedy, no sad scenes and also funny characters, or secondary-type characters, for make more funny the movie.Please, ignore all the negative critics that make the movie ''unwatchable'' and go to see The Matrix Resurrection. You won't be regreted, because, admit the truth, did you like to go bed with her or, even better, with she and Priyanka Chopra?!Red pill or blue? The choice is yours.PS: Also love the feminist and transgender inclusion themes ;)",10
2857,Watched this and felt sad.....Watched batman begins and felt happy again👍More caracters needed so just enjoy the original trilogy where you get good dialogue and the action scenes exist and are watchable and brilliant.,4
2858,All Matrix including Animatrix had awesome soundtrack. This is a complete disaster :-(It's not really existing at all.The Movie itself had a hard start. The trilogy is basically completed. A fourth movie was not planned. The concept of the +/ - Battery with Neo and Trinity was somewhat okay. Smith changed to a babyface kind of Smith. Morpheus is somewhere 1/20 of the old one. Sad sad...,4
2859,"Way too busy.. even closeup dialogue shots distracting as soft focused backgrounds contain brighter focus points than the actual focal point, the actor. Silhouette fight scenes abound with choppy edits a la Bourne identity ( which was actually effective in a stylistic standard ) and even basics of continuity are thrown in the garbage where silhouette nothing characters are changing sides of frame and facing opposing ways repeatedly leaving the scenes throwaways and inconsequential for the most part.. shots are way too busy .. like way too busy.. overkill in everyscene.. Super dark and does not feel dynamic.. where foreground focal characters are lost to uber neon keylighting!? Stormtrooper aim on steroids here also where point blank automatic gun fire in confined spaces is unaddressed or even doged who cares right! At least they tried in the old ones! Hahhah.. in this we expect AT A BASE standard, the slick fight choreography of past matrices.. and c'mon even not top level just passable cinematography.. but they don't even provide that! Final scene shows fodder jumping out windows as makeshift kamakaze missiles which is a great analogy for the audiences mood at this point of the ""film"".. tries way too hard with insane additional Morpheus ( and multiple other NPCs like transforming bird robot!? ) who is now a ball bearing magnetic oscillation blah blah stfu..cast Neil Patrick Harris character actually says bullet time ROLL CREDITS.. that's the audiences word for it!! Not yours! Lol.. so many ""Who's this??"" Moments.. and plot black holes sucking in any semblance of suspension of disbelief into it.. original was groundbreaking this is just groundboring..Keanu looks like he got paid in peyote for this one.. for me as a viewer this was bullet time.. bullet to the brain time.. I want my 2.5 hours back..",1
2860,"I am not a cynic that doesn't give credit for the bravery Lana Wachowski showed here. In the first half, I was thinking I would behold the born of a cult. Good script, good humor, good concepts, good music. The problem starts when the noisy action starts. The movie suffers (I suppose) a restricted budget - let's remember we are in a post-Covid land, where movies are risky business. Because of that, the cinematography is amateur. I have to admit this movie is far away from the mastery displayed in the first one in this regard, but it is more intriguing than Reloaded and Revolutions. This time, we fell the digital recording cheapness and amateurism trying to hide behind the shaky camera. But we have to consider this movie is being misjudged since our expectations are bound to the impossible standards set by the first one. In a final statement, I liked the movie, it was a better and more adult experience than the average super-hero blockbuster of the month. Let's appreciate the work of people that are trying to create innovative content than praise the well succeed but predictable Disney-Marvel formula.",8
2861,"This film is a piece of s**t. It was so bad that I actually downloaded IMdb app to write it here. So stupid motivations, mixed with inappropriate jokes completely kills original Matrix atmosphere. Save your time, do not watch it. May be it will save Matrix from further remakes.",1
2862,"The whole film is like a cosplay of the original, 2 hrs of pain for any fan. It's keanu reeves being confused and using the force with some meta commentary on ""bullet time"".It's a good thing they copy and pasted about 15 mins of run time from the originals to remind you of when the franchise had credibility.",1
2863,Nice to the sense8 crew back in acton nice choice .Great action scenes but the story seemed to be trimmed.And full of holes I was left asking where didthe Smith character Go at the end ? Kind of made no sense the ending. Anyway worth the watch felt the movie story was cut to much .,6
2864,Wish this movie never happened. They should burn it before anyone watch it cause it will ruin all of the pervious matrix movies.The first 30min it's just like the director saying warmer bros made me do this and I didn't want it.Warner bros ruined Snyder's justice league movie and now matrix.Don't know which one is next.,1
2865,"For Matrix and Keanu fans this is still a fun outing, it's very much like the 20 year anniversary tour of that great album. The album was still great but the fizzle of that breaking idea isn't so sharp now, and the bands a bit older and obviously looking to capitalise on the good stuff. A few more philosophical threads with action that on some occasions came across as pedestrian, although there movie took a self aware approach. All in all I enjoyed it though and a nice revisit to the Matrix however, let's leave it at that.",6
2866,"I actually don't understand the storyline's of all four of these movies, I only go for the amazing special effects, and I gotta say they have blown me away with the fourth instalment.",8
2867,"Definitely worth the watch, see it and decide for yourself! You can't please everyone, go see it and make up your own mind.I really enjoyed the ideas of all the matrix movies. For this one I can understand the mixed feelings on this, the filming cinematography, to the newer actors etc. Nothing will ever compare to the trilogy series and events, especially for a new movie the build up the climatic events of a characters development. The way I see it the internet was still fairly new in the modern household when the Matrix was released in 99' so looking back it was really ahead of its time and added to the ""wow"" factor. Many have seen it since that time and our world has changed along with technology as well so of course it won't be as ""wow"" as the original. No different than when the first smart phone was released and everyone was ""wow"" impressed and now it's just ""meh"" same thing different packaging* (which was also talked about in movie). So that's my take on many of the low star reviews. I do understand them, and feel similar towards some things in the reviews, but it doesn't take away from the story. I feel if those minor things distract you from this movie why go see it in the first place? Overall I know this is an addition to the story and it was great in my mind, I am definitely glad this was made for the pondering minds out there. I will definitely watch it again in theaters and buy on release.",8
2868,"Hi from FINLAND and I did get the Brandon in there and even I know what it means. Whoopsie, it's not a secret. That could not have been a mistake. Lost all respect for this franchise for this BS.",6
2869,Solid story telling and decent action sequence sadly the action sequences in the original trilogy was better. Giving it a 8 to offset the negative marking of this movie.,8
2870,"This is getting more hate than it deserves. Did we need more Matrix movies? No. But yet the one we got managed to recapture some of that magic from before. The Matrix was a blockbuster action movie with deeper ideas that made you question your reality. The same can be said for this movie. Ironically, I think a reason this movie is not being received as well is an idea core to it, we don't want to wake up from the lies. We know the world around us is bad and getting worse every day but we don't want to confront it. We are afraid of radical change so we tell ourselves we can't do anything. If anything I think this movie leaned a little too heavily into the philosophy and didn't have enough mindless action to placate the masses.",7
2871,Ok um what?! I think this movie shouldn't have not been made. There was way too many parts they were doing like the old movies. I thought this was going to be something new but it's just the first three made into the forth.,6
2872,Hope they don't make any more of these!Its embarrassing what the makers think is a good movie.Not a movie you could recommend anyone to watch!Now this review won't even let me finish my review early!,3
2873,"Taking out everything that made the first film so good and then making jokes about it for the first half of the film is no way to bring it back. I watched through just to see what would happen and was not rewarded at all for my time. The two stars here are for Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, without whom I would have walked out before it ended.",2
2874,"I watched few YouTube videos from the trilogy to catch up with this one and what I came across is that movie made in 1999 had better fight scenes and moves, acting and logic. Why every movie is so Americanized, with this simple and childish humour, face expression and etc.I lowered my expectations with this movie so much, that when I left the cinema, I was not so disappointed like I should be.If you don't expect too much from this movie you will not be disappointed.",5
2875,"This may have been the final straw in my complete loss confidence in IMDB. I watched two movies today 1) Bad Trip and The Matrix Resurrections. After much anticipation, I had delayed seeing The Matrix Resurrections due to the dismal IMDB reviews but being a huge fan of the original decided to give it a try. I actually thought it was pretty good and was not disappointed but was very much so in IMDB. This morning, I also watched Bad Trip being a pretty big fan of Jackass and ""one of the guys"" was involved in the making. My assessment is that Matrix deserves almost two point and the other could lose a few.",8
2876,"Another proof of the fact that nothing can save you from the bad writing.I guess you will like the effects that have been used, but that's probably all you will like.",4
2877,"First off, no spoilers here... but thats because I'm not even sure there is anything to spoil. The first 90 minutes is basically a parody of the first movie, I guess its supposed to be like a nostalgic rollercoster ride of the first movie but it comes off feeling just like a cheap parody. At about the 95 min mark the main villain is revealed and explains the plot during a monologue. Cant make this up. Then for another hour the movie goes back and copies different scenes and themes from the original. There were probably about 2-3 original ideas in this movie that I thought were interesting but none of them had any real significance. There were times when the movie was laughably bad and multiple times I just groaned. I recommend skipping out on the theatre experience and watch it at home with friends so you can pause the movie and enjoy a non-intended laugh or two. Any review above 5-6 absolutely has to be fake. There is just no way somebody could give this an 8 or a 10.",3
2878,"So, let's make this simple. This is the fourth installment in The Matrix franchise, it revisits The Matrix world with wit, a timely perspective, and heart. In summary: The Matrix is still the Matrix, this is an adventure of Neo and Trinity in the Matrix. But you already knew this right, because you've seen the trailers and you know this is called ""Matrix Resurrections"". So if you would like to enjoy this new adventure welcome, but please don't watch it pretending you don't know this only to come back here to complain.",10
2879,Welp. I wanted to like it. I really did. I did like parts of it. But it was too much for it's own good. I do admire the ambition tho. Love the Neo and Trinity scenes but Wowwwwww did it take sooooooo long to get there!,6
2880,"I went in with a super open mind because I love the matrix but also because I did not want to believe all the bad reviews.I can see how some people might be turned off the first third, it's easy to get confused with the twists and turns, flash backs and symbolism stuff. BUT after the 1/3 half things really return back to the way the old matrix movies are.Seeing so many familiar faces from the old movies, or introducing new ones part of family lines that was so cool and I really liked it. It wasn't the greatest movie of all time but I definitely enjoyed watching it until the end.",8
2881,"This movie was terrible.The feel that it had from beginning to end was that of a cheap TV show adaptation (think Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman or Batwoman), rather than anything that comes close to approaching the epic that was The Matrix. Honestly, the whole thing makes you feel like you're watching a sequel to Tim Allen's 1999 movie Galaxy Quest more than anything titled The Matrix.Rather than put any work into the writing that would show us new and creative interpretations of the original that add depth while simultaneously paying homage, we are instead beat over the head with actual clips from the originals that all feel completely inorganic to the film we are being subjected to. Instead of using subtlety to naturally cultivate a sense of nostalgia, the film makes direct references to the original Matrix trilogy, even calling out ""The Matrix"" title multiple times, in ways that feel blunt and completely unnatural. (In fact, the juxtaposition between how great the original movie was compared to how horrible this one was, is only accentuated by this process.)The movie adds new characters that we don't care for in the slightest, slaps new faces onto old characters that do nothing but make us miss their originals, and brings back old characters in ways that make us wish they either died or stayed dead. None of this even begins to describe how juvenile they've turned all of the machines.The writers continually abuse their audience with painfully uninteresting dialogue and a clunky story that attempts to condense the first three movies and retell them all in one very bad movie instead. Why do this? I have no idea. ""And yet, here we are."" The fight scenes seem like they were choreographed by either Logan Paul or his brother; and every scene with a gun or gunplay was clearly written by someone who has never touched a real one.In the end, what made the original matrix so great was that it felt like it was showing us an untold story. As if it was really trying to reveal to us some great secret. And for those of us who had possibly already heard the story, it was showing it to us in a way that hadn't been seen before. It was a story about nothing in the world being what it seems - that this world is not what meets the eye. It spoke to us and resonated with us on deeper levels. But this movie lacked all of that. It was devoid of a single interesting idea. Like most Hollywood productions these days, it was a shameless cash grab.Do yourself a favor and show yourself some respect by not watching this movie. Instead, take all the money you would spend, buy your favorite snacks, make yourself as comfortable as possible in front of your favorite TV at home, or at a friend's house, and rewatch all the originals before ever wasting your time with this uninspiring production.",1
2882,"If the main task were offending all fans of the Matrix trilogy, the creators of Resurrection coped perfectly.The main complaints are all about the complete lack of logic inside the script.After half an hour of viewing, there is a feeling that the script was written by a group of mentally ill children unfamiliar with the laws of Logic and the very concept of ""cause-and-effect relationships"". This group of screenwriters was specially separated in such a way that one ""screenwriter"" did not know about the existence of a part of the script from another.The motivation of the main negative characters is none. All villains are uninteresting and illogical in their actions.Neo is no longer the chosen one. His role is leveled to zero.Staging fights at the level of a third-rate budget action movie.Visual effects were taken from twenty years ago movies.If there was an opportunity to put 0 points I would not hesitate to put them.",1
2883,"First of all, why were there so many blurry slow motion 90s action shots? Why does this movie have the CG of something made in 2004? How did the choreography and cinematography get worse after 20 years? I fell asleep twice and I was watching this movie at 7:00 p.m. I'm so glad I didn't pay money to see this in theaters because I would have walked out and asked for a refund and asked for a refund. I'm so glad I didn't pirate this movie because I would have been extra bummed about the extra time I wasted downloading it. I'm currently writing this review while the movies playing and I'm missing a bunch of stuff and I don't even think it matters. Horrible.",2
2884,"I could go on and on about all the plot holes and issues I have with the terrible writing, boring scenes and characters and sooo many things that simply don't make sense, but to sum it up, this movie is a mess that just doesn't work.I never want to rewatch this one, I feel like once was enough. Glad I streamed and didn't waste my money in the cinema.It makes the 2nd and 3rd movies which had a lot of issues look like really good movies.Skip this one.It's not a 1/10 but neither is it a 10/10 like some rate it here. It is a below average, 3/10 movie, only barely kept up by the return of some old characters and good CGI.",3
2885,"Sure, we were likely all seasoned Matrix fans catching the first local IMAX release at noon, but we all chuckled, then laughed at how our favourites on the screen warmed our hearts, then became stunned by the unimaginable effects as Mr. Anderson and Trinity save the day, yet again.I've watched various Matrix movies at least thirty or forty times, but this one, this one put them all together, moving beyond metaphor, taking everyone in the audience to the land of the red pill, the real reality we all share on this planet.Yes, far more than a shoot-em-up or kung fu flick - this was for the head, and the heart, and the soul. Thank you - somehow I held back the tears of happiness at seeing such a perfect Matrix - start to finish, fascinated - trying not to lose it in public. Thank you all for making this perfect movie; it's a timely profound piece of history.",10
2886,"I haven't reviewed any movie yet. But I had to do this for old movie's sake. This movie is nothing but a bad Matrix 1 imitation. Nothing new is happening at least do one thing original compare to Matrix's. Where is the improvement for 22 years, what a waste of money and time.The story was awful. So damn bad even I can not describe it. So many things are happening without a back story and foundationless.Music is so mediocre which you can hear any average movie nowadays. Also, fighting scenes and effects are too.To sum up, I guess we needed two Wachowski for one good Matrix movie. But this movie was the last nail in the Matrix's coffin.",1
2887,"The start of this film has you guessing as to where things are going, where things are based and how they connect.Slowly it becomes clear and old friends returning are explained.The same love story exist, neo and trinity. Only this time WHO has the power is almost swapped, this may have to do with the directors own transition, from the first film being male to now this one being female, giving our female leads more and more power and influence.The ending felt much like the end of reloaded, clearly open to continue if and when they wanted.Lots of call backs to the original, the score wasn't nearly as good missing that tech vibe the first two had so brilliantly.If a 5th was to occur I think the sisters need to reunite and direct together again. This one to me lacked the influence of both sisters directing, together they created the matrix and together they should finish these films with an ending fans and rally behind.",7
2888,"My title says it enough. Neo and Trinity were in it too deep and need rehabs!The 4th movie is a disgrace and it doesn't add any point or value to the trilogy. They'd better come up with a new story, new characters, the next Neo perhaps? And what's unbelievable is it's 2021 and the CGI is on par with the first 1999 Matrix...",3
2889,So disappointed. I was super bored and sleepy the whole time..... blah blah blah... my excitement turned into nightmare. What a waste of my time..................................................................................................................................................................,3
2890,"The first Matrix movie was revolutionary, a solid plot line that didn't melt your brain trying to understand it. Visually it was stunning and rightly so was highly regarded amongst action movies of its era. Reloaded was bearable to watch but again seemed to be over complicating what really should have only been a solo movie. The third instalment was poor, the Wachowski Brothers trying too hard to differentiate from the original film and making it even more tedious to watch. Reluctantly I decided to watch the fourth one, a glimmer of hope with Keanu and Carrie returning to their roles, but no Fishbourne in the trailers told me all I needed to know, and was cemented when I watched the film, which is the worst of the franchise. The directors clearly are trying to milk anything they can from this series, and now saying that it's to do with transgender people and their lives?? Sorry, being ""woke"" doesn't justify how garbage this really is. The cinematics are great but that doesn't make up for the drowsy conversations and constant flashbacks to the previous movies. Only Tarantino could've made something like this remotely bearable to watch. The final heist for the Wachowski brothers and a sad end to a series of declining movies that are fuelled by financial gain rather than a love for storytelling.",2
2891,"Wee bit of nostalgia however if they didnt make this we wouldnt be any the worse off.Some neat little call backs and the main cast did good with what meat they had but it definetly felt like a shakey attempt at a reboot of sorts.Perhaps letting sleeping bots lie mighta been the better option. Will say it was better than revolutions. Hoping there wont be anymore - i saw the original when it came out and it blew my mind , this one blew the cobwebs away but little else.",6
2892,"The movie was a total disgrace! I'm still trying to find how they managed to do a sequel so bad! Within 30m, I was about to live the cinema, although I was obligated to stay. It was a total disrespect to the fans. What a dreadful acting by Keanu Reeves. No emotions, just the same pathetic and tired face. I won't even talk about this Morpheus. I was already disappointed with the absence of Lawrence Fishburne, but this new Morpheus was worst than I thought! The movie was so bad, that I felt like it had 5 hours, because time didn't pass.",1
2893,"The first matrix was the best movie of the decades for me. I also loved 2nd and 3rd, despite a lot of people being critical about them.But Ressurections... they shouldn't've made it. I loved the idea to see Neo and Trinity once more, and hoped it will be something decent. But no. The weak script is one problem. The basic idea about Neo being kept in the matrix, and working as a game designer - was great, but they just could not develop it properly. It becomes more and more mudded and the usual fight sequences just don't save it.The second problem is actors. The new ones just don't play right. It all feels like Marvel universe comics. Does not feel serious at all. The artificial ppl is meh. Made out of m&amp;ms. Seriously?Which brings us the the third problem - the director. The first matrixes were serious, deep and philosophical. This one is just feels like comics. Not deep, not serious, just comics going through boring pages to the happy end.It could've been great. But they completely failed.",5
2894,"I just loved it. I felt myself getting emotional whenever Trinity and Neo were together, and the filmmakers did capitalize on those moments, but they made it work so that it felt natural.It is interesting to see if they eventually make another one because there is definitely potential there. Do I feel like they HAD to make this film? No, absolutely not. Am I surprised that it works? Yes, very much so.I do, however, wish Trinity got more screentime, that is my only complaint. Everything else, I loved.",8
2895,"I'm not sure how is this possible. It's a pretty solid film. It's not perfect, not as revolutionary as the first Matrix, but it's definitely a great and well though through production that deserves attention from the fans of the trilogy.With this being said, I'm surprised to see that much negativity, and so many people suggesting NOT to go and see the film. This really seems like a deliberate action against the Matrix. Who's behind it? Is there another film that needs attention and fights for it by brining down Matrix? I don't know. But I seriously doubt that all these reviews are people giving their honest opinion.My suggestion: go and watch it. To me, the characters were not as likable as in the old days, but nevertheless I enjoyed the flow and the entertainment value. Plus, seeing those mature actors reunite after so many years (I was 15, when the first Matrix came out) is a very special and nostalgic moment.So, after reading the reviews here, I actually thought this would be a waste of time. But I'm glad I was wrong. It's been a great movie to watch. And I hope to see another sequel from Wachowski.P. S. I've been watching it in 4K and this imagery is so realistic that I wish they somehow made it more cinematic, because you often feel like you're on a movie set. Just a bit too realistic to my taste. Two things should never be done to a movie: frame rate above 24-25 fps, and that digital quality that is so crispy it feels like you're there standing behind the camera.",8
2896,"A worse version of Matrix 1. Not bad, but not good. Everything from the first movie done a little bit worse...Forgettable. And that is the worst thing a movie like the Matrix can be.",5
2897,"The grit, darkness, and energy are missing. TMR is quite literally a shell of its former self. The film leans heavily on cut scenes from the previous movies to stay interesting. In addition, the recasting of some characters is just terrible (Jonathan Geoff???). Despite this, I did enjoy the direction of the story.It's like a good carbonated beverage but flat.",4
2898,"Maybe its the product of time, but this movie felt like what would happen if some outsiders tried to make a Matrix movie as a B-movie. It wasnt bad. But not incredible either. The underlying hidden protagonist is time, which is kind of depressing and contains a plot hole where the Matrix world has changed as a result of time progression in the real world, which doesnt align with the concept that the matrix exists as a snapshot of society around the time it was originally filmed, explained away as this Matrix is a reboot version thanks to NEO (thanks neo). The fact the dialogue or story are still not up to par of the original story line and this one borrows so heavily as a reboot for content, just adds fuel to the fire of the conspiracy theory that the original story line was stolen from someone and the directors had to do humiliation rituals.",5
2899,"How did this movie even happen? The first Matrix was great - They should have stopped there. Second one was disappointing. Third one was ridiculously bad. And now, after 16 years to ponder, they drop this obscenely unnecessary convoluted craziness on the world? I literally just felt bad for everyone involved. I can't even make fun of it because it was such a sad offering. The Wachowski that sat this one out is the real genius here.",3
2900,"I watched the movie an it's not so bad what people are making out, the people that are giving it a low rating probably have one brain cell an don't understand the idea of the matrix movies, if such simpletons can't understand it, then don't watch it,go back to watching in the night garden..",8
2901,I am not sure where the hate is coming from. I am a fan of the matrix trilogy and I find this one entertaining. I remember when the first one came out and everyone has these hates also but only appreciated the trilogy when it becomes a classic. I think some fans are expecting the writers to tackle about the machines. But i am pretty sure this is not written as a one shot film only.,10
2902,"I had a lots of expectation from this movie, unfortunately i was disappointed thoroughly. Can you believe in the movie there is some talk between Neo and Agent Smith about Warner Brother making another sequel to the trilogy? Looks like they were mocking Matrix in Matrix. Truly disappointed.",5
2903,"I cannot believe that Hugo Weaving or Laurence Fishburne were not in this movie. What a giant fail... ethos movie is a giant fail 2 minutes in, with the Bug character being unintelligible and 2 of the most critical characters in the original weren't even in this crummy remake. So lame......The trivia says that Weaving could not be in it due to scheduling conflicts with other movies.... WELL THEN, YOU RESCHEDULE the filming of the stupid movie...This is a fail, right out of the gate - 5 minutes in.... Boring....",1
2904,Cash grabbing and just a shame of a movie. I will just assume the previous film was the last. The action scenes were grabbed from your nearest street fighter game and the script has been written by your ten-year-old niece who just finished reading Twilight.,1
2905,"Tbh it started well and hooked me in. Reminded me of the ,originals which I saw at the cinema.I did enjoy it 90% through.But neo was always the one, the daughter got involved and decided to make Neo not the one.Let's make wonderman and see how that goes down.Total disrespect to the original imo.",3
2906,"So many strange decisions in this film. The Meta references..., the focus on Neo and Trinitys relationship. The need to bring back every nostalgic character often for no purpose...This movie at its best is when it's doing new things and NOT rehashing the old films. I wish it was a completely new story with Neil Patrick Haris and John Groff because they are amazing actors. Keanu had a bad script to work with but still did great as neo.",5
2907,"To start with ive still no idea what the hell is going on, but neo and trinity are back, for all I care they could make a movie knitting jumpers.""I still know kung fu"" yeah baby 😀😀😀",10
2908,"Honestly, in all seriousness, this is the worst movie i can remember in a long long time because of the existing cast and crew and budget. There is no scenematic feeling or special effects in the movie apart from some reflective puddles at the beginning and then a series of kinda funny but kinda serious connections to whats going on in our society today then.......mind numbing action scenes mixed with poorly scripted character building moments gives you a rather upset feeling when the credits roll at the end.I usually stay to the end end incase of a egg or trailer etc for any movie i have interest in seeing at all, I waited till the end of Beowulf incase there was anything as that sparked a 5% interest level, i walked out as soon as that first Matrix credit name appeared so I could forget the abuse Keanu and co endured.No offense to the actors as they did their best having to work being filmed in showbox locations with poor camera angles and depth along with poor sets and a script that should have never seen the light of day or wasting printer ink and paper or anyones times that sees this clipshowesque montage flashbacky crap rushed movie experience.Dougie Howsers/Barney's best movie roles still being Starship Troopers and Harold and Kumar go to white castle.",3
2909,"Camerawork, cinematography and the whole fight / action choreography was absolutely awful compared to the 21 year old original movie ....The soundtrack was pretty much non existent except for the intro sequence ?Back then the dialogues had a certain depth, with philosophical and maybe religious aspects, the dialogues in this movie were written by a teenager ?Some of the CGI was good, some of it was absolutely terrible - Theres a short sequence where you see the house from the analyst, ALL the buildings are fake and look really cheap, like from a 10 year old video game ... they use CGI nowadays for things where there is no real need, i guess it saves time and cost compared to searching for real filming locations, i get it - But its absolutely horrible for the imersion.Same with the fight sequence with Neo and Morpheus, i dare to say it was a real movie set back then, now everything was CGI, you just dont believe it, the imersion gets destroyed this way.",3
2910,"Very sad to see movies made just for the sake of making a buck, this is a disgrace to the original movie. Poor cinematography, poor visual effects, even the acting has got diluted, chemistry is off and all in all a empty story, i would say the concept is good but the execution is a big let down, i love Keanu &amp; Moss but this was a b grade movie running on the original matrix juice.",4
2911,"Execpt this time is with the same actors, another try at milking a franchise that shows if you use the right title it will give lots of money no matter how pointless or lame it is. If you don't get the point of the franchise simply throw a lot of throwback scenes and fill with empty pointless dialog an voilà, is oh so deep and you have an instant factory-made hit which is the envy of the market research department.Too bad it resurrected as a zombie.",4
2912,"This is undoubtedly my favourite Matrix. Fresh, up to date, funny, winking at us as views, really really enjoyed it!!! Well done to the makers for taking the risk and creating it!!!",10
2913,"I created an account on IMDB JUST to review this title,Do i recommend this movie. No.The first 30 minutes are just pure cringe, i get the understanding of ""trying to lure new audiences"" in with the gaming, but it seems to cheapen the experience and there are better ways of doing this without cheapening the experienceTo me, the fact that they can just suddenly get in and out of the matrix without an phone tap now just feels like lazy writing EVEN IF time has passed and the ""technology has gotten better""what parts of the story are given are boring to say the least and get glossed over so quickly it's not worth listening to.MAJOR DOWNSIDE - no Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus OR Hugo Weaving as Smith.Pretty much the movie is just a clipshow and a B Grade parody of it's source material running on the coat-tails of the previous 3 and while the 3rd did poorly, i'd still recommend watching it over this one.Honestly wouldn't be surprised if this was just squirted out just to keep ""The Matrix"" licensing under the Studio's umbrella.",1
2914,"I can certainly see why, for people who were expecting something more convectional and safe, this will be a dud.But if you're more open minded, and willing to go where this story takes you, it's extremely interesting. It's very self-referential, taking a look at the matrix phenomenon itself, and it's impact on people, and the pressure to make more, and what that feels like for the filmmakers.And I think also does a good job expanding the lore and mythology of the matrix story. In a way that feels organic to the internal story and unfolding of events after the matrix revolutions.",9
2915,Confusing start...You'll want to leave by minute 7.It picks up a bit when Neo shows up. Still... kinda weird and non MatrixLots of annoying flashbacks. And regurgitated quotes from the past movies.,2
2916,"There are two reasons why I gave a specific assessment.The first is that I want to dissuade other people from watching this film by focusing exclusively on the trilogy.The second is that money, publicity and lack of imagination do not deserve the space to destroy the reputation that the Matrix trilogy has.Connecting the whole concept of the Matrix with games and the modern trend of gaming is insane and totally irrelevant to the seriousness and complexity of the theme of the trilogy.I am extremely disappointed and although I deeply believed in myself that there was a potential for the trilogy to continue, now I regret it and I wish I hadn't even looked at this but that the story ended where it should have.The choice of key characters completely ruined the depth that the trilogy has, the futuristic feeling of oppression of the human mind and the constant struggle for freedom of will.Everything is written exclusively of a subjective nature, and judging by the comments of other members, all serious and loyal fans have acquired the same feeling of ruin, uselessness, redundancy and deep, inner sorrow with which all previous glory was destroyed.If you are a true fan of this series, take a look at how to see all the flaws and direct your strength of mind to the original point, purpose and goal.Know thyself!",4
2917,"Why, oh why didn't you pick the blue pill... (and skipped on this one altogether)?! Small hope at the beginning dissipated quickly and mercilessly.Seriously - no one is going to give you back the 155 minutes you will loose with this excuse for a sequel.Not a single good idea - all reused/refurbished from the original trilogy.. with added BS or simply dull. Well, (spoiler) they HAD to make Trinity fly too... that is so important, that they forgot to add any other value to the package... Really wtf...I know too big expectations can ruin the experience of watching a new movie, but in this case expectations had nothing to do with the fail..",2
2918,"We had high expectations for this movie, we were actually really excited to watch. It was really confusing at first but halfway through the movie, we start to understand what's going on but, there again, we get confused once again.It was just okay... It has its good moments but the 3 past movies are better. I think it could have been better.",5
2919,"First of all I must say that I liked it. I don't think it needed to be made but once it was announced I was buzzing. I love the matrix universe, the style, the fight scenes and the bending of reality is very cool. The plot of this though just wasn't strong enough to carry the story. Jonathan Groff was great as the villain I thought but NPH could have played his role more seriously rather than almost comedic, I know that they were trying to go for a guy that was so powerful he thought it was funny that he could even be challenged but it didn't work that well.",8
2920,"This sequel is far away from being the masterpiece matrix once was. However, it's a pretty good sequel and a nostalgic revisit to a beloved universe. It's much better than I expected, also with a touch of self irony.More than anything- this movie makes me wonder why Hollywood is not able to make any good original movies anymore. The last innovative good action movie was The Matrix 1. A revisit is welcome, but where are the new talents with new ideas?",8
2921,"Quase recebe o SELO: Indiana Jones e o Reino da Caveira de CristalRoteiro fraco, totalmente cheio de desconexões, tenta ""gourmetizar"" as realidades tentando expor múltiplas realidades do passado (1,2 e 3) e do futuro (provável 5 e 6).Um completo fracasso para um fã incondicional da trilogia como eu.Desculpem a sinceridade e decepção.",2
2922,"Those who give negative marks to the film make me believe that they did not understand the film.If you want 100% action, you can watch Avengers ...Personally, I liked the movie, a mature and captivating story.",10
2923,"Just for the record, I'm not against empowering women... just don't do it in a good story like this one.Neo is the choosen, he was the ""calculated error"" from the matrix, him!All the others characters help him to became the choosen and Trinity was one of them and now he could even fly and she does?She was never had small role, she was already a badass character, he saved her and she saved him, sticked to him untill the end.We need NEW good stories and movies (we already have but we need more) with great female main caracthers and not a ""neo"" woman character.Please... just stop.I won't even talk about the bad action scenes like 2m distance shooting and no one was hit???Or the weak plot, forgetable characters... and... and.. ugh.This whole pile of garbage could be replaced by a seventh chosen or tell a history about the other five, nobody mention if they were men.A new history based on this universe but no... ok... let me stop here.",1
2924,"The film was mediocre at best. The CGI and cinematography were great but it didn't feel like a Matrix film. Morpheus Joking about his sunglasses gave me flashbacks to when they ruined the Terminator franchise by making Arnie wear Elton John sunglasses. It's as if they felt it wouldn't be accepted as a Matrix film if they didn't reuse all of the famous quotes/recreate iconic scenes but tried to do it in a lighthearted way so nobody would think they were pretentious. However, this ended up making the film feel like a bad joke.Instead of reusing/remaking all the old quotes/scenes, they should have been striving to think of new ones.Additionally, I found myself cringing at the new Agent Smith and Morpheus because it felt like they were just a couple of normal guys doing bad impressions. The Merovingian felt like he was over-acted as well.The film really could have been amazing and the fundamental story would have been a great addition to the trilogy if they had managed not to fall short in so many ways. Overall, I'm disappointed and it's definitely not what I was expecting. I should have known better though, reboots and sequels that come out decades after the story has concluded are almost always bad cash grabs.",5
2925,Was so excited to watch this movie and it was a complete disaster!!!! It was even worse than the 2nd wonder woman movie. A complete disaster. Beyond disappointment 😞,1
2926,"This movie is really bad &amp; never sets a tone. I wouldn't spend another dime on the matrix after this. 25% of the movie is from a board meeting at Warner Brothers, 75% of this movie is nostalgia &amp; bad dialogue.",2
2927,"Contrary to most, I will be rather positive. I wouldn't say it's the worst movie, let alone this year, but totally meh and pointless. I liked a lot of things and saw the potential in them and how they could justify the existence of this sequel, but while watching I wondered why it existed, what it meant, and generally felt out of place.The whole time I had the feeling this is a movie made by someone who is a fan of the Matrix, not from one of the core creators. With the exception of a few scenes, the action was horrible, as was the over-reliance on nostalgia and fan service. Even meta-jokes at times crossed the line of good taste and were too much. On the other hand, I justify them in a perverse way, because I see that this is the only way to be relevant with this sequel - to make fun of yourself. It is obvious from afar that it is a desperate attempt at a cash grab and the fruit of the crisis of the personality of Sister Washovska. But Warner will lose big time, thanks to being too close to Spider-Man, and going out on HBO Max at the same time, and it's going to flop hard, and we won't see or hear anything about The Matrix again for at least the next five years.But, in the end, I love Neo and Trinity too much as characters, Carrie Ann Moss and Keanu are super sweet to me and there is chemistry between them, which makes me a little biased. What's more, going back to this brutal, raw and cyber-punk world (even tho a little sugar coated here), made my heart pound again. But no matter how much I force myself, I can't give him more than 6/10.",6
2928,"This movie was not necessary and they should have left well enough alone. The Matrix was ground breaking and revolutionary and its two sequels completed the original story. The end. It was complete, leave it alone. It should have been left alone. This movie, resurrections, is not a bad movie in itself. In fact up until Neo realizes he is truly in another Matrix and not crazy it was actually quite entertaining, the viewer actually felt like Neo confused, unsure, but beyond that it appears to become yet another woke attempt by Hollywood to rewrite the original or better yet morph it into another woke message. The remaining general is a women, the lead ships captain, a woman, the architect of the plan to free Trinity, a woman, and Trinity, ah Trinity, she saves the day and without her Neo is nothing, She appears to be ""the one"" now. The evil villains of course are all men. I have nothing against female leads, but this is a bit too obvious. Alas this strategy of remaking our world by engulfing us in a new woke reality has become a tired Hollywood narrative that has ruined every franchise it touches, ala ghost buster and terminator. Interestingly enough the routine swipes at conservatives promulgated by Hollywood has recently morphed into attacks on the elites instead and here we see it appear. However the woke message of remaking the world, into more of a rainbow, is actually spoken out loud and obvious. Beyond that, this movie offers no ground breaking realizations as did the first Movie, no ground breaking special effects. No ground breaking message either. Ultimately this movie is just a way to make some dough off of the original movies. Why no Morpheous? The lack of many of the original actors is also a detraction in my opinion. Unfortunately while the movie on its own is not really badly done, in the shadow of the original and with all the injected wokeness, it was just better left undone.",5
2929,"The best metaphor to describe this film is like an old fat bald smelly man that keeps on pulling out photographs of himself when he was good looking and in his youth to try and convince you to sleep with him. If Warner brothers would have given me the money I could have made a better film . . . And considering that I've never written or directed a film, I should not feel that way but I did given how horrible this movie was.",1
2930,"I just spent the last two and a half hours moving between confusion, laughing at the ridiculous aspects of this film and struggling to continue watching because I thought maybe, just maybe they would redeem themselves.That did not happen. This movie was horrible. Such a disappointment. It's like the writers wanted so badly to explain why they were making a fourth movie that the entire film turned into an explanation.Just save your time- it's not worth it.",3
2931,"I'm a very serious Matrix fan. I've watched them all over and over. Matrix 1, 2 and 3 are always at the top of my movie lists. Besides that magical trilogy, this 4th movie was very bad. Okay, not a bad movie for today. It may well be counted. But compared to the Matrix trio, it remains a very low-level movie. I wish you had never made this movie. Some things are beautiful in their own time. Just as Macbeth was written, so should the Matrix remain. It will be better if you remove the name Matrix from this movie.",3
2932,"It seems the best way to sequel the Matrix 20 years later is the way of - parody.Unfortunately, for today standards, this movie is bland. But then again for a risk like this in 2021, that's an overwhelming success, I guess?!While the movie itself is fine, it lacks that sinister tone and villains that are menacing. Action is plain ok, nothing mindblowing. Which we kinda expected tho and it just isn't there.I think, the best way for this movie to go was full on absurdity, but as it is now - charming and too meta for it's own good.However, the main point I wanna bring up is - I didn't feel insulted, didn't feel like the movie was wasting my time or making me feel bad that I like the old movies. And in today's reboot/sequel/softwhatever climate, you gotta appreciate that.All actors are fine and all that jazz. Music is fine, however end credits cover song made me feel sick, it's just gross.It's not the best Matrix sequel we could get but it's way better than it has any right to be by just existing for the sole purpose of existing. Sure, you should watch it but keep your expectations in place and a bit of an open mind.",6
2933,"This fourth installment was better than part 2 &amp; 3 imo. I'd rank it along the top with the first film! They used what worked in the first film &amp; just implemented those factors into this film. For those people who are giving this film a lousy rating they just can't understand the film. It went way over their incompetent pee sized brains. There's a lot going on this movie. You have to have some level of intelligence &amp; not ADD to follow along I think that it was absolutely BRILLIANT how they explained Neos &amp; Trinity's death in part 3. I throughly enjoyed how both main characters were reinsert back into the ""Matrix"" but this time they possessed the same thoughts &amp; memories BUT different bodies &amp; appearances. So again there's alot going on &amp; you have to pay attention to the details to understand the plot &amp; follow the ""white rabbit""",10
2934,"If you're here to see what other people think about it because you're not sure how to feel about it, you should rewatch it. If you're here to see if it's worth watching, did you really even have a choice? Watch it. I feel like a lot of people are forgetting what the point of this all is. You're meant to enjoy the movie. It might not be exactly the same as the first movie and it might not share the same mood as the trilogy, but isn't that the point? They're not trying to do the same old remake. They're trying to free your mind.",10
2935,"No idea what I've just watched. Felt like the director was kidnapped by evil studio CEO and forced at gunpoint to make this movie and in order to get rescued, director put in hints so that people watching would clearly know that she's held against her will and try to find and rescue her.I really hope someone called 911 and that Lana is being rescued as we speak.As a matter of fact, I hope that also all the actors, fight coreographers and vfx artist did this move at gunpoint. I refuse to believe that any of the scenes were done under their free will.And to think that I've re-watched the first 3 movies last week. Those who've seen this one, know that the joke is on me.Only redeeming thing in the movie is a slow motion shot of a bullet going through an apple. One extra star for that.",2
2936,"Why would anyone do this? Why would one take something so good and original as the first Matrix and ruin it, cheapen it like this?Everything was just bad in this movie: writing, action, effects, the battle scenes which used to be famous for their choreography...it all felt like a B-movie parody. Half of it wasn't even new, they used clips from the trilogy to fill the gaps...It just left me with a bitter taste in my mouth that cannot be washed even if I watched the first Matrix movie all over...because now I know that the Matrix 4 exists and I just wish I didn't.",3
2937,Getting dumped by yours truly is a blessing compared to watching this movie. After watching the trilogy and being one of my favorites this thing almost ruined it all.,1
2938,"It was very sad that the story of matrix landed some kind of joke and you never feel connected to the story or characters that was you fell for ""neo"" in the previous version of matrix. Such a disappointment to a fine triology.",5

2940,If you are a true Matrix fan you will love this movie. It is at least as good if not better than the original Matrix.Often when you have high expectations a movie is a disappointment and often when expectations are low the movie is a pleasant surprise. This was one of those rare movies where expectations were high and it was actually better than expected.I cannot understand the negative reviews. I can only conclude that they wanted non-stop fight action as dialogue is too complicated for them to grasp.The first hour was fantastic. It did get a little slow in the middle but soon built up to a grand finale.If you are a true Matrix fan wondering whether to watch then I say do not hesitate.,10
2941,"Nostalgia is strong here and found myself smiling at certain points where former characters were reintroduced. Worth a single watch for that alone. But that's about it.No existential esotericisms. No innovative action scenes. The plot was mediocre. The editing cuts and slow motion were somewhat janky during action scenes. The fight scenes were a crowded mess. The martial arts precision found in the earlier films was notably absent.The Animatrix demonstrated that the property is an interesting realm with the potential to explore different characters and stories.But instead, the WB chose to rehash the same main characters. This left no room for meaningful character development of the introductory cast.Consequently, little was done to expand the preexisting Matrix mythos.",5
2942,"*no spoiler*, very very good movie, every true fan needs to watch it more than once. There is too much to listen to, too much to see but overall best matrix movie ever! The 1999v was only the best until there was more to the universe lore! Still it was very good morally and it hits the zeitgeist 100%... To connect this movie in such a way to all the movies was mesmerizing and it worked out near perfect! All questions answerd! (except existential questions lmao) The problem that 3 generations of eyes can rate this movie is the biggest problem! Between those haters and lovers the critics will see the work and thought which went into this and it is for sure not only a quick cash grad! Go watch it! Download it! And watch it again!! Watch it many times!Matrix 4 is like a very good wine and if you hate it you either dont like wine or you are not mature enough for it.... Thanks a lot for this movie, thank you agent smith! You truly saved us all!",10
2943,Seemly overly complicated story to make this movie work. The new characters have not much for unique personality.Its like warmed up left overs with thrown in hot sauce too spice it up but it took and ruined the true essence of the dish.Definitely not as good as previous movies but entertaining none the less.Hoping this was retire meant the Matrix movies.,6
2944,"Wish I had never seen this. If haven't seen it yet, just don't. Try and keep the original trilogy in your memory. Absolutely unnecessary sequence to a great franchise. Thank you for nothing wachowski.",3
2945,The people that aren't given good ratings to this movie are people that obviously weren't fans in the first place. Of the matrix or any of the matrix films. I am a fan from when the first movie came out of the matrix all the way up till this one the resurrection which I thought was a good movie I hope there's more to come I enjoy watching The matrix and like the added features that they brought to the new film thank you.,10
2946,"The problem for this film isn't the film itself - which is adequate. The problem is what went before and the raised expectations.Don't go to Matrix; Resurrections expecting something like film 1 or 2. Those were brilliant genre changing icons. Resurrections is better than the disappointment and gobbledegook of film 3 - but that's not saying much.Resurrections is probably a low-budget attempt to test the water and see if the Matrix franchise still has it. On this showing - with this budget - with this kind of inward-looking story sadly it doesn't.This is the Neo/Trinity self-reverential show. It's too slow, has none of the grab or zip your looking for. Unfortunately it flirts with being not very good and a lower star rating.See it for completeness.",6
2947,"Bad writing, bad editing, chaotic storyline. There was nothing original in the new part. Some characters exist for no apparent reason. Inconsistent plot with many dead ends. Just a poorly made movie.",3
2948,Most disappointing movie of 2021. Pointless action regularly interrupted by over explaining interrupted by random attempts at self-satire interrupted by Neo being tired and confused. This movie is a soulless money-grabbing mess. Do yourself a favor and just rewatch the first movie.,5
2949,"So I wasn't expecting anything to even come close to the first Matrix but this was one of the most disappointing movies of all time. I literally fell asleep twice. It started out with potential but the story was convoluted and didn't really make much sense. The action was lacking, the acting was horrible, the casting was awful and it was simply boring for most of the movie. My son is 17 and he could barely make it through the entire movie. I just wanted it to end because I realized it was not going to get any better. I watched the first Matrix 4 times in the theater, it was brilliant from beginning to end. This movie was just sad and made me realize movies are just on a downward trend.",2
2950,"This movie was so disappointing. I wasn't expecting anything good from it. They are playing with the viewer and hit you on nostalgia. Trinity doesn't remember who she is and Neo tries to make her remember. They might have some good ideas for the new film but they didn't make it look good too. The cinematography sucks. There are no beautiful shots in the film. The actors are not even trying to play. No bullet shots, no slow motions. Nothing. You are being fooled. They even having fun at Morpheus expense. There is a scene (which is shown on a wall from a projector like a movie theatre) from the first film when Neo meets with Morpheus and the ""new"" Morpheus is making jokes and laughs at the old one. What was that? Are they serious? They are mocking their own films and characters. That was the worst. It made me feel so upset and empty. They use some old scenes which were so perfect in the first Matrix. They based their film on nostalgia, as I previously said. It's like some fans of the Matrix gathered in a circle and talked about some facts of the films and said their ideas they had about the Matrix. And the most important thing. Where was the green? There were only a few shots with green filter but we all remember that the Matrix was green. Well, if you expect to see the good, old, green Matrix you will be disappointed. If you liked the first film or even the first trilogy I wouldn't recommend you to watch The Matrix Resurrections. You better watch the first and have some really great time rewatching The Matrix.",1
2951,"Very good sequel to the original trilogy. The Matrix has always had a metaphorical message on modern society and doesn't fail here either. Instead of only agents being the guardians of the original Matrix ""swarming"" is now developed by this version of the Matrix where the citizens are recruited to protect the Matrix: ring camera and social media anyone? One example of many if you pay attention. A lot of people didn't understand the original Matrix and rode along for the action, so no surprises about the idiotic reviews, anyway there's plenty here don't worry. Very good movie and would rate it a 8 but added a point to counteract the ridiculous 1 star reviews. Free your mind with the red pill before watching and you'll enjoy it.",9
2952,"They had millions of dollars. They had original actors. They had 2021 year CGI technologies. What could went wrong?With all of these, they somehow created a perfect trash.",1
2953,"Another masterpiece from Lana, intelligent, beautiful, nice action, treats for sense8 fans and ofcourse Keanu and. Carrie-Anne were on top of their game like allways, also adition of NPH was exelent. Not just exelent entertanment but allso food for tought.",10
2954,"Not that great. Watch for the nostalgia. None of the sequels touch the first one. This one felt like it was missing something. I like the idea of it, but Lana Wachowski seems to insert pretentious, spiels. She did that several times here, and over and over in the Sense 8 series, it took away from it.I guess this was a movie of her friends, as a lot of the original cast and of Sense 8 were in the movie.It lacked the magic of the originals. The originals we were hooked on figuring out the ideas. This one didn't really have new ideas. They emphasized the pointlessness part of existing in the matrix. But also I was left with the feeling that Neo and Trinity coming back was also pointless in the real world. Like they are too old to have children, so they aren't birthing something. Are they just going to meddle and try to save people? Just fly around and do stuff? I suppose that reflects mid-age people at the moment... who aren't choosing children and there is a pointlessness about their lives. So people just get bitter and dabble in other peoples lives or unimportant things. Maybe then Trinity and Neo will start to get annoying, as they'll start inserting themselves into things people didn't ask for. Kind of like a generation that is annoying because it's purposeless.I think if more sequels come... yes, I will watch. But this is a disappointing start. Maybe play into the various phases of life. They are a bit older than mid-age, maybe their shift into elders and to death are next.",5
2955,"I was wary. How could anyone pick up this story and make a worthy fourth installment? They did. 20 min in, and I was utterly hooked. The meta-levels, the self-reflection and evolved philosophy blew my mind. But, yeah, you have to ""get it"", it's not served to you.",10
2956,"Fever Dream1. (figurative, descriptive) A disjointed or strange experience, especially one that engenders an even greater sense of outlandishness when considered retrospectively, similar to how actual fever dreams feel in real life.2.

2957,"UGH! So incredibly BAD. Goodbye, Wachowski(s)!! Waste of hundreds of watts of electricity and time and rental money. Should have been called, ""The Matrix Redone (Badly)"" because it seems as though they thought the first matrix wasn't good enough and needed improvement. It was great and it didn't need improvement and this certainly was far from that. And very weird concepts as well. Deliberately made to be confusing. A betrayal that should be ignored and forgotten as soon as possible. Really, really bad.",1
2958,"Well I've watched only the first twenty minutes. Movie was so bad that I had to stop watching and do something else. Did really wachowskis make the original trilogy? Let alone making this, the genius behind the original trilogy wouldn't even watch this.",3
2959,"I did watch The Matrix 20 years ago when I was 13.It gave me something I ve never thought I could have.Now year 2021 and this incredible cast has made this great movie.People who says its dissappointing are simply not qualified to review movies or comprehend above average level art.So do not care about these people at allactually do not care about what average people think what so ever and never.If you feel good about The Matrix this movie will be your part too ,You cant run away but love it and admire it.Keanu ,Carrie and and new actors are amazing ,editing is great ,cinematograhpy is legendary,sets and colour are incredible ,script is wonderful.Yes there arent huge sets or epic 10 min length action science and the reasons are simply; 1 - pandemic2- It has been 20 years people change.You will love Matrix Resurrections, admire it and simply feel lucky that you could watch the 4th movie after 20 years!",10
2960,Just felt like a really cheap budget movie. So many plot holes. Fight scenes were so weak. Looked like they were practice fighting. Story was just awful. Definitely gonna forget that this one was made. There will only be the trilogy. They made this solely for the money and not the story. To top it off they ended it with a terrible cover of the Rage Against the Machines song from the original.,1
2961,"It is a soulless and evil scam to squeeze out few bucks from fans. This movie does not take itself seriously and is a sad ending of a this series. It goes by a familiar template of recent reboots plus a good part of movie is just footage of previous movies. If you need an idea of what I'm talking about then remember star wars reboot, how Luke Skywalker was drinking milk from that alien.",4
2962,"I feel like this mess could happen if a millennial described the matrix to their parents and those in their turn described to it to their grandchildren. That and an old spotty vhs could be the inspiration.This really is a bad parody. Almost every detail is bad: nonsensical plot, unmemorable cast, outdated fighting, lazy vfx.I rate this quite high only because I'm always glad to see Reeves and Moss.Ps crazy quality soundtrack to the original was a huge part of the success. I don't remember a single track from this one, were there any songs at all?",6
2963,"Had some interesting concepts, however a bad supporting cast and a weak script break the movie. The director basically tells you why ""she"" was forced to make this movie lol. It doesn't feel like the matrix at all. None of the slow motion is warranted. The fight choreography is subpar compared to the originals. I get theyre old but with body doubles and cgi it wouldve looked a lot better. The new archi.. i mean analyst and the new agent smith just arent convincing. The soundtrack is atrocious as well. An the exiles? Oh my god what a complete joke man. Did they have to dress them as literal homeless people or did they run out of money? Smh.",5
2964,"I've read about much of the criticism regarding this film, And while I can honestly understand much of it, this film does not deserve the amount of backlash it's getting.However, as a huge fan of the original trilogy (yes, the sequels too), I lowered my expectations way below, and gave it a chance to try and prove those low expectations wrong. And while the film try to shake things up in changing some of the mythology of the series, that made the originals so great, and inventive, and much thankful to the amazing first film, this film is in a pretty impossible task to match that kind of level, and I can give credit of trying to adopt new layers of elements within the franchise. Does it all work? No. Does it all fail? Also no.Its harder to digest since the changes they made, and new characters and subplot, but in the end its very much of the same. Its if there are changes, but not actual ones. Just different names and ""skins"" to much of the same.But this was very much a Neo's film and journey of a self rediscovery.Yeah, it feels underwhelming to the original three, which were big bombastic scifi philosophical action films, that reinvented the genre, and questioned social constructs as we know it, and all had something new to add, a stylish action packed that had a great combo of entertainment and much thought behind them. But, I understood some of the direction they took. With much, Much, slower burn than the originals.It feels much less climatic, smaller scaled, but more personal, and self aware story, to a point of mocking itself, and its motives, at some points during the film.Yes, It should have been better, it should have had more soul, and love put into it, it should have respected more the lore of the originals, cinematography, score, atmosphere, feeling and characters, and should have been made in times Hollywood was here to tell stories, and not pander its audiences with identity politics and gaslight their ideologies in every film, (Merv was totally right with his criticism), but this film is not much in fault of being a product of it's time, and still In times that much of most major franchises are being compromised, and in trying to fix past ""mistakes"" (poor sequels/prequels/reboots/remakes/spinoffs).We are entering an era of fan service, after the recent years pushed much of its audience away, and while some did a great job in fixing it, and uniting old and new fans (Spider-Man No Way Home, Dune, The Suicide Squad, Snyder's JL and Ghostbusters: Afterlife), most still in the process of going back to their roots in focusing on telling a great compelling story. And there's still hope for many of those.Will time will help to the advantage of the film to be better and have a better outlook? We'll have to wait and find out. But take it for what it is. A film that should have been better, but ended up not being bad, with few good elements that might work for it on the long run.",7
2965,"What a disgrace. This movie was pure disappointment. I was so looking forward to watching the new Matrix. Minutes into it, it felt like a fan-made film about the Matrix trilogy. It didn't even feel like it was a Matrix film. The wardrobe sucked. So much color. It reminded me of Suicide Squad a little. I don't even feel like adding anymore to this review because it doesn't deserve my time. It was a wasteful watch.",1
2966,"Okay, perhaps my first review of this film cut a little too close to the bone in addressing the issues we face currently in Hollywood. So I will endeavor to not use trigger words such as 'the opposite to asleep' movements which seem to be defining all our viewing pleasures.Keanu Reeves even said after filming ""he was disappointed with his younger cast members lack of professionalism and willingness to rehearse"" - that's coming from arguably the nicest man in Hollywood - I guess that's what happens when you can't get legends such as Lawrence Fishburne, and attempt to replace him with a sub-par actor, and that's being generous. The agent smith replacement / actor (if you can call him that) couldn't hold a candle against Hugo Weaving.The whole experience was so disappointing. It struck me that the writers were really on to a good thing, and the mob got to them and forced them into creating some all accepting worthless drivel in the name of (you fill the gaps) - it's just such a shame that a really good trilogy had to end this way. It won't be the end - watch this space, many good trilogies will be ruined before I turn to dust.",2
2967,Even if the movie is a little bit to nostalgic I enjoyed every minute. Looking forward to next movie and I hope we will see real Morpheus at some point.,10
2968,"Honestly I quite enjoyed the first 60-70 min of the film! There was mystery, intrigue, a decent explanation for similarities (unlike Star Wars 7-9 where everything was linear and based in 1 reality), and perhaps new questions about reality and the matrix itself. What was Neo's role really? What are the machines up to now? And the humans? Why are things this way? It was setting up beautifully until......The plot is everyone is fine, but Neo wants to risk it all to go for Trinity, and everything apparently revolves around the 2 now, which is why Neo isn't ""the 1."" Wait what?!?! There were so many other directions to go in!!!Beyond that we have boring locations for action sequences (a warehouse, a bathroom, etc, vs the interesting locations of 1-3), boring fight sequences (repeating the Smith vs Anderson fight? We needed like a 5/10 nostalgia, not 8/10), dawn of the dead meets M. Night Shamalayns The Happening meets the Jedi force street sequence, and then possibly the dumbest part with Trinity floating Neo above the city (It didn't even look good LOL it looked like she was suspended... palm face).What they should have done is have a larger plot, like I don't know, the machines are still at war with eachother and threatening to destroy the planet, while one side of the machines maintains the matrix illegally and Smith has gained control of the other side or something - I spent 2 minutes coming up with that and it sounds way better, at least to me... And have the love story be a secondary but still important thing again - Trinity is going to die because the tower is in the war zone, and she needs saving, etc. It's not hard! At least Star Wars' plot was similar to Thanos' in that a significant portion of all living beings was about to be destroyed...Anyways, I enjoyed being back in the Matrix universe for a bit, it was neat. It should be over now though. Wrap it up. Hopefully someone will make an animated series or something.Cheers!",6

You can reboot Matrix from time to time.Nice one, the zombie bots. ;)The mixing of realities is perfect:Our, the movie, the World, the Matrix, the Game, the Virtual (Morpheus (nice name ;) ) (even though I see future virtuality in a form of force fields and holograms combined), the Machines reality and the dreams and beliefs (in every reality).Playing with time, in our heads, even slowing it down it's Matrix, but, to travel back in time, in the matrix? That does not belong in this fiction context, in my humble opinion.You could turn back the clock but it would work primarily on the perception/reality of the machines, and would become a paradox for Neo World Time line.You can argue but it was unnecessary.Bad choice, got taken by the same the movie tells to be free. (The system) (Money) (Power) (Ego)But then again, error validates perfection, so,Well done!Very good home work, bottom up from the source.And as it ends, behind a great men (movie) there is always a great woman (sequel) ;)Ps: Actually, the essence of the Matrix is, alternative reality, as an escape to life loops.And the aesthetic is the break of physics laws plus BD concepts.",8
2970,"This movie is a blunt and very accurate representation of the human race.Most people will not get it, and that is one of the major themes of the movie.Some people hate that the ideas were said very bluntly, but that is the point.

2971,"Two things that i miss with the new Matrixan original stylea thought provoking plotabout the plot. I think there COULD have been a new - reality questioning plot .. based on the Matrix world - but it was not found.So i doubt there is anyone leaving the cinema thinking the hard question about actual reality - which is not necessarily a big minus for a sequel.About the style .. the original one had a style that almost defined a certain subgroup of a generation. A new cool based on leather, looks and. Never before seen moves, copied by so many following movies, iconic scenes and ideas.This sequel does not even remotely come close to that.ButIs it bad? I think not. It is a competent sequel .. even a smart one. It takes the very hard job building on a trilogy that terminated. It builds on the world building of not just the trilogy but also the accompanying other media (animatrix, the computer game etc.)It does so in a solid way ... but all it can ultimately achieve is a let down.I would rate this 4th iteration of the Matrix as slightly above average. No wasted time watching it ... but it is about as useless as the 2nd Space Jam movie. (much better though)I have watched the Matrix several times .. and i always enjoyed it. It holds up very well even in 2022 ...... i am unlikely to re-watch the reincarnation part IV again though. It is forgettable in a sad way.",7

And whose idea was it to call back the background character that only garbage Jada Smith could fulfill?! Wow, what a dumper this movie is. Cheap sets, bad CGI, poor plot delivery, bad fight sequences, non meta weapon play, call back..call back..call back.. Hollywood has the China bug and anyone with sense knows Chinese have zero taste. Pure trash. Everything about this attempt to cash in.Now... lemme tell you how I really feel.",1
2973,People want to watch such movies for their amazing fiction.No need to add real life there...!Create a fictional real life and then create a fiction for it.Otherwise you're out of creativity.,5
2974,The script is so bad with balding Neo that goes in and out of character with different appearances along with Trinity is so bad and illogical. There are remade / revamped effects with characters and dialogues so out of tune that what the intent of the Matrix. Smith is Neo's boss for 60 years? Smith can kill the creator/manager of Matrix? WTF!!!,1
2975,This is an absolute disaster of a film. I loved the first film and really liked the other two. The storyline for this is so poor it's unbelievable. The action even seems like a cheap ripoff of the original which is shocking when you consider the advancements in special effects. All the new characters are forgettable at best. Poor effort to say the least and that's coming from a big matrix fan. Two stars and that's being generous.,2
2976,"Creators don't need to re-shape all films to suit the feminist approval.They could instead create new stories.Everything in this film is about men -even appearing as clowns like they did to Morpheus- are there to serve female superiority and leadership. Action starts too late but even though it lasts until the end, the movie is indifferent, like an unsalted food. All this because of the ridiculously unbalanced male/female character dynamics.",1

2979,"I knew I was going to be disappointed by this movie but I didn't expect the level of discomfort and cringeness. This film was made to follow an ""Agent Smith's"" agenda, this NOT a Matrix movie. Don't be fooled.Where the original first movie was triumphant, they took the same recipe and completely reversed it:1- They took out the unveiling of deception our world is based on (the matrix was just a videogame / imagination! How Agent Smith-esque!)2- The plot no more involves fighting for freedom (Io is ruled by a despot (old Naiobe) who cares more about growing GMO strawberries than liberating minds!). They make it simply about ""destiny"" and how it was all about Neo meeting Trinity (plain basic, one-dimension love story).3- Neo is humiliated in various ways throughout the film, they make him ""look"" old, bald, nerdy (his ""real"" appearence), the very power that defined the character, his unmatchable speed, is completely taken away from him, throughout the movie, characters keep reminding him that he wasn't the One, that they believe his mission is vain, they'll al gonna get get killed; nobody believes in him anymore. He gets insulted. And even Agent Smith, who, in previous movie always called him Anderson or Mister Anderson, now simply calls him ""Tom""...4- They took out HOPE from this film. Everyone is freaking depressed and hopeless. They made Neo and Trinity's battle's in the previous movie count for nothing : they put everyone back into the Matrix and in the more dystopian feature: Bugs tries to reassure Neo by telling him that his battles weren't for nothing since now they learned to be-friend the ""syntient"" (no longer called ""machines"" since its offensive??? GTFO).5- The Oracle was purged. Yes you red that right. There's no elements of metaphysics and wisdom anymore, only dialogues that are painfully plain.6- Too much scenes from the previous films were incorporated, as if they were there to remind us how great it was and how this new one looks dumb in comparison. Matrix Regurgitated.Was it sabotage ? Was Lana to forced to carry with a sequel that frankly, wasn't necessary at all and that nobody asked for ? The several scenes at the beginning might hint at that.",2
2980,The moment I saw the french guy starting to yell like.it was matrix 2 - i started laughing really hard.But that was the climax of the money for me.The atmosphere of the movie was bad. The actors (most of them) were not more than average. And the whole story felt kind of dumb - just to make sure the movie continues.The first original matrix got a 10 from me.The 2nd one an 8.The 3rd a 5.And this one deserves a 4.,4
2981,"This is the Matrix (1999) again, but not as goodIt's probably bottom of my list out of the now 4 matrix films2.5 hours for them to extract Neo &amp; trinity from the machine thing they were in on the first film, what a wasted opportunity, and what a waste of my evening watching it!",2
2982,"If there is one thing that the Matrix films always deliver on, it is providing an ambitious and thoughtful concept that one could never find anywhere else. The franchise has been through its fair share of highs and lows since the original classic film debuted in 1999, but even the moments that don't land take more risks than the majority of Hollywood blockbusters. All of this can be said for the new Matrix reboot, THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS, which returns to the world where the Earth has been taken over by machines that are holding humans in a false coded reality. The film is directed by Lana Wachowski, one of the two siblings who helmed the original Matrix trilogy, and the film retains the same dramatic flair and existential dialogue, even if the look and feel is different. Wachowski clearly has a great knowledge for the material of this franchise, creating a movie that uses the previous films to develop a new experience with strong messages about the state of consumer culture in media and the state of storytelling.The previous film left off with the final human outpost of Zion having just been saved by Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie Anne-Moss), both of whom sacrificed themselves to create peace between the humans and the machines, however temporary it may be. Now both find themselves living normal human lives -- Neo as a video game designer and Trinity as a regular mom with a typical good-looking husband. Both start to question their reality as the film goes on, and start to realize that the same forces of evil that plagued them in the previous films may be back and keeping them in their monotonous existence. As per usual with the Wachowski Matrix films, THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS is very confusing and difficult to comprehend for much of the runtime. The opening sequence drops the audience in the middle of a developing situation with no context as to what exactly is happening and why. Of course, Wachowski eventually explains this and much of the other confusion that pervades the first watch of the film, but even then the movie gets bogged down by the overly convoluted exposition and storytelling.All of the issues seen in THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS are the same of every other Matrix film, so the confusing plot details and irrelevant existential conversations are to be expected. However, this Matrix film delivers many positives which are new and fresh even for the stereotypically innovative franchise. The storyline is similar to the very first Matrix film (Neo is trapped in the Matrix and must discover his true potential while breaking out of the clutches of the machines), but the delivery and how it gets there creates an original experience despite the thematic callbacks. The film comments very heavily on the nature of storytelling and fiction, and how the art of creation has been commodified in modern pop culture. At first, they use the video game designer position that Neo holds as a meta commentary on the massive expectation to create a good reboot of the Matrix franchise that fans will enjoy. As the movie goes, the Matrix itself becomes a fight for creative freedom and the ability to exist as a creator without corporate powers dictating each decision.These themes were not prevalent in the previous Matrix films, and their existence here is the most fascinating and compelling aspect of RESURRECTIONS. The other fantastic addition is the new characters, most of whom end up creating more interesting arcs than the ones followed by Neo and Trinity. Neil Patrick Harris delivers one of the best performances since his How I Met Your Mother years as Neo's therapist (""The Analyst""), and Jonathan Groff lives up to his fantastic predecessor as the new version of the rogue Agent Smith, previously played by Hugo Weaving. Jessica Henwick is also an impressive find here, playing a character who I hope they bring back and expand on in future installments. The only character that did not impress me is the new version of Morpheus played by Yahya Abdul Mateen II, a fantastic actor who just delivers cheap nostalgia in place of an actual human arc.Abdul-Mateen's character speaks to a larger issue of RESURRECTIONS -- an overreliance on nostalgia to carry the film instead of compelling original moments. Wachowski often shows clips from the previous movies to let viewers know if a scene is calling back to a previous moment, and this technique is used so often that it feels like the movie never becomes its own narrative. I understand the need to satisfy the fans when rebooting a popular franchise such as this, but the plot sometimes never moves past the iconic moments of the original because the film constantly tries to reference them. It is an interesting irony that Wachowski comments on the difficulty of making original content in today's culture, yet relies heavily on the previous material in the franchise to craft the narrative.With that being said, THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS presents enough of a different and intriguing experience that it is worth the watch. The quality of this new Matrix film is similar to that of the previous two sequels, so fans will be sure to find value in the weirdness of this sci-fi adventure as they did with Reloaded and Revolutions. However, the flaws of those two are found here, and the franchise has yet to live up to the innovative and masterful first film. Wachowski proves that she has immense creativity when it comes to science fiction, and even redeems herself from the 2015 mess that is Jupiter Ascending. RESURRECTIONS definitely highlights some shortcomings and could have been a better and more satisfying reboot, but the narrative contains enough great ideas and themes that the movie fits nicely into the preexisting Matrix canon.B-",6
2983,This movie is a poorly made parody of the first movie. The secondhand embarrassment I get while watching this. What a shame!......................................................,1
2984,"This movie looks like a porn parody with all the sex scenes cut out.It's totally bad. They tried self-irony and it didn't work, they tried love and it didn't work, they tried fighting and it didn't work either, there's no plot at all, no character motivation, the dialogues are idiotic, the characters are stupid, deus ex machina after deus ex machina.",1
2985,"I mean, I didn't expect much, but even that wasn't enough. It really feels like a subpar fanfic that was put on film by amateurs. Everything about it is bad. Nonsensical storyline that is all over the place. Terrible acting. Flat and unlikeable characters. Terrible CGI. Ridiculously dumb dialogs.The movie can't decide what it wants to be: a satire on itself that breaks 4th wall in every scene, a serious love drama, nostalgia-inducing documentary, or a sci-fi epic asking ""deep"" questions. It tries to be all of it at once, jumping back and forth from one scene to another and it fails miserably at everything.40% of the movie are just flashbacks to the trilogy and old scenes re-created anew, iconic lines and elements clumsily shoehorned in every scene multiple times to the point of being cringy and outright disrespectful to the original. Red and blue pills? 5 or 6 scenes with that. Serious scenes, joke scenes, satire scenes, all variations of it, whether it makes sense or doesn't, people picking red, picking blue, rammed down your throat, almost literally. Liquid mirrors touched by two fingers? Sprinkled across the entire movie. Small mirrors, large mirrors, in ""funny"" cuts, in serious cuts. Deja vu cat? Five encounters, three ""jokes"", and counting. Repeated and abused over and over and over again until you're almost physically sick of it.CGI is terrible. It's ridiculous that the first Matrix that is 20 year old and had roughly the same budget looks so much better at everything, both in CGI and artistic vibe. Some of the decisions are plainly laughable and you could even feel the lazy thought process of the so-called artists: ""How do we indicate that people got taken control of by the Matrix agents? Oh, let's just paint their eyes solid black and run green matrix digital rain over them. Yeah, eyes in solid color = control, digital rain = matrix, see? Easy.""Again, avoid watching at all cost, especially if you're a fan. It's not worth it. A bunch of amateurs took a giant dump on the legacy of the amazing trilogy, that's what it is. Don't trust the IMDB rating, see how many copy-pasted ""10/10 perfect addition to the trilogy"" comments there are and think where they're coming from and what would be the real score without them.",1
2986,I thought the film was confusing while mildly entertaining. Seemingly the idea is Neo and Trinity were trying to be kept apart at all costs because their connection always disrupted the programming of the matrix- at least this is how I perceive it.The film tries to do a lot in a short period of time and I just don't think it was as ground breaking or entertaining as its predecessors. At the same token it wasn't a complete waste of time. I'm probably not going to watch it again and it won't hurt if you wait until this is available on dvd or to stream online. I wouldn't run out of your way to see it like I did unless you are an absolute die hard fan of the matrix.,6
2987,"It gets better the more you rewatch it.True to the core universe lore. New vilans are original.Does it feel a bit out of place? Yes, with all the new actors, it feels different, though familiar. But most viewers won't realize its been 18 years and that's a long time, the movie could not have been done otherwise. There are a lot of easter eggs and hidden meaningful plot points, but almost everyone will have missed them, as the action moves very fast.Plot wise it makes sens, and it opens the Matrix world to future spinoffs, and stories. Overall it's not bad, but it could have been a better.The bigest flaw from my point of view is having Smith returned. It feels bad, as it nulls the conclusion of the final movie of the Trilogy where Smiths got purged when defeated.Also the repeat of all the old fight scenes feels a bit cheesey and out of place. It's hard to imagine random characters poping up exactly at the location of a stealth hack entry just to start a fight scene.",8
2988,"I feel like I've just sprayed cologne into my eyeballs and that I've been huffing car exhaust. This ""film"" is a freaking joke. It's not even about anything, it's 110% predictable (i.e., there will be a fight or two and Neo and Trinity will try, successfully, to reunite). That's it. Save yourself the time. I wish I could have the 2.5 hours of my life back.",3
2989,"Llike other negative reviewers.. i just don't feel the 'uniqueness' / 'iconic' / 'The Matrix' like the previous movies.The first half bit is actually good. But then it went downhill very fast..It only serve as nostalgia, those who want happy ending and some women empowerment.---SPOILERS---Neo seems nerfed.. so much of being ""The One"" (although there are many theories) but still.. the movie include a scene how he easily defea t agent smith blocking all his attacks with eyes closed, bullet time.. and now he can't do anything.Flying Trinity.. I'm okay with that if Neo has new ability, He's a programmer who create simulation inside simulation.. what about he trapped the analyst in a created simulation of the making of The One who see through the matrix and easily manipulate it.Hey i'm all with women empowerment and feminism but don't do it in a cheap way. Is this supposed to represent equality of the rights in the matrix? Lol..Trinity and Morpheus are already iconic figure in the original Matrix.The only supposed to be 'iconic' moment is when they holding hand and come an explosion.. err.. how cheesy is that.. and so is the ending..As for new Morpheus.. i think it should cast both.. probably real morpheus in the matrix and the new one in the real life in the form of that silver particle though i understand it might contradict the story of the new city.As for new Smith.. I'm a bit biased.. I love them both.. since I love Jonathan Groff from mindhunters.Smith's story in this is actually great. So it's a plus.I probably has to praise the 'Meta' and deceiving by making video game idea. And the story about new city and Synthients. And Smith's role.I've watched it twice.. But still the bad outweigh the good.And twice i feel sad.. disappointed..End credits scene is stupid..",5
2990,"The original Matrix was one of the best sci-fi movies written. The original movie had an ingenious plot commenting on the future of society as well as conspiracies in simulation, artificial intelligence, and human nature. The original movie also pushed the boundaries of visual effects and action scenes. Unfortunately, this latest installment had none of that original magic.",5
2991,This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen.I don't actually know where to begin. If I actually saw this in the theaters I would probably want my money back. But thank God for HBO Max.,2
2992,"Watching this movie was like having food poisoning and mildly hallucinating for 2 hours!This was a problem with the director's vision and writing. Too much of the story was changed, too much didn't make sense, it was a big nasty mess I wouldn't watch again.Not all of us have changed. There's still plenty of us ""old school"" Americans who enjoy going to see a movie with a simple story in theaters and buying the movie once it becomes available. If I was directing a movie 9my goal would be for the audience to have a good time. That did not seem like the goal of this director.I'm a fan of the actors featured in the movie and I'm a fan of the Matrix franchise. Now I'd hire a new director and get a knockout enjoyable fun action script and redeem the Matrix.",1
2993,"Terrible writing and direction it headed, who got an idea that bringing so many references to first movie would work ?!?!Bed acting, even Keanu..why they did it in this state.",2
2994,"Recommend? No.(H) Rating: 2I can't believe - someone wrote this movie and said let's make this.I can't believe - actors read this script and still wanted to make it.It was trying to rely on how good the originally Matrix was by doing the same stuff, but 1000x worse.(S) Rating: 2Fell asleep, stayed asleep.",2
2995,"We were all blown away when Matrix 1 came out. It made our brains melt with this new idea. There was no chance that any sequel would ever reach that level. That being said:1 is the best2 was in second place3 was a distant thirdThis one fits somewhere around #2. Mostly for tickling our nostalgia,",8
2996,"Cheap effects, bad cast, bad acting, thin storyline gives you the b-movies vibes through the whole piece. I really had to force myself to watch it till the end. This movie is just bad.PS: sorry I forgot the boring long dialogues without any substance to enjoy.",2
2997,"The Matrix (1999) was an amazing piece of art that propelled the movie industry with revolutionary and technology and storytelling into the new millennium. Even though the sequels did not live up to it's predecessor, they still delivered ground breaking action sequences and they at least tried to dive deep into the philosophy of reality and expand the lore.One might think that a 15 year break from the franchise would give, one of the two original creators of The Matrix, enough time to conjure up a new exiting story and figure how take full advantage modern technology and push the the envelope even further. But no. The Matrix Resurrections is a uninspired, boring and extremely unnecessary sequel that ads nothing to the franchise or the lore. There is not a single moment of breathtaking awe that elevated the first movie into the hall of fame of sci-fi classics.The story is strained, uninspired and and falls flat. The special effects are truly uninspired as they only rehash what any of the CGI blockbuster have fed us for ten years or so. It feels like that The Matrix Resurrections is made by someone that got hold of the license to do a Matrix sequel without understanding what the matrix is really about or having the will to honour the legacy of the characters and the lore.",3
2998,"From what I have seen was a forced picture forced directing forced acting.I don't think the directors nor actors truly wanted todo this.Probably made for the sake of it.Well so be it... it touched me few times, on purely emotional level after 20 years of wait but thats about it.",6
2999,"I just finished Matrix 4. I would say that the film itself was good. Good actors and a decent plot. What I struggle to understand was why did they actually make it ?. It must be to build on and make more films. The end was a bit strange. And I think it seems strange if they are not going to make a No. 5. I think the end of No. 3 was good enough, so what was the point of reviving this universe if you do not build on it. So all in all good, but not sure why they made it.",6
3000,"Dont watch it.The Villains is a guy tasked with boosting productivity by using neo and trinity.New morpheus is just there to wear fancy suits and pointless jokes, new characters arent important at all they just there to make things happen. Fight scenes are simply terrible.Agent smith is there to say ""Mr. Anderson"" or ""Tom"" everything else is pointless.",1
3001,"A movie so bad our dog seized twice during it to try and get us to stop watching. We should have listened to him. (He's fine, by the way--sadly we, as viewers, are not.)This movie wasn't needed, asked for, or in any way a complement to the trilogy that so better came before it. There is nothing to get excited about and the movie manages to be terrible literally from beginning to end. Bad acting (on everyone's part) from a bad script that deliberately and directly steals from the trilogy as if the director was trying to ""meta"" this movie by injecting cash-grab pandering with 4th-wall complaints about the IP needing a revival from Warner Bros. Even if Lana Wachowski decided to direct this to only purposefully destroy any hope for future movies (which no one was craving), I think she could have handled her approach with more charm. Instead, we actually get a once intriguing character pointlessly spouting how movies and art were better in his time... We already know movies today suck. Thanks for telling us that it won't change... I think Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss knew what they were signing up for and were instructed to phone-in poor performances. It's all a sad state of events, but probably gets the message across.TL;DR1) A poor script that is more complaining about modern entertainment than anything else.2) A cast of characters you will immediately forget after getting angry that they managed to perform so unconvincingly.3) A stain on an otherwise complete story, hashed out for money by a studio/director/modern expectation of what ideas and IPs need to do. E. G. Adding cute characters that contribute nothing to the story so that toys can be made later to draw in children.The only good thing is that this movie manages to end with closure. But I all but guarantee we'll see sequels that delve more into the Machine City because that's where the CGI is and only that is what paying customers really care about--we utilized a free trial for HBOMAX and we still didn't get our movie's worth.",1
3002,"The last 30 mins was great! The rest was an absolute waste of time! Such a shame. Just boring, messy, and pointless. I think the director wanted it to feel like Inception, but it just didn't work. I really wanted to like it, it was impossible. It felt rushed in parts, unimaginative and a bit dated, which is strange seeing as the original Matrix was way before it's time. There was nothing really new brought to the table. Fight scenes were hard to follow or enjoy due to the camera work. They had an amazing formula and huge potential, but for what ever reason, they didn't build on it to make the amazing masterpiece it could have been, they made a mediocre movie with little to keep even the most hardcore fans interested. However, I did enjoy the last 30 mins of the movie, which is the only reason it's getting 3 stars, instead of just 1 star.",3
3003,"Before watching Matrix Resurrections, I watched Matrix, Matrix Reloaded, and Matrix Revolutions. I also reread Plato's Allegory of the Cave and commentary about knowing if we were shadow followers or not.I watched Matrix Resurrections with an open mind and paid more attention to the dialogue. I enjoyed the action and the special effects as well. As I watch, major themes of truth, reality choice, peace, and love played out. The questions posed throughout the movie will always be asked. ""What are you looking for?"" ""What do you want?"" ""Who are you?""Matrix Resurrections provides answers to questions raised in the earlier movies and raises new questions.In order to keep balance and harmony in the world we need to be engaged in dialogue with each other learning what reality is, what truth is, what peace is, and what love is.Matrix Resurrections provides a framework for us.",10
3004,"I am a believer of Men and Women being equal... But this movie suggest otherwise... The movie action sequences, new Animation scenes from Unreal engine... are mind blowing however... It fails to stay true to the original plot... Perhaps this is what happens when you are a Old Transgender writing the story ... Worth a watch... But Don't be surprised if you see Neo character gone smooth holding cats and Not doing what he does best....",5
3005,"I think this movie is a good sequel to The Matrix Revolutions. It includes exciting action, and great effects. I think this movie doesn't deserve itself as a stand-alone movie sequel, but if there is going to be another sequel (which has not been officially confirmed as this review is being written (26.12.21)), The Matrix Resurrections is a fair start, in my opinion.",7
3006,"Words... Where's the words when I need..Yeah, is a really garbageSo, firstly this rating (two) is only for RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE.I would like drink the blue pill to forget this movie.We really have a ""bug"" in the Matrix, looks like Thanos steal the ""Soul"" of Matrix and putted in your stone to use at fight with Avengers, because if there is a thing that don't have in this movie, is the ""Soul"" and the ""feelings"" that Matrix pass at us.I like think that Keanu was well paid for make this movie.What remains over for us?Wait for Jonh Wick 4, at least we watch a good action with Keanu 👍",2
3007,"So the Matrix Resurrections came out nearly a week early in Japan for some reason! Saw it on opening morning and was very pleased with it - it takes a fascinatingly meta approach to its own existence, and though it bogs down in the third act like every movie with a marketing budget this large, it was worth the price of admission just for the first act. Mostly a lot of fun, and as far as sequels long after the originals go, it's much more Blade Runner 2049 than Star Wars Sequels, I think. If nothing else, it justifies its existence pretty well.",8
3008,"Heartfelt, action-packed, psychological, multi-layered, stylish and varied!And also doesn't take itself overly seriously and has a good sense of humour, which I really appreciated!",9
3009,"In trying to be clever, the movie just comes across as dumb.I felt compelled to leave.The first movie changed many lives... This one just destroyed memories.",1
3010,"This Wachoscky Sis took Alice down a very meta rabbit hole! Known characters in newer, younger skins imbued with subtle differences only an unnecessary upgrade can afford! Then again, some characters have aged 20 years or so, and others around 60, yet all have the same affinity to the three heroes of lore: In the name of the One, the Morpheaus and the whole-lotta Trinity, amen! The revised platform has new rules, and newer enforcers of them, too.If it looks the same as the first one, feels similar to the first one, and leaves you feeling you missed something, then it probably was just the real, meta, sequel: uniquely invisioned! Despite its similarities, which I'm sure will be mocked and Tok'd about, it's its highlighted differences that change the display filter we view it through. It might not be a mind-fork (thanks The Good Place!), but it certainly plays dirtyly (or fork's) with your mind!The One might be an anagram of Not hee because the free are apparently still waiting for Him! There's no metaphor or satire there, just plain irony! Metaphor, Satire, Irony, and a pinch of contempt hues the film and its franchise's lovestory set against a backdrop of inimitable abuse or corruption of power, in all its forms. The lovestory is the Rosetta Stone! Once you understand the struggles one must endure for love, with all its barriers, hardships, roadblocks and detours you can juxtapose them into fight sequences, enemies, frenemies and parent-like figures in the film, metaphorically. Therefore, the internal, external and eternal struggle Neo faces against the system...I mean, matrix, for love metamorphs into one great big, science-fiction, action-packed metaphorical depiction of The Human Struggle, with or without love!Sci-Fi Epic is how future fans will see the whole series. A documentary if we cannot create change today for a different future, with or without A. I.! Or a set of mandatory-viewing films in a future where schools replace literary books of praise for films. Alongside Homer's The Oddessey, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Welles' Animal Farm and Carroll's Alice in Wonderland students will have to extrapolate all the hidden meanings in all 4 (so far) Matrix films. And write an essay about those secret messages after taking into account the Brothers' became sisters for the 4th instalment (Look it up!). Now I know many would fail: as many as today without The Matrix in the curriculum, probably! But as my reviews for The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, and The Matrix Revolutions insinuated, philosophical as they are, centred around an old-as-time lovestory, these films are worth rewatching as many times it takes to really understand the Wachoscky's minds; be they male, female or gender neutral or fluid! They are modernised biblical or legendary tales depicting society in all its layers, colours and diversity! The Good, The Christian and The Others, if you will! As bad has many shades of grey in that world, or was it this one?Hmm...Is that air you're holding?",8
3011,"Attempts within the framework of a tortured plot with the basis not even of love, but rather of the purpose of being together with Neo and Trinity, asking philosophical questions and trying deep topics - did not give colorful saturation, and to a large extent passed by. The action was greatly blown away compared to the trilogy, the world has slightly changed its balance in relations between people, machines and programs, but there is no sharp conflict in this, there are rather political games of certain participants. And some intrigue at the beginning with where and what the reality is. Many of the characters just go by the clock without standing out, just almost faceless. Nevertheless, the characters of the new Morpheus and Agent Smith pleased with worthy images and clearly confident performance. But in general, the film after the previous parts feels very mediocre.",5
3012,"Flat performance overall, the chemistry wasn't there. I wanted to like it but the story didn't engage me at all. I hope there won't be a fistful movie.",5
3013,"I love the original Matrix from 1999. Reloaded &amp; Revolutions from 2003 are teribble movies, but I can have some guilty pleasure enjoyment from those two sequels. Resurrections (2021) is very enjoyable fun with how meta it's being throughout the 2 hour &amp; 30 minute runtime of the film.However, there's a plot twist in this film that you can see coming from 10 miles away &amp; it was really dumb. The plot twist was so ""on the nose"" that it wasn't clever or sudtle in anyway possible. Just because you can make fun of the mistakes that you make with Reloaded &amp; Revolutions, that doesn't make it any less stupid, Lana Wachowski.Overall, Resurrections is another dumb Matrix sequels that can be enjoyed if you turn your brain off throughout the runtime.",9
3014,I personally loved the trilogies. They're my all-time favorites. But the story in this movie was the convoluted mess I've ever laid eyes on. The characters were poorly executed and had no substance. The plot direction left kept me asking...is this really it? What was Lana Wakowski thinking? This felt more like a cash grab than anything and was a huge disappointment to the Matrix fan base out there. Either you need to fix this or leave it be...please!,6
3015,Very smartly done. Makes a lot of references to the first three movies while introducing many unique elements. Lots of good action sequences. The greatest love story ever told.,9
3016,"Wow, I really don't know how to put this one into perspective. I had high hopes of this being a great addition to the franchise but in my opinion it was a let down. All I can really say is if you have 2.5 hours you want to spend watching this, go for it. I feel it was a waste of time unfortunately. Neo was made out to be a wuss and disrespected by old friends.",5
3017,"This movie started with a long unnecessary introduction however the action served the lack of plot.It's weird to see them full make up, losing their charisma. Anyway keanu still look gorgeous as he was in 1999.",7
3018,I love Matrix Universe and Keanu Reeve's but this movie was so empty and uninspired. I like a good love story but this was en epitome to emptiness. It was like watching a bad tribute band with the original lead singer among them.,2
3019,Finally I saw it today and I really find it really nice! I was reading so many bad reviews and I do not understand why.No action? Off course was action all the time!Boring? Not at all!Keanu war bored or without at all acting? Ehm the role of his is like that at Matrix. He was like that always.When you see it you have to remember how it ended...and make thoughts!I enjoyed very much!,9
3020,"I started watching and was intrigued, the meta approach is interesting but hard to get right, however it was so self referential it felt like spoof.After the original start the film went in a more conventional direction, however it took all the weird bits out of the original trilogy and stretched them into 2.5 hours of confusing nonsense whilst offering none of the nostalgia or originality of the original 3 movies.I would say avoid, however like the people in the Matrix, we have no free will it's predetermined that we are all going to watch it.",2
3021,"There could have been so much more. Just felt like a regurgitation of the past. Felt like it was a cheerleader of the original movie. The was original. Nothing like it before. This, felt the like the original 3 movies were thrown in a blender to see what sticks to the sides and let's put that out there. Glade to see everyone from sense8 were able to extend their carriers. Do better.",5
3022,Ughhh the acting was so bad it was painful to watch. And everything else is just badly done. It felt lazy as if it was purposefully done badly for some reason. I am not sure how can something be this bad. Isn't there feedback or some quality check before movie releases? How can they do this to Keanu man.,1
3023,"I absolutely loved especially in IMAX worth the wait I would not have wanted to see streaming on HBO that would've been not as good. I convinced my mom to see all 3 originals to see this and she loved it too we both think it's a 10! An exhilarating fun popcorn film with lots of epicness, beautiful cinematography, my favorite aspect symbolism/metaphors and humor.",10
3024,"To be honest, I still can not conclude whether the film was at least ""good"" or a total disappointment. I am overjoyed that Neo and Trinity are alive in the real world after all, although this turn of events destroyed the sacrificial end with which Neo's life ended and the his legend began. The way they managed to bring Neo back to life is solid, though I can not think the same for Trinity, who was literally torn apart by the wreckage of the ship. However, it was a good feeling to find out that our favourite sci-fi heroes are alive in this fictional and dark, yet perfect world. What caught my eye in a negative sense was the excessive use of bullet stopping, given that Neo did literally the same thing during each fight, the superficiality and shallowness of the other characters that the film actually presents us with and that we need to know much more, even though it is a fact that Neo is the star of the show, with Trinity by his side. Also disappointing is the fact that Morpheus's death is hardly explained, although he is one of the most important characters in the franchise, and who simply does not appear just because the director decided he should be dead and did not call Lawrence Fishbourne. Although the Matrix generally looks likeable, one can not help but notice the lack of that unique green filter that made the Matrix films recognizable and set that world apart from the others we have seen on movie screens. In addition, I must note the fact that the film fails to identify its antagonist. Agent Smith is neutral this time around, and maybe even one of the good guys, while the only villain, if you can call him that, the Analyst, is presented in literally one to two sentences, and there is too much, almost negligible screen time. The fact that the world progressed during those 60 years while Neo lived erroneously in the Matrix is completely logical, but the closeness between humans and machines is illogical and overly hyperbolized to me, especially with that frivolous little robot roaming the ship, reminding me more of Transformers than a serious action movie, as ""The Matrix"". In the end, the film had almost no premise of its own, other than discovering, to our great satisfaction and nurturing nostalgia, that Neo and Trinity are alive and that they will continue to rule the Matrix freely and exist in the real world. Apart from this conclusion, there is nothing else that we can define as the meaning of this film. It ends hastily, unfinished, uninteresting and unemotional, again on an overly fun and seemingly ridiculous basis.",7
3025,This movie is about love story. Nothing to do with matrix. Great movie for this generation tiktokMoral of the story: drop your kids and go with the first one who shows up.,2
3026,"The story ended after the 3rd film.The majority of the first third of this film is rehashes of what was done in the first one, they even drip 5 mins of clips from the first film in this! Talk about lazy!Nothing was added to the story, the writing was poor, the CGI wasn't impressive, they also removed the iconic green tint. It's also far too meta and self referential.This film had a high bar to hit, considering it's following on from an epic franchise; however I expected nothing and I'm still disappointed.",1
3027,Time waist to watch this one . I was bored .It did not had the energy from the other ones . They try but faild. I was a real matrix fan back in the time . The first ones still rock .,2
3028,"I, as many, really love the first three Matrix movies. Especially as a Gaming and Digitalism enthusiast this world that was build up with the movies just soaked me so much in from the first time I watched them. Since the first day back years ago when the rumor was spread that there will be a new trilogy in the works of this movies and that they will continue the first three I was more than hyped. But I always were afraid too that they maybe couldn't catch up with what they had brought to life back then. Will there be old charakters, how will they catch up with dead main charakters. I had many questions and many fears.But today I watched the movie finally and I couldn't have had more fun with it. I was in from the very first minutes straight until the end. Never I felt any lengths or was bored at any time. The story is so well written, even if it is a little bit cliché in a little part but everything else is so cool puzzled together I really were surprised. Wouldn't have thought that if this movie would be good it would be so damn good!",10
3029,Just a solid film with minor issues with great concepts and moments. It's not perfect but if you think this movie is awful your exaggerating. That climax was awesome.,8
3030,The first 40min is just horrible.They re talking about Warner brother wanted a matrix 4! It felt like a SNL show. And for 10min they made us painfully watch how this will come into fruition. This scene was plain ridiculous.The fighting scenes.I was actually bored during the fighting scenes. The camera shaking and that weird effect added on it make it so confusing(Japan train scene). I had no idea who was fighting who.The acting.Keenu reeve seemed to be in that movie against his will. Maybe that's why the fighting scene seemed so bad. The energy he had during the first matrix is long gone.The British Chinese girl Jessica Henwick was good and nice to look at.Neil Patrick was also good.I will rate 2/10 for the first hours and 7/10 for the second half when neo wakes up.,5
3031,"If you played the matrix online or at least read up about it's lore, watched the Animatrix and really love the matrix for its philosophy, then this movie is more likely to be enjoyable to you. Especially if you enjoyed reloaded and revolutions.This film, just like the other 3, is primarily about the idea of choice and free will.The action is less prevalent than the previous films though and I think that's where a lot of people lose interest.It's a great epilogue to a great trilogy and holds onto the canonical status of expanded lore.There were a few moments I hated. I felt the acting in the opening dialogue was rushed and forced and I hated ""I still know Kung Fu...""Otherwise, a beautiful ending to the story of Neo and Trinity.",8
3032,"Not so bad like many people thinking.First 30 minutes are little not so interesting, but after that its interesting if you watch carefully the story and understand what is happening.Nice effects. Good actors..Of course Neo and Trinity are most watchable. Ending is good.Well, I prefer Keanu Reeves with short hair, but..anyway its ok.",7
3033,"This movie is just bad...obnoxious and you can really see thus was not supposed to happen when they first release the original trilogy. Waste of time, luckily I watch it on HBO Max and did not spend any movie on this piece of boring garbage. They spent the first act just making fun of the first matrix just to try and be something like it afterwards. And don't get me started with the whole ""morpheus"" and ""mr smith"" are back...Just go and see the first ones.",1
3034,"Why, Ms Wachowski, Why, why, why? Why do you do it? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something? For more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace? Could it be for love? Illusions, Ms Wachowski. Vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify a movie that is without meaning or purpose. And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself, although only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Ms Wachowski. You must know it by now. You can't win. It's pointless to keep fighting. Ms Wachowski? Why? Why do you persist?",3
3035,"The Matrix Resurrections fell into precisely the same trap as Star Wars: The Force Awakens - it introduced a bunch of new &amp; relatively interesting characters, but in order to balance the new with the familiar it rehashed the plot of the original trilogy, cobbling a bunch of iconic scenes together into a messy &amp; unimaginative soup. With added Jyn Erso character for an extra Rogue One parallel. Fortunately, the villain is far better realised here than Kylo Ren ever was. In fact, the fifth star is solely down to Neil Patrick Harris' performance as the Analyst; he was easily the best thing about this movie.",5
3036,"Well, this didn't really live up to the expectations.I know it's hard, I was 16 when the first movie came out and I saw it every day for months when it was released on DVD, but this installment was probably the worst of the four.I liked the first third or so of the movie, how extremely meta it was with Matrix references within the Matrix, but then it just fell flat, unfortunately.",4
3037,"This movie references itself so much by literally playing back scenes from the old movies, you could just save your money by just watching the original ones again. The plot is abysmal, at some point they have the self-reflection to break the 4th wall to address this is a money grab from WB. It's just this bad. And several key actors like Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving seemed to have better things to do, so they have been recasted by some random decent actors...but in no way washes the bad taste of knowing what the real face should look like. A lot of tippy-talk to justify the changes as tricks of the matrix etc, but at the end of the day, those actors are missed.Terrible.Oh I wonder if they played Hans Zimmer copyright for blatantly copying The Mind Heist track onto the whole heist/rescue scene?",2
3038,"This has to be the one of the worst movies out there.There is no story, no mission no anything.... Lack of story and some way too long and loud battles... thats the summary of this movie...I am disappointed about the obvious lack of love given to this movie.",1
3039,"Tell you what guys! The movie was maybe not perfect. But way better then the most of the opinions here. Why? Maybe it was released a few years too late? Because watching it at the cinema and seeing all those people (young teenagers) walk out of the cinema, first I did not understand. Then realizing that the movie does not make any sense for all the young people and thats why the reviews are so bad. I mean com'on! Even the journalists who give the movie a bad review are too young for this! Assuming them being between 30 and 40! They were like 10 when the first movie got released!!!? How would they understand the nostalgic moments in this movie? They couldn't! They wouldn't! And were are all the 40-50 years old people who experienced this history in making movies 20 years ago and now watching a new chapter of this fantastic movie series?! I think that THEY did not see the movie yet because they're sitting at home, caring about their families and letting their children go to the cinemas!Conclusion: would the 4th part have been released about 5-10 years earlier, I am pretty sure that the reviews would have gotten much better then they are now!",10
3040,"We didn't even finish the movie! The writing, graphics, plot, all of it was a mess. It was so incredibly bad we cringed more than anything. If they were going to do another movie (which I strongly think was a mistake now) they could have done so much better. It was so disappointing.",2
3041,"Remember that awesome sequence where Neo stops bullets in the first film? He does that all the time in this one, and it does get old.Also, what are the rules again? It seems like every plot point is an introduction to a new magical ability, such as ""OK, she can fly now"", ""OK, he has complete control over time and space"".Storywise, it's basically a dragged out meta-remake of the first Matrix, complete with reused sequences from the same. It has few interesting ideas, but all poorly executed.",3
3042,"^Constant throwbacks and rehash of scenes.. the fighting wasn't as good, didn't feel as impactful.. but maybe I'm being overly critical there. Not a single good guy dies.. and trinity gets neo's powers because why not? Idk. Reminded me of flying space leia, tbh. The actors were fine, I just think it was a weak script and movie idea. I feel like there was a lot of potential, especially since this movie takes place 60 years in the future.. but they dropped the ball. Great CGI.",2
3043,"I'm a huge fan of the matrix the way they made the characters it was perfectBut now I feel like they destroyed all of my good memoriesIt begin with a story now one can imagine it was a master piece .. I was like how did the writer imagin something like thatBut with this trash I'm like ""is there is something bad more than this "" my heart is brokenThe film was empty with no msg with nothing I think they produced it to only to make us disappointed.",3
3044,It was made in the most ridiculous way possible. The Matrix had to be the same trio.Making Matrix Four was really wrong and I suggest you do not see this part of Matrix Four.,3
3045,"I was so wrong about this movie because people in videos told me so, but. But now I know, they all were just bots. Ty creators, I really neded that. Even if you are just bots.",10
3046,"I hope you read it but I bet you dont. Tell me, ok dont tell me cuz u dont read it. Its rhetorician question for me. How u have so big and long nerve to destroy movie I love THE MATRIX. I know its false of me, I get the point but.... Cmon, its a bad start with it! John Wick, we will live over it, you will bring all we need to know. I just feel it, even if im not female, I feel u inside me, you are fetus that grows like an alien and want to pop out of my chest. I want to speak and write much, but. You are creator here whatever it is, it would be funny that real you think that you are you and actually im a real Neo., uh ho. Im delusional. But Why do I feel for my entire life so? Too many moves or too much fake reality for me.",10
3047,"5/10 - but then I watched the originals back to back - and watched part 4 (twice) -it works , it really does. The end if Mi3 is a mess (and we all bitched &amp; moaned at the time) This is the closure (or re-boot) that we all needed.",8
3048,"Taking original subject matter seriously while taking the mickey out of both itself and it's predecessos is a hard nut to crack for any (soft-) reboot within a movie franchise, however this film succeeds spectacularly.This is both a parody of and a worthy successor to previous Matrix features. A worthy successor as in deepening, expanding and adding to philosophical ideas from the originals. A parody as in refusing to take itself and its characters (too) seriously. The nods and winks to how to reboot a franchise are omnipresent. Good examples are (and I don't think these relate to the actual spoilers storywise) are the mentioning of the studio's name (the actual studio that released the movie) with the ""with or without you"" quote and everything mentioned in the focussgroup related scene (where everything we later get to see is mentioned).What absolutely clinches it for me is the ending. Again, no spoilers as such. But you can just feel the anoyance of the film makers here. ""Oh yeah, you want a political correct female-centric ending? Fine, now chocke on it and here's a terrible all-female Rage Against the Machine cover song to really make it sting.""I've (we've - me and the Mrs.) haven't had so much fun watching a franchise film in a very long time. Like going from Return of the Jedi straight to Revenge of the Sith. It's like Die Hard, an action film and a comedy in one. But with reflection and philosophy sprinkled loosely upon it.But fair warning, if you are a die-hard Matrix fan and consider the original trilogy's parts 2 and 3 to be holier than scripture you will be likely to miss all the nods and winks, or be offended by them, and you will therefor not enjoy this movie.I thought it was hilarious, exiting and thuroughly entertaining!",8
3049,"The movie starts just god awful but then it gets into this weird meta satirical part where it feels like it making it bad on purpose in like a good way (if that makes any sense at all which I feel like it doesn't) I enjoyed it during the parts where it felt kind of funny but then it gets bad. There is just long sections of talking that were not engaging to me as a viewer to the point where I definitely missed some plot Then excruciatingly long fight scenes that would have been fine if they were good fight scenes but they were very repetitive, predictable, and boring. The ending kind of didn't make any sense but again it felt like satire but with how the rest of the movie felt made me think that those parts were mistakenly funny in a way. Keanu Reeves did some bad acting like worse than usual but he is Keanu Reeves so I don't really care. Jonathan Groff and Neil Patrick Harris were pretty good in my opinion.",3
3050,"What was that? I can't believe it.Cheap actors, empty dialogs, empty and lazy scenes. Zero class, zero style. Terrible replacements to legendary characters.It's just very bad movie. Very disappointing.",1
3051,"There are those who didn't want to be bothered with the philosophy, the ideas behind the matrix trilogy, who didn't want to think deeper, and thus didn't like the sequels. This movie will have the same fate. It explores several themes: what happens after the prophecy is fulfilled? How are people controlled by marginalizing their faith, their ideas, their legends, their stories. What role does human connection play in giving people power and freedom of thought. Emotion is easier to manipulate than rational thought. The balance between hope and the pursuit of dreams vs. Being held back by the fear of losing what you have.So well done, and a wonderful continuation of the original story, and even adds to the depth of the original three. True matrix fans will be enthralled and captivated.",10
3052,"After waiting and hoping for so many years for another Matrix movie I have to say this was pretty good! People will hate because their expectations weren't met or they still carry some negativity from the previous two films but rest assured if you go in with a completely open mind you'll be quite amazed. I was honestly wondering how they would kick this all off again and I think the story delivered. Super excited to see the possibilities of what may come in the future! My only hope is, if we get more movies from this, both Wachowski's are involved next time! Nothing will ever top the first movie, Enjoy it for what it is.",8
3053,"They couldn't even write a coherent story. There are too many issues to bother listing since every youtube review should cover it.At least Lawrence Fishburn can have a chuckle that he is not tainted by this garbage plot and execution.Now you know how good an actor Keanu Reeves is, I never saw this coming.",2
3054,Just felt off. Rehashing old material and uninspiring. The first matrix set the bar too high. The themes in the original were ground breaking. Nothing of note in this movie.,4
3055,"Been waiting for this, and was not let down. Good story, awesome action and great cast. After the third one, which I didn't like that much, I was pleasantly surprised. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",8
3056,"There are no spoiler in this review for anyone who has watched the original trilogy, if you didn't watch it I'd reccomend you to do it now.The beginning of the movie is good, there are a few cracks on the surface but it tries and kind of succeeds in remaining coherent with the original material with a few nice extra spins.Sadly it's all down from there, the rest of the movie is extremely rushed in multiple ways:The script develops poorly, either the writers had no idea how to continue or they didn't enough time to write something coherent; all the brialliancy of the original is gone and this movie ends up being on the same level of an average sci-fi blockbuster.The sequences of the movie were extremely rushed, the poor ideas of the script could have performed a little better if they had enough time to develop but they didn't, the characters constantly run from a place to the next one after brief and superficial conversations.The Nietzsche ubermensch who was Neo, the only anomaly who was able to bend the fake world of the machines at his will, is now a superhero with a couple of superpowers which has to rely on the ""power of love"".Regarding the CGI, well, it's good as expected but some effects were genuinely better and more visually appealing in the original trilogy which is now 20 years old and this is something that shouldn't happen.The final result is overall disappointing, the Matrix franchise would have been better without this in my opinion and I'm saying this as a fan of the original trilogy.",3
3057,"The main idea of getting the trilogy back to track was good actually, Neo being convinced that all the past memories were just his imagination as a top level game writer in a redesigned Matrix. And that's it. The scenario was a mess, bits and pieces of past three movies everywhere making no connection, poor action scenes, the cinematography that Matrix known for was just not there. Such a huge disappointment. I would never believe if someone had told me that one day I would watch a Matrix movie and wished it to end.",5
3058,Explanation for character replacement was awful.The plot in general was irritatingly predictable.Very weak character development.Sustained in the past.Rediculously empowering to women.Completely lost the spirit and wonder of the first installment.The only thing that kept me from walking out was the love story between Neo and Trinity.,3
3059,"TAKEAWAYS:1. A team of ""coders"" (to be synonymous with an underground team of ninjas/combatants) take on a mission to free known, and thought dead, legends of a simulated universe history in order to help them continue their fight for liberating the human race from the control of machines. This is The Matrix: Resurrections, and due to following a familiar framework of the prior 3 films in the franchise, it's nostalgically well done.Acts Two and Three were the most entertaining moments of the film for me, once our protagonist finally finds his footing, and the story begins to feel a little more organized.Act One felt a little disjointed here and there (especially the opening scene). There were flashbacks that I feel could have been used to set up the premise of this installment in a more intense, action packed way vs using the light-hearted, mind-boggling millennial tone it ultimately takes. Additionally, even though I had tolerable enjoyment, I wasn't the biggest fan of using the video game concept in Act One-even if it was a creative way to add to the nostalgia.SN: I don't understand why many reboots are choosing to add levity to these new installments. #NotAFan2. Similar to my feelings about my interest in the film picking up starting with Act Two, this is the same regarding the characters. This is not to say that performances were bad, they just didn't seem worth caring about-even Keanu, who was just exciting to see.As the film progressed, I found myself actually loving Seq, Tiff/Trinity, and The Analyst (although he was very predictable the moment he was introduced on screen). Everyone else were just really well choreographed scene fillers-some with more lines and initial importance than others. And yes, even Keanu came off a little less interesting as a character vs seeing him just finally get his mojo back (I was more into his body/action vs his person...).Also, Keanu's character felt a little rushed to get back to ""Neo."" It was as if editors knew that Act One's time with Keanu was going to get boring and annoying, so they quickly made it so that ""Neo"" could get the audiences back just in time.3. During the Morpheus vs Neo fight, I was a little annoyed with the following line: ""I know why you're here, why you're still fighting, why you won't give up...Come on, fight for her...""But at the time, he wasn't ""fighting..."" and technically he had ""given up"" ...I don't know why the line didn't say, ""I know why you chose the red pill even though you hesitated, so show me! Show me why you're here!"" Or something like that..4. The post credit scene... Yes! LOL5. Yeah, I think was just the right amount of screen time for Yahya.6. I agree with the Analyst...Swarm Mode was pretty cool.7. The fight scenes... eh. They were actually a little slow. The power and speed I expected came during the post credit, and it was just a few kicks.8. Okay for Niobe and Freya!9. The Matrix: Resurrections has a run time of nearly 150 minutes, and it moves quite interestingly. It's not slow to the point of being boring, and it's not fast to the point of feeling confusing, BUT there are moments where both of these points do exist--mainly in Act One, and also a little bit in Act Two with a particular loop in the Matrix/""modal.""10. Like the previous films, Resurrections continues to with a message that focuses on the importance and power of freedom/liberty/our rights to a free-willed life and the consequences that come with that life.Act One basically sets the tone for us seeing Keanu's character existing in a world and life that looks and feels too controlled.Act Two brings about the explanation to Act One-how ""The Matrix"" has pretty much evolved in order to continue exploiting energy from people through control. It also allows our main character to regain control over himself and his Self, bringing about the need for a more specific mission of freedom within the Matrix.Act Three then follows up on Act Two with completing the mission and coming to some resolution.The thematic continuity was pretty decent, but I feel it could've been much stronger with a shift in the Act One foundation that wasn't so ""light"" and actually more intentional.* * *Overall #TheMatrixResurrections is a nostalgic mashup of The Matrix Trilogy - meets The Good Place - meets Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle - meets the animal-machine splice of Leviathan by Scott Westerfield - meets the Strucker siblings of The Gifted.I personally enjoyed the film and all the nostalgia is gave despite it not being a film I think I'd watch again in the near future... far future maybe...but not near.Again, I was home with Covid during the opening weekend and week, but even from the comfort of my home watching on HBO Max I could tell it had really great theater experience quality at least. I don't know if we really needed a 4th, but if it is meant to help usher in a new generation, I guess I'm interested to see where it goes.",8
3060,"This has the feel of a Matrix movie. But has a great balance of the old and new. I believe the flash backs were great throughout the movie, but adding new characters made this feel fresh.",7
3061,I volunteer to go back in time and destroy the first Matrix movie so that it stops this movie ever being made.If anything... they should have called it remembrance or something else just as corny.,1
3062,"This unexpected chapter was entertaining and some of the new concepts pretty interesting.I must admit I appreciated the story and character motivation at a deeper level on my second watch.The reception for new faces in a beloved franchise is often luke warm to say the least, again on my second watch I found them to be less ""out of place"".Of course the original Matrix is unbeatable but in the end I found Resurrections to be better than Reloaded and Revolutions.",8
3063,"It was good seeing some of the old characters and actors in this film. It definitely had the Matrix feel to it. It started off a bit slow and a bit hard to follow at first but it delivers what the Matrix series does, lots of action. Keanu did a great job, especially the action scenes considering his age.Two things that bug me about this and the whole series. Despite being a virtual reality where they can summon any kind of weapon or have special abilities, every battle comes down to a fist fight and nobody gets seriously injured. Smith is machine based so what's the point of punching him endlessly?Second, despite raining bullets from every direction, nobody but the bad guys take a bullet. Not in the leg, arm... It's like these generic gun toting security guys are deliberately missing the target every shot. It gets a bit ridiculous after a while, like the sunglasses. Yeah we know, you're cool.Anyway, not great, not bad. Worth watching.",6
3064,"This was the biggest surprise of the year, and maybe my favorite film of the year. Not because it's perfect, because let's be clear, it's not. My biggest fear for it going in was the same fear I have for any reboot/long delayed sequel. I feared it wasn't gonna feel like the original Matrix. Or that it would be the same and outdated. It turns out it was neither. This film does something truly rare. It stays faithful to the original while simultaneously evolving it. It's so meta, to the point where it borders parody. But it all serves a purpose. Lana Wachowski (the director) understands exactly what she needed to do here. She understands that this movie was almost certainly doomed to fail. She used that and turned it into the main plot line of the movie! It's one of the most unique storylines I have ever seen. Up until the third act I was almost ready to call this the best matrix movie. Unfortunately it gets a little too silly for me at the end. All things considered this was a triumph. Although I have a feeling a lot of people will hate this movie. It's different, and it's not afraid to show it. It's goofy, and the action isn't as good as it was in the OG trilogy. But the matrix has evolved, and I'm here for it.",8
3065,"What an absolute blast! Slightly predictable and ultimately the conclusion we all wanted, but isn't that what we see movies for? It's fun when the good folks win, and people need to accept that.Not sure if there's room for another chapter but if they make another one, I'll watch it and love it too. Seeing an artist continue to paint their masterpiece is never going to get old.",9
3066,Truly loved all 3 matrix excluding this one. This is the fag version of Matrix. No offence.No words more to say but i will say this- no soundtrack or action was worth watchable or bearable.So much injustice to Neo and Trin.,4
3067,"That was like watching one of those sci-fi movies cobbled together from pieces of other movies. It was totally soulless and devoid of any feeling for any character. Neo - who cares. Trinity - who cares Morpheus - who cares. Other characters, who??? And some of the CGI was terrible. This is the kind of movie that kills any idea of another.",2
3068,"There's a massive rift between reviews for this movie for some reason. I think if you liked Reloaded and Revolutions you'll most likely really enjoy Resurrections. The story is a great continuation to the events at the end of Revolutions. Any questions you may have come up with watching the trailer and remembering the end of the last movie will be answered. Ignore all the haters and watch it. I was pretty happy with how the third movie ended, but I'm even more happy they decided to do another. After watching, it makes sense why they waited nearly 20 years.",10
3069,"The whole movie I had the feeling like i'm watching Matrix christmass parody, rather than another ep of original story. It just should have not been happen. Please wipe it out from reality.",4
3070,Loved the 4th film. Another great piece of artistry and story telling! A great ending to one of my favourite love stories.Beautifully cast as well! Only wish I had been in it myself.,9
3071,"I dug it, a few friends thought it was lameBut I really liked it. I think if you really enjoyed Matrix 1-3 then this is a worthy continuation. Was it perfect? No! Was it a good time? Yes! :)",9
3072,"Really disappointed in this, was looking forward to it but doesn't match up to the originals. Fighting scenes aren't that great and the plot a pretty bad to be honest. It just doesn't really feel like a Matrix film, feels as if they have lost what the films are about.",4
3073,"It was nice to see a new adventure of Neo with a lot of nice upgrades. The biggest upgrade is Neil Patrick Harris as a convincing antagonist. The come back story was also convincing enough to enjoy the movie, and didn't feel like it was forced. There were some cheesy moments at the end but overall, it was a good fourth installment of the series. Hope there's more.",8
3074,"Seriously?? How in Gods name do you ruin such a beautiful thing?The original Matrix was revolutionary. Similar to Anderson Silva in MMA or Mohammed Ali in boxing. The first movie mesmerised everybody! The script, the acting, the fighting choreography. All top notch. At least 8/10The Matrix Revolutions whilst never realistically being able to live up to the original masterpiece, still gave you some of the best action scenes ever put to film. The world itself seemed bigger, more dangerous and the film itself was elaborated rather nicely. A solid 7/10.The Matrix Revolutions started slower than Driving Miss Daisy and never really reached close in my opinion to delivering some unique content in which we had become accustomed to the previous 2 films.It was long, boring and some of the actors were horrible, spending far too much time on characters you did not really want to know about. But the story ended and even if you're not a fan it could easily be given a 6/10 just for having the standard anti climactic finish to a revolutionary trilogy that in the end was rushed together based solely from the success of the original.R. I. P Matrix, a disappointing end to something that could have been legendary.Move forward some years and here we are.The Matrix Resurrections. Fans (my self) go nuts and cant wait to see some inside story. Even if it was a bit average, no problems it will still give the same vibe/feeling as the first 2 hopefully.WRONG!This whole movie was like some stupid meme joke.Horrible, horrible story that i will not ruin. The only part that made sense was the Neo &amp; Trinity connection. EVERYTHING else was pure garbage.Doogie Howser as the villain? Ooh scary..Villains special powers - Even stupider than stupid could be.You spend half the movie watching a bunch of idiots mill around like it's a C grade version of ""The Office"" (great show.)All in all i feel contrite even giving this film a 5.Yet again such a waste. It's no small wonder that Hugo Weaving and possibly Laurence Fishburne said no to this film.If you go in with rather low expectations (basically expect it to be crap) and you won't be too shocked at how crap it actually is.It's definitely watchable. But only just..5/10 And pls never give Mrs.wachowsk another Matrix EVER.It was also your typical modern movie, in which they cant tolerate having a male hero. The ONLY spoiler I'll give is that Trinity is basically the one now not Neo..They basically swap roles at the end of the movie.Yea that's right.. SMH.R. I. P Original Movies &amp; even Revolutions now looks so much better.",5
3075,"First.. NO ONE can capture the same magic the original Matrix had... It was unique in every aspect and sense...The newest addition to the Matrix Franchise is hands down the second best Matrix Movie.Everyone who just looks at the plot and the action is missing the point.The whole movie is as meta as meta can be... so much social criticism and commentary, so much so that it looks like most viewers are not understanding what they are watching.. a wise man once said that not every one is ready to get unplugged from the Matrix and unfortunately it shows.I think this movie deserves waaaay more praise than it actually gets.No one should be allowed to comment until he/she/it understands the after credit scene and can explain the mega meta of it... to me this was the best after credit scene I've ever seen... and it fits perfectly to the narrative.",9
3076,This movie is so bad it does not make any sense it is just trying to exploit peoples nostalgia and the real reason why the director refuses to explain it is that he CANT. In short This movie is bad and and doesn't make any sense.,4
3077,"Everyone was expecting the awesomeness of the original Matrix, but everything evolves and changes with age. I watched it, I understood what the story was trying to say. I get it. Was it great? It wasn't bad but it was a little better than just ok. Watch, and try not to compare it to the original. Accept it for what it is and it will entertain you.",6
3078,"I was puzzled when I saw the rating. What happened with this movie, is it really so bad?Luckily for me, it was not. Yesterday I finally could see it and I loved it. A feast of recognition. Big smile all that was put into it. So much. First the comment in connection with the other movies amazing. And then the twist and yes for me it was not more of the same for me it was I don't want this to end and I really want more of this more movies. And yes I also saw the wink but I also saw a beautiful new story about the power of love. For me it is not only about the action for me it is for the wisdom that is put into it. Bu who can grasp it? That is the problem with. Lana and her sister they are too far in consciousness That is why many are left behind with the feeling what is this, I don't need this I want a straight action story plot.So thank you for this movie it gave me al lot wonderful action beautiful story humor a wink about how manipulated we are. A film to watch time after time after time. Of course you need to know the other three otherwise you are lost in this movie. Kagib.",9
3079,Worth watching for die hard Matrix fans. I watched the original Matrix movies in the cinemas.This movie basically they were desperate to keep the spirit of the original matrix movie so they basically replayed alot the scenes again word for word almost.It is good to see the old original actors who are old now . Trinity and of course Neo. But Lawrence Fishborne is missed.Some of the dialogue is good but some is just boring flat. So of course the first Matrix will always be the best .I guess the movie being made in a pandemic was understandably difficult.But worth watching still.I lost focus a few times watching it but mostly I enjoyed it.,7
3080,"The problem with re-hashes is that they try to be original, but always use the same elements of the original to prove their originality. A bit like a son trying to prove to his father that he is worth his praise by going a totally different direction. Then ending up to become the same alcoholic or tyrant, just worse, for all the wrong reasons.The Matrix #4 is doing exactly that. It brings in all the kown elements from the original movie, to bring everyone on board, either a new generation of viewers or nostalgia for those that were young when they saw the original. That is why you see characters re-emerge like the Merovingian, mocking.our modern-day lifestyle and playfully setting off boomers vs zoomers.By no means is the Matrix 4 a total failure, the way the Star Wars franchise got destroyed by basically remaking the George Lucas original, in a poor way at that.This movie is challenging some concepts in an original way, such as what is the meaning of ""Peace"", the almost Messiah-like role that was attested to Neo to save Zion. Is it a meaningful peace when we are all still slaves, those of us who brought the peace for others? What is the cost we pay for this peace? What if our freedom is a lie, used by the dark forces behind the scenes?The screenplay plays a dirty trick on the viewer however: it sets off the pragmatist Niobe in all her ""wisdom"" against the idealism of the young crew and Neo, who believe in higher values than GMO strawberries and a ""peace"" that is nothing more than compliance and in which slavery for the majority is still a fact, who are milked in their pods by the billions, just to feed the Matrix with content. And a select few can live ""freely. And eat strawberries.The makers of this movie want us to believe that we have a choice to decide who we thumb for, but manipulate us at the same time: Niobe turned ""old and wise"" and portrays the real Reason, while the idealists are portrayed as Gamblers of Faith and have little reasoning to show, except for youthful rebellion, pour l'art. They give us little encouragement to see reason in their pursuit of Liberty, while in the real world, Liberty is what brings prosperity, not slavery and compliance. No dictatorships and totalitarian system ever brought prosperity and they all collapsed much faster. The sreenplay paradoxically idealises freedom, while at the same time mocking it for being naive.The movie falls short in that while it focuses on this dilemma at the expense of visuals (which are a simple copycat of previous movies), instead of leaving this up to the imagination of the viewer and building a powerful plot to give us the free will to decide (as the director stated in interviews, not wanting to explain the controversial meta messaging), it force-feeds the solution right at the start, when Niobe explains the ""fallacy"" of wanting to stick to the guns instead of the ""progress"" that cooperation with the AI brings. The Faith that Morpheus represented is basically written off as foolishness, like some cowboy wanting to keep herding cattle when he could earn fivefold sitting in a cubicle in ""trendy"" cities. Oh how wonderful progress is and such fools to stick to tradition, they will be the first swept away by history as they cannot adapt to a New World Order.Except this is a lie, because a NWO has no ideals and following the narrative is becoming a slave to whatever agenda is ruling. Morpheus knew this and that is Faith. The producers that financed making this movie seem to want to portray a changing world as something where you are ""left behind"" if you are not willing to assimilate. What a one-sided and empty view on life..I can almost hear the slogans chanting ""science brought us all this goodness"" and the chills run down my back. And all those pesky old-skool morons who thought that AI should be fought against are nothing more than obstruction of this ""wonderful progress"" so we can now all eat our GMO strawberries that Neo's old crew could only dream of... Brought to you by your friendly GMO producing corporation. This brings the story of the Apple to mind, from the Bible. Much good it brought us..No thank you. I am not buying this message and neither should you. Free will is the only human value left when we are deprived from our humanity and put into pods, to be milked for bio-energy, protein or whatever value we represent for those who do the milking.This movie is a set-up: pretending to be full of idealism, while the real Reason (the only monologues worth paying attention to are those of Niobe, as she desribes what took place, not what dreams are built upon..) tells you to welcome AI, technology and submission to Order in your life, as it avoids war. And that the dream-like naivité of the Neo-Trinity couple is just a sidestory in the much bigger picture of Real Life.No wonder the director does not want to explain this double messaging: stating that this movie is a criticism to current global interests would never have allowed it to screen. Putting in the subliminal messaging of the contrary is the real brainwash.So much for artistic freedom..Putting all this aside, the movie has no visuals to show for, mediocre acting beside our two stars, hence the negative reviews. People want action, not philosophy or think abot their lives for that matter. The concept of The Matrix has lost its meaning to the sheeple and it is blue-pilled, while cheering for the red-pilled heroes. How ironic..Long live the Resistance! Long live Morpheus!",5
3081,"What a dumb, boring movie this was. Fought falling asleep several times during an afternoon viewing and wondered if I missed key elements, but I did not.I am still not 100% sure what the story was about.The only fan service that was worthwhile could've been better spent watching a Matrix Trilogy recap on YouTube.Wish I could go back and take the blue pill.",3
3082,"As a fan of the Matrix trilogy, I wanted so much to like The Matrix Resurrections but I was decidedly non-plussed with this reboot/sequel/Matrix revisited. Sure, the Neo/Trinity reunion is to die for, it's action scenes are still as wowza as ever, the CGIs are even more impressive and the script is littered with some über-cool dialogues, but the film's biggest let-down is its lack of originality. It leans heavily on nostalgia, reinventing the best of the fight sequences from the earlier Matrix movies and employing flashback clips to remind us how long it has been since the Trilogy series ended. Perhaps a case of if it ain't broke, don't fix it?.",6
3083,"Neo and crew reminiscing about the previous (3) Matrix movies while planning to make the 4th Matrix movie. At first Neo resists taking a Red Pill and gobbles down the Blue Pills. Then he finally breaks down and takes a Red one and goes on a hunt for Trinity to reunite with. The main body of the movie is around reminiscing about what happened in the previous (3) Matrix movies. Then they ALL hold hands and sing Kumbaya while telling Neo what a great guy/legend he is. I fell asleep towards the last quarter on the movie, it was that bad.",2
3084,"Ok so i got goosebumps in the first 1min of the movie when that matrix sound track started with the matrix coding on the screen i got excited and enjoyed it a lot, BUT... thats it after that one min nothing exciting nothing fun, just waste of time, so many plot holes so many lame scenes , the fighting is lame the idea is lame, this movies should not be made, i would forget that this movie even exists.",4
3085,The Matrix Resurrections has a lot of cool and interesting ideas but the film never utilizes these to its advantage. Instead promising fans to come back for a future installment for any sort of payoff.,6
3086,"I was looking forward to this movie as a fan of the original Matrix trilogy Unfortunately, the entire time watching this movie I couldn't believe how bad it was. It was filled with mindless action, poor character development and a idiotic storyline. I could care less about the characters outside of Neo and Trinity. The new Morpheus is a disgrace to the original. I do not have the words to describe how terrible and disappointing this movie was. The only plus is that I watched this on HBO Max and I spent money on pizza instead of movie theater tickets. Im sorry for anyone that spent money to see this in a movie theater.",1
3087,I'm so disappointed. This film just is not a matrix film. The story is all over the place and struggles to make sense. Loads of plot holes and gaps! Very little action and when there is some action it's not as visually effective and jaw dropping as the first films. It has glimpses of what could've been but I think the matrix is a finished franchise. Such a shame.,4
3088,"I rated 6 just because Reeves and Moss is my favorite actors. If it is not because of them I will rate this movie 5, 4, or ...... may be even 1.The plot is so predictable. Even the reason why Morpheus and Smith is getting younger is so predictable. No need for WB to make another sequel of this movie.",6
3089,"Through it all, Matrix Resurrections is about reconnecting with true self and true love. From the start, Neos confliction is prempted by the carnal temptation of his desire to stay connected with the matrix. Captivated in his own thoughts, while being forced, Neo chooses life over death to save himself, while being led down the altar rekindling his love with Trinity. The rest of the story is breaking free from the evil that eminates and abounds. A must watch for anyone interested with life itself.",10
3090,"While there are some positive and interesting ideas in the movie the general package is a big missFeels like a shadow of it former self.For some reason this turned to be a romantic story, and as most recent Hollywood movies it's very politically correct (but not in a good way)",5
3091,"Tried to hard to make it nostalgic and like the original movie, but without the good story or amazing effects.The whole movie I was waiting for something fun to happen, but it never came. So very glad I didn't see it in the theater but just in HBO max.",2
3092,This is a feministic orgie that smells Really bad and the aftertaste even impact the original negativily! This one should not yave been done!Weak acting. No charisma and the feministic approach just makes me fill ILL!!,2
3093,I love the original Matrix Trilogy... every single one even when many claims Reloaded and Revolutions were not good.Well... for Resurrections... I'm not a fan... I have the Matrix Trilogy box set... this movie will stay far away from that box set.This is how fan service and nostalgia done wrong. The movie actually start for me after the Train Fight... this is when I feel I'm actually watching a Matrix movie... even then I got a lot of problem with it.Before the train fight... its a Matrix parody or spoof movie... too meta to a fault... too self aware. It even for a moment felt like a Matrix documentary when the movie keep displaying the old movie footage.After the train fight... it feel like a Deja-Vu... scenes in The Matrix world were played in accordance to the old Matrix movies to a tee...for me the interesting parts when they were in IO (the new Zion) I want to know about that place more.So... Matrix Resurrections... if you know the way... just watch it online... not a movie worthy of cinema... 5.5/10.,5
3094,But if you're looking for a science fiction pop corn flick. With a bit of nostalgia. It's fine. Just fine nothing more but don't avoid. Just enjoy the cheesy parts and yo be fair in the last ten years no sci fi action flick has been that much better. Not as good as looper but better than say take shelter. Just enjoy don't compare. Nothing does to the original. That's just life.,7
3095,"I haven't seen it, but before I heard it sucked I was baffled that Lana replaced Morpheus. I love Keanu Reeves and will support all his films because he's a national treasure but the fact that this broad brought back all the original cast and tried to replace Morpheus with a black actor who is majorly hyped is awful. I watched the watchmen series on HBO and loved it and he was amazing as Dr. Manhattan but you don't replace Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus.",
3096,"Just finished watching the movie and I must say I completely understand why some people have given it bad reviews, the movie has its perks and flaws. If looked at from a standpoint where you have to recreate a series that has had an impact on sci-fi like ""The Matrix"" I can gladly say that the story concept wasn't rushed but rather written in a way that satisfies you with the plot of the movie which i really enjoyed.the way they have shown the confused neo in the beggining of the movie and the concept of the new matrix really wraps itself around you.just like the first matrix the movie engages you in the plot first. But on the other hand the execution wasn't that good at many parts of the movie the action sequences seemed a lil confusing and not that well coreographed like the orignal trilogy as well as the charecter of morphoes wasn't likeable at all given the fact that everyone who watched this movie has known what kinda charecter morphies represented in the orignal seiries. The movie had it's ups and lows but if looked at a point where you have recreate something so influencial ,you can clearly say that the plot they went with can take this series to a really complex and engaging series if executed in the right way.",7
3097,"People live in their own matrix, or the matrix given by others. In this movie, it is addressed particularly that people in Zion live in their own matrix. Why can't the audience realize that they are manipulated by the matrix of other people's comments?",10
3098,Obviously references to the original trilogy and a bit Animatrix but I thought this was a fun ride. One of the better sequels/reboots I've seen in a long time.,8
3099,"Boring, went to sleep, woke up, back tracked the movie (HBO MAX) and went to sleep again, and with the technology we have today, why were the action scenes worst than the first movie made 22 years ago? Although it seemed like you were watching the first movie with all the flash backs, hopefully this horrible experience will not trickle over into John Wick 4.",1
3100,A bit too far in its on mythologyI liked the idea. It's unexpected. The movie looks beautiful and the actors are In general great.What takes me out of it is that they are trying to be too meta.I think the original matrix movies are annoying with all the leather and freakiness but that's a product of its time I guess.People expect straight line plain superhero movies now.,7
3101,"So, i remembered when i first watched Matrix 1, lots and lots of explaining and etc so the movie could carry on a sequel, and thats exactly whats Matrix Resurrections is about, lots of explaining to end up LITERALLY saying ""there is room to do another sequel, lets see how people react to this one"".I literally loved this movie, i wasnt expecting anything from another world like Matrix 1 was.. and i really missed the ""original"" Mr. Smith.But hey, its a great movie and i would love to see the next one.",10
3102,"Just as soulless as you thought it would be. It isn't clever, original, or subversive. Visually cheap, narratively bankrupt, and an insult to one of the greatest films of all time.",1
3103,"I absolutely loved the movie, it was less about the action, and Neo moments and more about well The Matrix.The movie spoke about the following1. The writers2. The movie Studios3. Our Society4. The Actors5. Social MediaIf you pay attention to the above, you'll understand why this movie was great. The movie didn't leave you with the obvious breadcrumbs.",10
3104,"I haven't seen the first trilogy, but i have seen scenes and read about it and was familiar with the most famouse events from the original trilogy.I would definitely suggest to first watch the older 3 movies. This way it is too abstract and you cant really get into it all so it makes it a bit boring.Movie throughout is bad, there are some quite badly done fighting scenes, the fantasy in the movie does not really no the limits, at least they are not understandable for the person watching it the first time. Characters visual and behavioural patterns are childish and too ""modern"" in my opinion.From what I know of original Matrix trilogy, and from what i saw in this movie. This movie seems like a storyless remake, the idea of the producers seems like they only wanted to awake the nostalgia in prior fans by giving them a new movie with the most popular scenes and events from earlier movies. So it is just lets introduce this and that back, and make fans think oh yeah the red pill blue pill, oh yeaeh dodging bullets, ... it is even emphasized by older scenes apearing often. With that in mind making this movie is pointless, i should have better watched this originals.",5
3105,"I didn't finish the movie. It was silly and straining too hard to be truthful to the original. Hopefully, this low grade film will end the sequels. Reeves is too good for this.",4

I start to question if the Wachowski Sisters really created the first one. It was the only good movie they made. I'm sad, just sad. I really love the philosophy, the action, and the boldness of the first movie. What garbage. I wish I were in the Matrix, by the time they reload it, so I can forget I saw it.Oh, one last thing, what's wrong with Keanu Reeves, he looks as he is under drugs during the whole movie, till the end. As a hero, he should be confident and fight, but he looks weak and afraid all the time. That's no hero posture.",1

3111,"Seriously, so much hate and split black and white thinking here in the reviews. I came only to say that, although not perfect, this movie was truly an amazing experience. Seeing another Matrix movie was a little dream come true for me.I feel this movie was enough original with a lot of fan service of course. Yes I would have love to see more of the original cast, but all the actor are doing a good job and it fit the story. I'm a man and not afraid to say that the romantic story between Trinity and Neo touched me a lot. I really love what they did.Everything was spectacular and I personally feel everything that they added fitted with the lore. I understand people keep comparing other Matrix movie to the original, but c'mon. For me this movie deserve a solid 8, but because people are so extreme here, I will give it another star!It was an amazing ride and I'm so much grateful that they made that movie.Thank you.Sorry for my Frenchglish.: )",9
3112,I only have a message for the person that held this movie from happening for all these years.Thank You!Thank you for trying to save us from this abomination. This is NOT the matrix. This is undescribable to say the least. Especially for the funs of the matrix.I didn't know why Mr. Fishburne was not in this one. Now I am glad he wasn't.One more thanks goes to the director and cast for sacrificing our eyes to the god of money.,1
3113,Huge fan of the trilogy and Animatrix here 👋. Matrix Resurrections was very underwhelming. The cgi was good and the music was OK. The writing started out ok but ended up a wash.As the movie was ramping up it ended before it went anywhere. I was waiting for something to happen and it never did. The action was very bland and nothing special and the little attempt at humor (mostly) felt more akward than anything else.. I probably won't watch it again for a long time.,5
3114,"If you compare the action scenes of the previous movies are well recorded that thisand the post credit of catrix is wrong, with the group of wakos, the cristina Ricci character is short and means nothing to the story.The plot could be better, but put Neo as a looser was enough for me.",6
3115,"I went to watch it with below average expectations as all sequels usually are, Yet I found it a Soul Resurrection!! The Matrix Triology has always given me the feeling of unfinished story, there is that bit of the big picture which remained missing, that after taste .. if you know what I mean,,, and yeah! Here it is!! After almost 20 years!!18 years of waiting finally came to the deserved end!I loved each and every bit, touched me deeply, so nostalgic....I'm all in tears, this is so well made.THANK YOU!",10
3116,"I confess I had very low expectations for this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised.This movie is so Lana Wachowski that we would know she written and directed it without even looking at the credits. It is her sense of humor, her sense of style. That is the thing that marks the movie and makes it so very different from the first trilogy.The casting is amazing... and amazingly Lana: Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Max Riemelt and Brian J. Smith. Those are names we can to associate with her works, and I don't blame her. They are great.NPH was a scene stealer, as usual. I mean, he is NPH. Nothing else needs to be said.Jessica Henwick is not someone I would ever thing of casting, which I guess shows why I shouldn't ever direct or have anything to do with movie production. She was amazing.Jada Pinkett Smith left something to be desired, and so did Jonathan Groff. In the later case it is to be expected, for the same reason I wasn't impressed by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.The story was great, a whole new direction for the Matrix movies, and the only thing was ""detracts"" from the whole are the fights and chase scenes, which felt forced. Like as if WB was demanded scenes like that to be in the movie, which I really don't doubt. Some parts of the movie felt very un-Lana, and those are the parts I didn't enjoy.Not really a spoiler since it is on the credits: Lambert Wilson returning as The Merovingian was absolutely hilarious and, even if it is a clear fanservice, it was on point.",9
3117,"Spoiler Alert: This movie copies elements from Monsters, Inc., F8, and a few other movies. Like the last Terminator movie, this reboots The One to a woman adding little or no story and reduces the rebooted Morpheus to a secondary character while elevating the secondary Trinity to the primary role. Thus making both leads female while adding no substance. This might be the start of a new franchise of characters, but only time will tell.",2
3118,Not going to spoil it like most these other lame reviewers. If you are a TRUE Matrix Fan you will love it!! I didn't want it to end! It brings you for a ride and does a great job on refreshing your memory if you forgot some parts of the last 3. AWESOME JOB WB! HOPE TO SEE MORE MATRIX IN THE FUTURE!DON'T LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS GO SEE IT FOR YOUR SELF.,10
3119,The Movie simply made so sense at all. Somehow trinity is capable of flying. Neo isn't the character he once was. He basically sleepwalks through the whole movie. Storyline is awful. Everything is just made to show emancipation and as I already said: the movie just doesn't make sense at all.,1
3120,"The film is awesome!As someone who loves the complete trilogy and has also been very involved with it. Unfortunately, many people only like part 1 and don't want to think deeply about parts 2 and 3.In my opinion, these are also the people who had hoped for a sequel to part 1 that they could live with. Well, that's not what Part 4 is. Instead, Part 2 and Part 3 are deepened once again in Part 4. And elements are added that were to be expected in an AI world. Namely that there are AI nations or powers and AI that make friends with humans... I had expected that there might even be 2 matrices because there are 2 main AI nations and you can go from one to the other matrix with mirrors. Well, that might be a story for part 5...",10
3121,"This movie was over 2 hours in length and value for money.I absolutely loved every minute of it and it exceeded my expectations.I have seen a few extensive negative reviews, I guess the 20's is the era of negativity. All I can say is watch it with an open mind and appreciate the story. It went in a completely different direction than I was expecting and was incredibly creative.I would always recommend not reading reviews before watching any movie ... I like my thoughts to be my own and ironically don't like being part of a collective consciousness.",9
3122,"No Style,No Story with proper depth,No matrix action,Avarage acting,Seems like a fast cash grab project,This is not the matrix we remembered.What a shame, Lana Distroyed it again. She only started to make this film, because Keanu Reeves got more popularity after John Wick... CashGrab movie.Fans could've made a better one.",1
3123,It is summarized as follows;The plot could easily be a bad dream Cypher was having during the production of Matrix 1.It could also be the hidden movie scenario that Michael Scott was keeping in his office for 7 seasons.JUST GIVE US THE CHARACTERS WE LOBE BACK.,1
3124,"Reading the comments it's like some people didn't watch the same movie. Their complaints are literally the opposite of each other. For example, some say it's not enough like the original trilogy, while others say it's just a regurgitation with nothing new. Some say there isn't enough action, while others say there's too much. Though we didn't necessarily need another one, I still enjoyed it. For those who don't know, and that seems to be most reviewers, Lana Wachowski wrote this due to the death of her parents. Her sister chose not to participate for the same reason. The studio likely greenlit it for the same reason as other late sequels to a successful franchise - they hope to capitalize off of nostalgia. Note there will be spoilers in the rest of my review.I thought the plot made perfect sense, and I'm not sure why some people didn't get it. Yes, there are things for which you have to suspend your disbelief. HELLLOOO! This is science fiction, which is always a mixed bag. You'll get more actual science than a comic book, but creative license will still be taken. If you want nothing but science fact, stick to nonfiction. Though it wouldn't surprise me if some of the real world theories being explored wouldn't seem just as unbelievable to some reviewers. Personally, I didn't notice anything that was any more fantastic than Terminator, I Robot, Inception, or the original Matrix trilogy. So, where are we now in relation to the end of Revolutions? Basically, though Neo defeated Smith, and the Architect kept his word to end the war, another rogue program saw an opportunity and took control. If you recognize how many programs, particularly the rogues and exiles, behaved like humans, this is perfectly logical. Take down one power hungry dictator and another will rise up and try to fill the void. It's why we don't have world peace. However, this new program, the Analyst, understands human nature a bit better than the Architect and, after a few failed attempts, has created a new Matrix where there are far more blue pill people. Though the red pills are still trying to free people, they're having less and less success. The Analyst leaves IO, which replaced Zion, alone, and the free people live a relatively peaceful and vastly improved life. This was partly made possible by shifting their mindset and learning to work with some of the programs and machines that decided, after Neo ended the war, and due to scarcity of resources that caused them to turn in each other, that they too wanted to be free of the Matrix. The one major hiccup and central part of this movie is that the Analyst somehow managed to save Neo and Trinity, slow their aging, and prolong their life. This is one of those areas where we have to suspend disbelief. And hey, who knows what medical science will be able to do in the future? But the Analyst saved them and then used them as a key component to creating his new Matrix. Neo is back to being Thomas Anderson, but is now a video game designer, with the Matrix being his most successful game. He's been convinced his memories are a delusion, and he's receiving psychiatric treatment. Trinity is married to someone else and has children. Both accept the Matrix as reality and rationalize or ignore any feelings to the contrary. Neo's subconscious is strong, however, and he inadvertently creates a program that leads Bugs, one of the free people still trying to free others, to a new digital Morpheus (the original died), which subsequently leads her to Neo. Neo is rescued, and the rest of the movie is focused on rescuing Trinity. The Analyst, however, is more powerful and has more control than the Architect did, so the first attempt fails. The second attempt is a complex plan that involves Neo distracting the Architect while the rest liberate Trinity's body. There's a bit of science fiction mumbo jumbo explaining how they disconnect her body while she's still in the Matrix. Again, suspend your disbelief and move on. Those are the main points. Remove the sci-fi trappings, and it's a pretty basic plot. Boy who loved and thought he lost girl realizes she's alive and, with the help of some new friends, goes to rescue her. What's difficult about that?The fact that many of the old characters are gone makes perfect sense, considering it's been 60 years. For that matter, how many characters from the first film survived? Both the 2nd and 3rd films introduced new characters as the story evolved. I actually like the new characters, particularly Bugs. I'd have liked to see more of them, but again, compared to the original trilogy, I didn't see a huge difference. This is Neo and Trinity's story and always has been.Neo's fight scenes not being quite on par is also quite logical considering both the character and the actor are older and a bit rusty. Neo has been living an action free life in the Matrix for over half a century, and he's not given much time to get his mojo back. If anything, I thought Trinity's sudden resurgence followed by a huge leap stretched credibility. But again, I just accepted it and enjoyed the dose of female empowerment. It wasn't a deal breaker. As for Keanu Reeves, considering he is almost 60, I think he's pretty bad ass. I'd like to see those complaining do better. And while I haven't done any time comparisons, I didn't notice any real change in the level of action. It felt on par with the others, which fyi had a lot of exposition because the studio insisted on it. They didn't think the original scripts would make sense to the audience. But this film has plenty of fighting, bullets flying, vehicles crashing, things exploding, and an added bonus of people being used as projectiles literally going splat on the pavement. What more do people want?As for those missing, mainly Laurence Fishburn and Hugo Weaving, sure it would have been great to have the original actors, but after almost 20 years that isn't always possible. It's not even always possible with a sequel that closely follows. Usually the audience just has to accept it. At least here we get reasons that fit the story. Smith having a different appearance actually makes sense in regards to convincing Neo his Matrix life is real. And Morpheus is explained well enough. Don't know why the actors didn't return, and unlike some other reviewers, I'm not going to make assumptions to support my own opinions of the film. I will say, regarding Laurence Fishburn, the one comment I did see from him did not lead me to think he didn't want to participate. There are a number of reasons actors don't end up doing a sequel. This is nothing new. The new actors did a good job. They were enough like the originals to make the connection and different enough considering the time that's passed and the fact that they aren't exactly the same characters. They're both programs, one based on a living person and one an upgrade to an older program. So again, the changes make sense within the narrative.Overall, this felt very much like a continuation of the original story. We can have stories with a satisfying ending, but there's always more we could tell. As Smith tells Neo, stories never really end. For me, the best part of this chapter of the story, and a good reason for it to be told, is seeing Neo and Trinity get their happy ending. I wasn't dissatisfied with their sacrifice in the original ending as it was true to their characters. But it was also the epitome of life isn't fair. After everything they did, after making so many sacrifices, they deserved more. So I'm not unhappy seeing them given a second chance at happily ever after.",8
3125,"This is just a nostalgic movie for Matrix Trilogy fans. The plot of this 4th movie is more of the same old history, nothing too new in terms of concept. But the new thing is how this movie treat us a fan. The movie treat us as part of the history, the movie know what we know. We know that the history it self does not matter, that what really matter is to revive old characters and old special effects that we enjoyed to watch and see. The movie knows that Neo and Trinity are now too old and there is nothing elese to be added up to the history. This movie is fun, good jokes about this 4th version and warner brothers. We lost in science fiction but we gain with nostalgic. The best actor surely is Neil Patrick Harris he definetly hook us as the analyst.",10
3126,"This movie is super meta. The story is so complex I wish it was longer. I could tell WB put their hand on another movie again like they did Josstice League and made it shorter than what it should have been but they still allowed Lana to tell her story. The action was incredible but doesn't depend on it and the plot makes your imagination run wild. The story plays its hand with nostalgia and talks about how that allows the viewer to feel more comfortable while delivering a completely new story. They definitely set up this movie to be another trilogy. All of the actors were phenomenal; my only critique is, WB should have backed off and allowed the story tellers more time to better introduce the new characters and flesh out the new story line. With all that said, this movie sticks the landing and is exactly what we have all been waiting for. Go see this movie!!!!!!",10
3127,"Flashbacks to the first film remind you of that this new film isn't. First twenty minutes are so self indulgent and smug I'm surprised Nicolas Cage doesn't turn up. Acting is fairly wooden, characters don't have any enthusiasm for what they are doing, not sure if that's them trying to be cool or not. The fight scenes are really the worst part, lots of fast cuts and tight camera angles to make up for a lack style that was signature of the first 3 films. I guess I'm just very disappointed in the whole thing.",3

It's a Boy Meets Girl, Boy destroys two worlds trying to get to girl, Girl Says No, Girl Says Yes, Love Conquers All with some fighting over what reason in between, I still don't know.Entertainment Factor: Found myself wondering if I should get up and make more popcorns than paying attention to the movie.Opinion: All that dose of estrogen to wachaowaski probably got to their head and made them forget what made Matrix a winner. They tried to make a feel good philosophical dialogue and called it the Matrix instead of what made Matrix great in the first place.Save your time..and money.",3
3129,"I do wish this was a tad bit better, but I'm still really happy with what we got. Despite all its cringe and unfunny jokes, it has all the amazing Matrix action I was hoping for. It was so fun watching Keanu Reaves and Carie-Anne Moss reprise their roles as Neo and Trinity, they were great. My only wish for the casting was that they got Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving to return, but the writers worked around them pretty well.I was really hype for this movie, maybe even TOO hype, as I rewatched the whole Matrix trilogy as soon as I could. Nothing will ever touch the first film, but I was hoping this would be better than the last two. It was better than The Matrix Revolutions, but it was not better than The Matrix Reloaded. Out of all the Matrix films, I believe this one had the most complicated plot. I found some parts of this film a little hard to understand, but I got the message.This is a very solid entry to the Matrix franchise, and I'm sick of these bitchass fans completely slandering this movie. Hate when mfs rate something a 1/10 just because they didn't like it. 1/10 is UNBEARABLE, I can't sit still because this movie is so awful on every level. There are 9 other numbers you can rate this movie, this is NOT a 1/10 film. I've never even rated a movie below a 5/10, because even with those awful films, I can find something I like about them.Whatever, say what u want about the movie, but u can't deny the first trailer for this film was one of the best we've ever seen 😹🔥.This'll definitely get dislikes.",8
3130,"I enjoyed this movie. I liked the story. I liked the action. I enjoyed the new characters, and the return of the old. Been a while since I watched any of the other 3, and this was a fantastic remembering of that world. Will definitely watch again!",7

3133,"I put 10 because I don't think that current rating is fair, especially comparing to a franchise like Avengers where they fight hoards of faceless enemies in bloodless fights the same way yet those movies are all 8s. For me Matrix Resurrections is about nostalgia. It's about not giving in to the routine, but still managing to 'fly free', now that the time gradually becomes my enemy. The new Matrix is far from being perfect, but everything is better when you're a child, and this movie reminded me of some of those good old times, even though they were not as good as I perceived them. So is this movie, so my rating is 100% subjective.I had my share of good emotions from it.7/10.",10
3134,"Overall feeling is too passive (storyline and music). Where's the pounding stuff we know &amp; love?Story feels like it's missing something. Maybe a Wachowski?Was this made for the cast of Sense8? Did Lana feel they needed a job?Too politically correct. Why is Trinity the one that leads the last confrontation and can fly? Because now we must make the female the stronger character? Feels gratuitous and like it's a separate timeline from original trilogy. You wanna do alternate timeline, start over, don't close out the franchise with it.",3
3135,Nothing in thos movie will keep you watching except the lore built in the previous three parts.Nothing ever resemble the oldatrix movies at all even keanu reeves. None of the co-stars match the slightest the previouse ones.,5
3136,"When you watched a movie, fell sleep and saw she without missing any plot of story ..... that's bad movie. Like this one. What a big mess !!Storyline is really weak, at some point I thought I was watching The Walking Dead !! Why it took Neo to find his mojo ?",4
3137,"It felt like a parody of itself. Its existance didn't make sense, nor the plot, the story was weak. It felt like they wanted to make this movie only because they can cash in on it; it felt like a big excuse, taking advantage of nostalgia.The original Matrix was groundbreaking, very stylized and a classic, this one is the very opposite; an insult to the original trilogy. Even Keanu Reeves didn't look like he wanted to be there. They've repeated iconic scenes without taste and shamelessly promoted political messages. I feel sorry for the original cast :( It felt somewhat like a Marvel movie, with forced humour and constant breaks in the fourth wall.",1
3138,"Spent the whole film distracted with these questions:1. Why is there more exposition than plot?2. Why aren't Weaving &amp; Fishburne in it?3. Why is the action worse than all the previous films? Neo especially just seems slow and unless his new skill is bemusement, he appears underpowered throughout.4. Why are we being constantly shown clips of the other films from the franchise?5. How can you hang the entire plot motivation on Neo and Trinity's relationship but fail to make us believe those characters actually love each other beyond showing us old clips of them?6. Where are Neo's ""real world"" powers that were so key to the conclusion of the original trilogy?The film isn't terrible but it's not good either and relies entirely on your love of the franchise to maintain your interest.",5
3139,I thought this was good! Was surprised after reading all the negative reviews on here. Loved NPH in this. And lots of little throw backs to the first movie. Also lots of symbolism re spiritual point of view. Left the door open for another episode. More will be revealed in the Matrix...,8
3140,"Why was there a need for this story? The justification makes no sense. The storytelling is lazy. Even the CGI seems to have taken a backstep. I understand that the leads are much older but even the young actors perform physically less. Finally, apart from Morpheus and Bugs, all other support characters have zero development time. During the runtime, you don't even remember their faces. I heard that this was supposed to be another trilogy, I hope this movie makes so much loss that remaining movies are scrapped by now! The Matrix story with Neo and &amp; Trinity are done and dusted. Please make new stories if you want to milk the franchise.",4
3141,"Lacks so much originality and is shoddily executed. Not even sure who the intended audience is? What was the point of this movie? Why did they risk their lives to rescue Neo? Big gamble by Wachowski. Overproduced and overacted. Ergo. Vis a vis. Concordantly. Casting wasn't great either. Neil Patrick Harris as a villain. And ""agent Smith"" was hardly memorable. Oh well. Movies are just like tv series nowadays.",1
3142,"Ignore all the bashing of this movie, it is fantastic and I cannot believe all the poor ratings being given. Do you want more more super hero movies or something original? This is a return to originality and pays a lovely homage to the trilogy. Go in open minded and just enjoye the journey it takes you on, it is beautiful, sad and funny with some awesome nostalgia to boot. Feels like we are now lined up for an action filled sequel, I for one am psyched! Thanks Lana.",10
3143,"1st half : what did I just wasted an hour of my life for.2nd half : what did I just wasted 2 hours of my life for.This isn't even considered ""a nice try"" or ""close but no cigar""Definitely wouldn't recommend this one to any of my friends to watch.Sorry, no sorry.",2
3144,"-It's ""ok"".-I was really looking forward to this, and even though it was fine, it just felt like a SciFi channel flick with better special effects.-And I'm not just talking about the story. For once, I was actually digging the real world more than the Matrix, because the fight scenes were actually very boring. They lacked excitement... and the use of slow motion and this one horrible special effect which I don't even know what it's called (it's like scenes are blurred with a super low frame rate), which was over used way too much. It became distracting.-And about the story... I thought it was an interesting idea in the beginning with the main character but as far as the plot, I didn't really find anything interesting to the development to the series as a whole. But it did have some cool ideas with things going on in the real world.-All in all, nothing I would care to watch again.",6
3145,"The reviews here are scathing. I can understand the frustration to see the self parody and the Matrix not taking itself seriously.Yes it's a bit slow sometimes.Yes, we do miss the ""real"" agent Smith and the ""real"" Morpheus.Yes, Niobe was unnecessary and the whole Io sequence feels like a side quest. Lana Wachowsky just wasn't interested, it seems.I may add that Keanu Reeves is a terrible actor. Well, he just can't act. Same dull face, same difficult elocution as in John Wick. But the man is just so nice that we are forgiving a lot.Yet the movie isn't so bad.It's a variation of Sense8 in The Matrix universe. And Sense8 was great, much greater than this movie tbh.Carrie-Anne Moss has the same intensity as in the previous movies. I just regret she didn't have more screen time.It's a fine movie, far from great, light-years from the revolution that was the 1st Matrix but I did enjoy it more than the 3rd one.",7
3146,"Ahh, here comes the letdown of the year, albeit an expected one.Forced, unnecessary, lacking ideas brought by the original trilogy. Too many things unexplained, just skimmed through, not enough time spent in the new city which replaced Zion. Some characters feel like they're just fillers, also the choice of actors isn't the best, Lana obviously chose her friends from Sense8 series.CGI isn't the worst, but for the Matrix standards - I would have expected more.I reckon this would have taken a different direction if Andy (Lilly) was involed. Taking David Mitchell on board and swaying it towards nostalgia / love-story action flick wasn't the best choice.There are a few clever ideas uttered every now and then, Lana also tried to point out some issues of our world in a ""funny"" way... (not sure it worked?).The combat/fighting sequences lack the choreography from the original trilogy and feel somewhat unsatisfying.The new ""Morpheus"" doesn't cut it.The new agent Smith doesn't have enough screen time to shine, thus falling short of expectations as well.It's not an abomination, but surely the worst and hopefully the last entry in the series.",6
3147,Lana has a brilliant creative mind. Definitely made up for the let down of 2 and 3. 2 and 3 were good but not as legend as 1 is. This movie was a thank you to part 1. The ending was chills and goosebumps. Perfect.,10
3148,"I don't write reviews and this is my first because I had to.I understand it is so hard to accept new things to add to a masterpiece that is also very nostalgic. It doesn't matter how great you do, there gonna be criticism.I grew up with matrix trilogy and I couldn't imagine how the sequel can NOT f up the series. The movie was so much better than I expected and I believe it was a breath of fresh air to the series. It is very entertaining &amp; loved every second of it. Not 10/10 but I gave it to raise the rate.",10
3149,"Can anyone calculate? I think probably 85% of this movie is in slow motion. 3% are scenes of previous movies.All talks are explanations, never something natural.That's all I wanted to say, but it's required 150 characters to submit and here they are.",2
3150,"There is nothing cathartic about this film at all. It's not even deep, they just chopped all the other Matrix films up and made this new one. Nothing original. And why is the new Morpheus running around in pink suits while everyone else is dressed in black. I read Sophia Stewart (the original author or the matrix and terminator) Matrix 4 book, and it is light years better than this story line.",1
3151,"Seriously, is Hollywood still running out of new ideas? You do realise there are thousands or millions of fictional universes in New books to use as remakes. The world is full of creativity and creative people to make new stories. Still Hollywood reboots The Matrix because the people who originally made The Matrix trilogy gave you a loophole to do that. Trinity dying on that ship and Neo being saved by the machines because he helped them against malware called agent Smith. The machines kept parts of the old code to get all the familiar pieces to control Neo. Let me guess. Smith is going to realise he's still the old thing he was and because the old code contains said information and now he's going to do the same again. Meaning that the machines act like real life game development. Ubisoft left the glitch where Assassin's Creed Valhalla got stuck in the game when they released ""Halloween"" event.I appreciate the meta jokes about video games and now even in the era of virtual reality gaming this movie series has a place. I just hope that they didn't nerf (another meta joke gamers) Neo. He needs to stop bullets. Not just push them back.",5
3152,"For a movie that is in large part a rehash of the original Matrix movie, sharing plot and idea elements in modes that vacillate between hommage, parody and satire, ""The Matrix Resurrections"" is a surprisingly good movie. Much, I might say almost all, of this success is due to the interaction between the two main characters Neo and Trinity who show a continuing chemistry that adds heart to the story. Like the original ""Matrix"", the movie starts out strong, drags a bit in the middle, and perks up towards the end. It's not as good - how could it be when the original movie was so startlingly innovative - but it is an enthusiastic effort with decent to good supporting actors and a lot of brio. The dialogue wobbles between the profound and the banal, but, in truth, in did so in the original Matrix as well and it's easy to forgive the lapses. Lots of self-references and subtle touches that become evident on rewatching. Perhaps not a necessary movie but I enjoyed it.",7
3153,"Io???? Oh come on man, why do we need to see that Thunderdome ""happy together"" Nonsense. But seriously, the fight scenes seemed so flat. I have seen this three times and there is definitely wrong there, too much CGI? Too little heart and soul? Also there where too many PC messages in here, but what does one expect.",5
3154,"I had a few ""oh that's cool"" moments, but zero jaw drops. It seems like it was mostly written as a parody. Even the retcon doesn't land. I appreciate the shift in focus to Trinity, but not even that was taken seriously. If you asked me to make a Matrix movie that gets people to yell at the screen, shake their heads in disbelief or laugh out of disappointment, it would be this.",4
3155,"The sad truth is now a days only thing that matters is pushing a narative in our heads blasting opinions of others in our western heads non stop just like the matrix. This was the final drup in the bucket im done with new movie's done i tell you i go back to the 70-80-90's movies enough, the absolute worst movie there aint as bad at this steaming bad of horse....",1
3156,"And now from the unnecessary sequels department...And, that, pretty much sums up THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS - a title that is a confession of a studio and creator that is looking to milk a few more bucks out of a dormant franchise.Written and Directed by Lana Wachowski (one of the creators/directors of the original Matrix trilogy), MATRIX RESURRECTIONS drops us back into the Matrix that is the same, yet different, and - intriguingly enough - brings us back to Neo and Trinity, 2 characters that died in the 3rd film.Of course, this being Science Fiction/Fantasy, no one needs to stay dead, if another story can be built around them.Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss are back as Neo &amp; Trinity (this film would not have happened if they didn't say yes to this) - and they are the best thing in this film. Their chemistry is strong and any film that can bring back Carrie-Anne Moss as a lead in a film, is okay by me.The best newcomer in this film is Jonathan Groff as ""Agent Smith"" (Hugo Weaving was set to reprise his role, but had to drop out due to Theater Commitments). Groff channels his inner ""King George"" (the character that he was Tony Nominated for in the Stage Musical Hamilton) and it works well in this film.As for the other ""character/actors"" - like the characters that Jada Pinkett-Smith (the only other returning actor from the original trilogy), Yahya Abdbul-Mateen II (playing a version of Morpheus), Thelma Hopkins, Jessica Henwick and...yes that IS Cristina Ricci - they are all pretty generic and serve as plot machinations to get us from one action set piece to another.And, of course, there is Neil Patrick Harris as ""THE ANALYST"", it's an interesting, pivotal, role in this film and would have been better served being played by someone less ""well known"". All I kept thinking as I watched this performance was - ""it's evil Neil Patrick Harris""!As for the special effects/set pieces, they are ""fine"" but nothing ""special"". The first Matrix film was a brilliant, groundbreaking and mind-bending piece of filmmaking that introduced cinema (for good or ill) to ""bullet time"" - a Special F/X that has been en vogue ever since. But this film is just a mismash of CGI that is neither brilliant nor groundbreaking and the dense mythology plot of this film is not ""mind-bending"", it is more like ""headache-inducing"".Do yourself a favor and skip the Resurrection of The Matrix and, instead, check out the brilliant 1999 original - it holds up well (and is the subject of my January podcast).Letter Grade: B- (thanks to Reeves, Moss and Groff)6 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",6
3157,I grew in the 90's and the Matrix movies were a huge deal back in the day..They screwed this one up so badly that they actually ruined the whole series for me..Wont go in to detail's of the movie since i dont feel it's worth my time..Do yourself a favour and dont watch it if you are a fan of the old movies.,5
3158,"While not GREAT and possibly the weakest of the 4 if was still ok - entertaining enough once it gets going. What I liked most was it lambasting of today's media - very refreshing from a director you'd THINK would be all about TODAY since becoming a woman... I really appreciated that and made it seem grounded ironically lol. The only thing I didn't like about it was the constant flashback to something that was apparently a video game and not real life. The flashbacks were annoying and intrusive ALWAYS - but more so why were the previous movies which REALLY happened footage from the games? If Neo created the game and this NEW Morpheus model, then they should have just recreated the scenes shown WITH the new morpheus. It made ZERO sense to use the movie's footage as 'game' footage, have a new morpheus AND have a statue of Lawrence Fisburne as the real morpheus. That baffled me and I really, REALLY hated it. Also one thing that irked me was Niobi. I doubt that she lived that long and can only guess she was put in to have another POC with that much dialogue - if anything, the general (I assume) in the original script would have been The Kid. I think that would have made much more sense - even though I though Jada was good. It just seemed fishy... The movies takes a while to get going and the first 15 mins are quite lousy but then it's enjoyable - my favorite part being the return of Merv lol Other than the original trilogy movie footage my main gripes were small - trinity being the one who flew was stupid - more men suck woman good nonsense lol and the fact that there wasn't much tension or story in the REAL world outside the matrix... It's almost as if they didn't want to get people's hopes up that story could possibly be left uncontinued if this bombed so it almost ends a little too neatly...but it does leave you wondering WHAT this was all for? A mixed bag but worth a watch I guess.",6
3159,"After just sitting the through this film I have one question. What was the point?I can truly say this is the worst film of the franchise. While admittingly the tone shift between the first film and the last two of the trilogy was stark there was still some cohesion between them. This film however does not know what it wants to be. It's self referential to the point of cringe (Warner brothers have ordered a Matrix 4 game *wink wink*) The previous installments had a deeper meaning and raised philosophical questions that people are still debating 20 years later. This film has none of that. The plot is messy and there is no character development for either the new or existing characters. There is no reason for either Smith or Morpheus to be in this film at all they don't act like their previous incarnations and could of easily of been introduced as completely new characters and it would of made no difference to the plot. Neo has been turned into a one trick pony repeatedly using the same move over and over (rewatch and count how many times he uses his ""force push"" power) Trinity inexplicably goes from not knowing who she is to having powers exceeding Neo's in a matter of minutes while he had to go through a whole training sequence with Morpheus and still couldn't do half as much.There is so much more wrong with this film but I'll leave it at that.On a positive note the effects were decent and it was nice seeing Keanu and Carrie back on screen together. Neil Partick Harris also puts in a good performance.",3
3160,"Honestly? I don't get it. Watched the movie and I don't understand the story.... What the f just happened?? I'll be needing to go see it a second time I guess.So why 10 stars? Simply put to compensate for the many complaining people who gave it 3 stars or less because they didn't get it. It's a pretty brilliant plot that makes you question the original trilogy while incorporating a lot from these movies. It could've been cheap and cheesy, but it works. This movie deserves better than 3 star reviews of people who just didn't get it. Watch it again instead of just whining about it.",10

The analyst - is emotional, the machines - altought sentient , are machines, not cyborgs = they do not feel,fear,love. The only thing i liked in this movie, maybe the begining - as if the matrix was reset one more time, same but different. The movie made me laugh out loud few times - especially at the end , when Neo hangs like a pair of trunks on a cable, holding Trinity. Maybe the best thing here, was to combine both characters, and bring in The One as a complete being with both halves connected. Or when Trinity used Neo as a shield...",1

Great action and stunts, all play their roles with ease, I suppose they'll be used to them by now. Forget the original movies and look at it as a stand alone and it's not really half bad. Neo and Trinity are older and wiser, and still kicking ass, Worth a six.",6
3165,"Its like watching people watch the first movie. Everything is generic, boring and youre constantly spoon fed. Like every other generic movie that is made in 8 months and comes out every 2 weeks... I expected it to be bad and I'm still disappointed.",3
3166,"It feels like they're just trying to please the fans while not offering anything of substance.So many nostalgia call backs to the first trilogy - specifically the first movie - but it just feels like it lacks originality. So many corny jokes (""I still know king fu"") and shout outs to things that happened before. One of the characters from the original trilogy, who has seen The One first hand, returns just to pick up where the awful general from the second and third movie left off.It starts out promising and then just turns into a ripoff of itself so fast.There's a literal deus ex machina at one point, where it feels like the writers wrote themselves into a corner and just had someone who makes no sense at all swoop in and save the hero. At that point, I was just ready for it to end.And the ending was so heavy- handed, trying desperately to one-up the original's ending.There was a lot of potential here, so much you can play around with this world - so much you can do with these characters ... and instead the movie opts to point at itself rather than giving us something original.I realize the makers of this movie are people who tried really hard to make something that entertains all of us ... and they deserve props for being able to create something so revolutionary 20 years ago that can still give us sequels now. The world and lore are incredible.But I'm really not feeling this entry at all.",3
3167,"Although I clearly prefer the Original Trilogy, with the special effects, constructed sets, character development, etc., I am giving this Movie a 10 for the collective efforts.Be Cautioned - this 'Resurrection', really feels much more like a 'B-Rated High Budget Remix' that your favourite streaming service recommends you watch.",10

3170,"This movie should never have been made. Matrix Resurrections doesn't come close to having the aura of the original movies and it's an utter disgrace. The production is terrible and just about everything else. The plot was somewhat of an interesting twist on things but too redundant to the 1st movie. Like a very bad remake and an ""F"" list movie if there is such a thing. By the way, Jada Pinkett characters makeup was horrendous as an old person. That makeup person should be fired. I would say the movie was just as laughable but it's a sad reality that tarnishes the legacy of the Matrix franchise.",2

I figured 5 more minutes cannot hurt....I was hoping after the other 2 bombs rhat maybe 3rd time would be a charm and maybe John Wick balls would show up and actually bring this classic to life.But my gosh was I mistaken...A woke Matrix with lazy writing and even worse comedy.A tragedy and basically puts the nail in our coffin as to where we are as a society.I am not going to rant about every ridiculous scene.I will simply say, save your hard earned money and wait until this is running free on USA or Comedy Central which I estimate will be... Next Saturday...Disgraceful.",1
3172,"Reading the reviews I expected the worst. Started watching, expected the worst happen any moment but...it didn't. Great resurrection of Matrix; different, but interesting and enjoyable. Great cast, great acting, great special effects . Don't be discouraged by low rating. Just watch it and judge yourself.",8
3173,"LIKE EVERYTHING WITH WOKE MISERABLE LOSERS WHO ARE RUINING OUR CIVILIZATION, THEY ALWAYS TRY TO FIND THE NEGATIVE IN THINGS OR JUST MAKE IT UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE MENTAL ILLNESSES. GIVING THIS AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING MOVIE A BAD RATING IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE. OTHER PPL THAT GIVE THIS MOVIE A BAD RATING ARE SIMPLY NOT INTELLIGENT AND DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ITS ACTUALLY ABOUT. PPL THAT DON'T LIKE THIS MOVIE TOOK THE VACCINE AND LOVE ANTHONY ""I'M A BUTCHER"" FAUCI AKA THEY'RE MISERABLE SHEEP IDIOTS OF THE HIGHEST ORDER. EITHER WAY, HOPEFULLY BOTH GROUPS TOOK THE VACCINE AND WE WON'T HAVE TO BE AROUND THEM MUCH LONGER....AWESOME TWISTS, FANTASTIC ACTING, AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS, GREAT STORYLINE TO REBOOT ANOTHER TRILOGY. VERY VERY VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS MOVIE!!!",10
3174,"Its has a slower pace than the other films but i think this was the idea, you get older and you see things in a different perspective. It was great to see how everything evolved, the matrix, the real word civilisation. It'd not far featched at all, the cooperation between humams and matrix entities was a natural evolution. So happy they continued the story and did not make a side story out of it.",10
3175,"The acting, casting (especially Morpheus and the new team members) were a poor choice! And Smith was just lacking character by miles! What was more disappointing is that the action and fighting scenes looked like they were designed and executed by amateur rookies?! The fighting scenes were so boring that I actually forwarded them! And last but not least, there was no need to stretch the movie for about 2:30 hrs!I knew since I first saw the trailer that it would be a fail movie, and annoyingly, I was right!To me in the whole series, part 2 was the best! And this part should be taught on how to waste resources on a bad movie.",2
3176,"I can remember stumbling out of the first part from the cinema, which turned the world upside down and in retrospect caused a lot of conversation. The fourth part is unfortunately disappointing. You can watch the film, but unfortunately it is not enough as a continuation of the series. The film lacks the style and flair of the old parts. In addition, the story lacks a clear line. The end of the matrix.",6
3177,I recently watched parts 1-3 and after watching this I'm surprisingly shocked of how bad this 4th one is. The story is all over the place and I hate all the new cast members playing the OG characters. I didn't like the 4th wall breaking with the matrix trilogy and stuff. Visually I found the Sentinal place the coolest.,3
3178,Matrix idea died...This movie is just a copy and paste of old ideas... Sometimes with no sense...The acting is so bad... So predictable... And the general fx feel dated.RIP Matrix.,1
3179,Don't understand why people are leaving negative reviews this was by far the best we could of expected with great characters returning the only negative thing was it was like having john wick in the matrix in some parts but apart from that it was brilliant with great fight scenes and stunning visual affects if your a true matrix fan you would appreciate this film.,10
3180,"So I didn't want to rely on spoilers, and will try avoid actively spoiling anything, but I do have a few points that essentially ruined something that would have been okay.-First they should have waited as long as they needed for Hugo to reprise his role because his character without his charisma was awful.-Smith and Morpheus were pitiful portrayals, both characters were so full in the original, yet every line they spoke fell flat, largely because they skipped over their monologues with yada yada yada.-Why the **** does new Morpheus wear the brightest colors he can everywhere-It brings back the worst part of the sequels in my opinion, which is 30 minute fight scenes with exotic characters and no stakes.-So Neo never ""believed"" in ""The One"" but his powers essentially came from his belief in it?-So Neo can't fly anymore but all of this sudden someone else can?It just felt like it really didn't need to exist in the first place, but they obliterated everything great about the original masterpiece.",5
3181,"What the tile says.Cash grab? Looks and feels like it.I noticed a lot of 4s, 5s, and 6s that all read like 1s and 2s.Just awful. Save your cash.",
3182,I don't need a long dissertation to tell you that this movie is absolute trash in every way conceivable. Matrix and Matrix Reloaded were visionary masterpieces. Matrix Revolutions was a cash grab. Matrix Resurrections is an all out assault on intelligence and originality.,1
3183,Hmmmm... What is the point here?!?! Are they infected with the covid-19? A movie without any purposse besides connection of Neo and Trinity in the end... Very disappointing.,3
3184,"A failed attempt to revive the success of the Matrix franchise. A lot of flashbacks fro mthe first Matrix but some characters such as Morpheus and Agent Smith when they are played by their original actors are completely ruining the plot and the atmosphere of the film. The fight scenes are ok but we are very far from the wonderful chroegraphed scenes from the 1st one The plot leaves a lot to be desired, I expected a whole lot more from this movie. The dialogues are not as good as in the first Matrix.",5
3185,Well that would be terrible. What I would actually like would be to forget this movie ever existed and be able to enjoy the trilogy (first movie is hands down one of my favorite movies of all time. Up there with Fight Club.) without knowing this was made.On the upside I may now take the arduous path of becoming a physicist studying string theory and the like and eventually after many many years at the raw age of 89 single handedly discover the formula for time travel just so I can go back in time and not watch this movie.,3
3186,Story is ironically good but a slap in the face to the legacy of the Matrix.Action is bad.Acting is ok.Some of the returning nostalgia is nice.Worth watching at least once but I doubt most Matrix fans will want to own this movie.,4
3187,"Meta humor was good at first but it didn't last, movie when down hill fast. The story was lacking, flat and boring. The new Smith was horrible as was the Analyst character. The new Morphius was a waste and Niobi added no real value. The fight scenes were the worst, slow, you could tell they weren't really hitting each other. The ending was boring and just stupid. I have to say I'm was disappointed in the story and the acting but maybe the fault lies with the director... perhaps Lana isn't the real talent in the family or it only works when the siblings work together.",3
3188,"My relationship with The Matrix franchise is a funny one. I rebel against hype. Ironically, I don't like feeling like I'm being told what is good, what is bad, what I should and shouldn't watch, etc. I like to reach these decisions on my own. So in 1999, when The Matrix first appeared, I wasn't blown away by it. I didn't see what the fuss was about. It was only in 2003, when Reloaded was trailed, that I revisited The Matrix, and this time I was blown away. In fact, it became my favourite movie - and still is. I consumed everything Matrix related I could, and absolutely loved Reloaded and Revolutions- much to the amusement of my friends and colleagues.In 1999, The Matrix was genre busting. With the exception of V for Vendetta, the Warchowskis never really got close to besting their moment in cinema history. Speed Racer was too niche and not strong enough to be a mainstream hit, Cloud Atlas was several hours of mess, and Jupiter Ascending just tried to hard to achieve too much and ended up achieving very little. Jupiter is like the 3 Star Wars prequels, there is so much reliance on CGI that it just looks like a computer game - we've come so far in terms of special effects since the original Matrix film that everything feels so grand - just look at Avengers: Endgame for example. Which leads me on to M4. Where do you go to create another genre busting masterpiece? Answer: you probably can't.First, the bad. The video game designer parts are twee, and feel forced - like there was a desire to have Thomas Anderson relive his memories but they couldn't find a fitting way to achieve it. The concept of The Analyst is interesting, but casting someone who played Barney Stinson, Count Olaf, and Dr Doogie Howser just didn't work - I expected him to announce, ""Haaaaaaave you met Ted?"" at any moment. Such a sinister, power greedy character needed a more sinister, convincing actor. I didn't particularly like the way free programs could interact in the real world through Paramagnetic Oscillation - again, it felt it bit forced. And there's a real Ja Ja Binx moment with the introduction of Kujaku, one of friendly machines or synthient. And the new Smith just comes across as smarmy. He's no Hugo Weaving.The good. This feels like a Matrix film, but then it doesn't. Rather than being a carbon copy, it has evolved its visual language, and this is never more obvious when there is a juxtaposition of flashbacks to the original trilogy. So it's familiar ground, but not the same old, same old. Like an old friend who's moved away. Old familiars like Safi, The Merovingian, and Nyobi help establish the new order of things in The Analyst's new Matrix. The story line is ok, not groundbreaking, not terrible, but ok.So going back to the problem of being a genre busting movie in these days of Marvel blockbusters - simply put it isn't one. And it was never going to be. And herein lies the problem. The Matrix shaped a genre. The main criticism of Reloaded and Revolutions was that The Matrix didn't need them - it was a solid enough standalone movie. So has Wachowski made a third sequel that didn't need making? Yes and no. Yes, in that if M2 and M3 were unnecessary, then M4 certainly was. No, in that there are a lot of people who love the Matrix universe and want to see it explored further.I enjoyed M4. Yes, I have criticisms. Yes, certain things could have been done better, and certain castings could have been more wisely made. But I was never distracted, never bored, never found myself clock watching, and when it was over I was left wanting more from this intriguing universe.",7
3189,"My background is similar to many people here, I suspect. Saw the original Matrix in a sneak preview without any knowledge up front except a grainy 140p Quicktime trailer. I was completely blown away by it. I must have seen it at least 20 times, can dub all the dialogues and even altered my fashion style to be a bit more Neo at the time. The second movie was impressive visually but not as arresting story wise. The third film, well I didn't like it much. Some of the spinoffs like the anime were amusing but didn't really stick. For me The Matrix was always about the first movie, the 0-issue, the origin story. Brilliant.I went into this movie pretty much blank as well. I had seen the trailer but didn't read any reviews. So I wasn't really sure what to expect. But I certainly didn't expect this. The whole premise of self-referential meta-stuff and fourth wall breaking was cringeworthy to say the least. But also clever in a way. While I switched it off after the opening part, I was still curious enough to come to it later to see if it really was THAT bad. And yeah, it kind of was. While the storyline eventually bends into something half-decent, it never really gets going. I never felt any sense of urgency, threat or empathy. The characters feel mostly flat, especially the support cast. I like the new Morpheus, but the new Smith is about as threatening as an office clerk. The crew around Neo seems more designed to tick off representation boxes than form a coherent team. But most of all, the movie just couldn't make me care.The action felt stilted and stiff, lacking the excitement and dynamics of the original movies. It's all really static even though some nice effects and acrobatics are pulled off every once in a while. It lacks the cool style of the original, the awe of the amazing setpieces, the adrenaline of the action scenes and the constant threat of the machines in both the real world and the agents in The Matrix. It's like watching some particularly poor fan fiction turned into a medium budget movie.Should you watch it? If you're looking for more Matrix, no. If you're looking for an interesting take at a beloved franchise, well maybe. The Wachowskis struck gold with the first movie. Maybe it was an accident. Every next movie got worse. This instalment was highly unnecessary and adds absolutely nothing. In fact, it tarnishes a lot of the stuff that made the first one cool. But that's an interesting case study in itself.",4
3190,"The irony of the game developers coming up with stupid ideas for the 4th instalment of the game basically rings true for how bad this film actually is.I was really stoked when I first heard that this film was in the pipeline but halfway through I was thinking to myself maybe I'm going to have to watch it again to appreciate the film, 10 minutes later I'm struggling to continue to watch it and made it to the end.The original film and the subsequent double sequel is where this has to end now for me, I will never watch this film again or recommend it to anyone it's pure trash!",1
3191,"After feeling let down by the first two sequels, I really had high hopes that this film would finally redeem the franchise.I admit that I was intrigued with aspects of the film while I was watching it.But once I had watched the entire thing and had time to process it all, I came to the conclusion that this movie was absolute garbage on so many levels.The plot? Meh. It lacked the weightiness of that of the trilogy. The story was much smaller. The stakes were not nearly has high. Moreover, the story being told in this film didn't feel at all necessary, as if it has anything at all to add to the original story. Finally, the mind-bending, mess-with-your-head concepts and plot twists simply do not exist in this film. That said, I'm not sure what the writers could've done at this point without ""jumping the shark,"" since you can't really out mind-blow the first film. But they could've at least tried to do a little better than what we got.The action? I don't normally care about action, but good grief, if you're going to do action, it had better put the viewer in the middle of it. That was not the case with this film. The action felt aloof, distant, cold, rushed, and phony. This cannot be said of the first film. And even the two original sequels handled the action more adequately than this.Everything else was just felt cheap, trite, inane, dull, and tired. I don't know what else to say.",2
3192,"I was expecting it to be just as good if not better than the last 3. Instead the 1st half just rehashes the last 3 with some screenplay we have already seen a million times and a boring world where Neo is a game designer. It literally put me to sleep. The last half was pretty exciting though and decent story, but all in all it felt like the producers of this movie were lazy and just threw whatever in there. I like the new cast, the team of the new ship.",6
3193,"I have to admit that i liked the new Matrix movie a lot. It begins very confusing and disturbing i was asking myself many many questions, ""where are we"" ""in which timeline are we"" is this a prequel and a sequel at the same time? But after times goes by the road comes together, still with many questions left but thats ok. That was part from the first matrix journey.Iam impressed how the movie and the plot was set up, iam impressed of the idea behind and its implemented very well. Was it a sequel? Storywise yes, but some parts felt like a prequel. They did a very good job in creating this ""matrix"" world i was in it, and they got me.",9
3194,"My disappointment was fully realized. Matrix Resurrection is Phantom Menace all over again. Fully expected Jar Jar Binks to make an appearance. Hollywood, do yourselves a favor and quit with the 'prequel' garbage.",3
3195,"I gave 5 star because 80% of viewers gave under 3 stars based on polls &amp; rotten tomatoes official website.Next year im reach 72 years old , i went to cinema by wheelchair just to watch keanu reeves.and some legends back in action.What i can tell , it does not feel like the old days... i cant find any suprise like i watched this matrix long time ago , the feel the impact , the scene , the special move things i want to watch like back there , nowdays they dont put it again..the wars like lazy a** scripts by producer and writer that want to produce this movie at fast pace as simple and low budgets..i dont know man... why like this nowdays it goes for all movie...as die hard fan like me , i can only accept the actors scene but not for the story.. it should be like original but its not and also because keanu reeves is there &amp; I had to accepted the reality by taking the RED PILL...",5
3196,"I was waiting at least part of the story that intrigued me, but my excitement just kept going down reaching end of the story.Urm, and yeah, all the guns just look like toys with sounds and flashlights. Nobody get hurt, no clothes are broken.",4
3197,"Because of the boring, empty dialogue. Story cut around a lot, jumping from major plot point to major plot point without explanation, all the whole including probably 2 hours of horrible dialogue. Story made little to no sense with the 4th wall breaking just ruining it for me. Keanu had about 20 lines in the whole film, which were all flat and boring. Was super excited, and disappointed.",5
3198,"This movie is the epitome of what is wrong with Hollywood, 0% of creativity nowadays. Trying to milk a decent franchise for every last dime just to end up sullying its name. Basically, 1st 1/2 of the movie is Neo and friends doing the same things as the first movie just slightly reimagined. All combat scenes use exact same moves and effects as the original trilogy. I promise, you can skip this one and you wouldn't miss a thing. Glad I didn't waste my money to see this in a theater but still was a waste of time but hopefully I can spare others' if they heed my warning. Shame on you Wachowski.",3
3199,"What a dissapointment.Don't get me wrong, the movie was fantastic! Absolutely! Better than both Reloaded and Revolutions. You took it one level up.The dissapointment is that people said it was a dissapointment and there never were any.Don't know if people that can't handle ""the truth"" make bad reviewsLoved the entire movieThe only dissapointment Lana could do is to not make this to a trilogy, or at least one sequelLove the work you've done to this./A true Matrix fan.",10
3200,"I agree with other reviewers the legacy set out by the other 3 films is thoroughly trashed in this film. This is more like a geriatric attempt at the Matrix. I love Keanu movies but even he looked out of sorts in this, hopefully, last attempt at re-doing a set of classic films. Maybe the sister should leave it to the brothers to run the Matrix rather than lay waste to there work. I only gave it 5 out of 10 for Keanu and the special effects otherwise could have been worse.",5
3201,"The absences of Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving are two key people whose absences are deeply missed in this chapter of the story.The main storyline of the machines repairing saving both Trinity and Neo isn't a bad storyline and gets us back into the Matrix, but too much story is given to Bugs. If they were going to recast two of the main characters and add another main character then they should have let Neo and Trinity remain dead and start with a totally new cast and new characters.",6
3202,It seems that Matrix 4 has the same problems as the original Matrix and Star Wars Episode 9 which means it is only a popcorn flick. Behold The Matrix but if it was by JJ Abrams.STORYNeo is back for some reason I will spoil. But he's a Game developer now. And the game he made was called The Matrix by the company EX MACHINA totally not Deus Ex the video game. Totally not. Anyway. He realizes that he has once again been put back to life and feed the Matrix rather than the real world. He's with he gang but this time Laurence Fishburne is now nano bots that form a holographic human. He is at odds with his therapist's disbeliefs. Now he must get back to the Matrix.The whole movie starts itself as a joke. I'm not sure if it's an advertisement for The Matrix online or just a parody of the Market as is.Anyway this movie ads an unnecessary plot twist. Turns out ok? That Neo was brought back to life and it took a small loan of a million dollars to put his eye balls back in and become a smart human. I mean today in the Matrix this would be an easy fix with robot eyes but in the real world. Inflation is at an all time high.So Matrix Resurrections ending isn't as epic as 3 because it ruins 3 and there is no robot battle Gatling blast.The Matrix wares itself thin in those 2 grueling hours rather than being just 1 hour and 30 minute movie in a trilogy that can be watched in your rich friends SUV.SPECIAL EFFECTSSame and good as before. You will see uncanny things like practical effects being used but they look exactly the same. But what I don't like is some of the cheesy effects. How did they opt for David Lynchian slow mo effects where it's just blurry and low budget?So many scenes in the movie just take the same shots as before without understanding what made them so great and fresh. Made them even more repetitive than before Just a soulless nod to past entries.ACTINGI must say that Keanu does a bang up job with his performance. He is more human. He's funnier.MUSICSame as before but with dubstep.Anyway I really can't stand these untimely and unnecessary sequels. But if any of this sounds good to you please do watch.,6
3203,"I see what they tried to do and how clever they tired to be but no matter how you sugar coat it, it's a cash grab. To me it was the worst one of all the matrix stuff, adds nothing to the saga and if anything it insulting to everything that came before it.Is pretty and top line of cgi and effects but the story and acting is subpar.",5
3204,"They must be on drugs there to allow such ""films"" to be made. How did it come to this?To the movie: This is what happens in the matrix if you take the red and the blue pill together and stick them up your butt. You get this diarrhea of a movie.ENJOY!",1
3205,It's not the Matrix. Anything but not that. So boring and stupid. Just a fail. Lana sit in crap. My childhood are ruined. We no asked for this type of Matrix.,4
3206,"The matrix is known for its stunts/kung fu. The story had so much promise but it was butchered by Lana. The fight scenes are worse than ever. The character of Neo is not given any service, he was known for being cool but he is boring and his fighting is awful. They should not have rebooted this. Disgraceful.",3
3207,"After reading some of the first reviews I was extremely worried that Lana Wachowski might have pulled a Star Wars Sequel Trilogy on the Matrix. But it was definitely nothing of the kind.Matrix Resurrections is a true sequel. It's true that no one asked for it. But it's a true sequel nonetheless.It found creative ways to bring back characters that even in-story should already be dead, namely Morpheus, and brought them back in a new way.Resurrections doesn't break the story or changes the core of the characters we knew from the initial trilogy. If anything it shows exactly the consequences of the events in Matrix Revolutions. How there was peace for a time, but how that same peace created war and opened up the opportunity for new players to come into power and change the Matrix by removing some of the old players.The Architect and the Oracle are gone. And truth be told the story doesn't needs them anyway. The Analyst in his attempt to create a perfect Matrix where no human would want to leave it, he uses Neo and brings back Trinity based on the memories of Neo. Just like Smith was altered by Neo then so too it makes perfect sense Trinity would be changed. Already in the first trilogy the One had been split into the Two. The Oracle even says that in Revolutions when she tells Neo, that Smith was Neo. Only he was his opposite, his negative, the result of an equation trying to balance itself out.Now Trinity also carries a part of Neo because she was brought back from Neo. Something that apparently a lot of people that saw the movie just didn't understand. Same as I saw all the complaints about Morpheus be unfounded because from moment one we know it isn't Morpheus the original, but something that Neo unwillingly created.This movie doesn't ruin the previous trilogy. It just shows that the story didn't end there. It shows that things never stop changing, and that change brings good and bad things.True that some characters felt off. Niobe being the greatest one. She knew what Neo could do, she knew she was only alive because of him, and now as an older and supposedly wiser woman, she's still the unbeliever. She still doesn't believe in the One. She still can't see the bigger picture. And program Morpheus making jokes about events in the trilogy, was just his way of saying he knew the whole story, he knows he isn't the real Morpheus and because he isn't the real one than he's free to be another kind of Morpheus. Too bad so many people didn't understand that.Everything makes sense in this movie if you just stop to think about everything said, and everything that happened in the original trilogy. Morpheus is back because Neo subconscious needed him and thus created a new Morpheus based on his memories of Morpheus. Trinity is back because the Analyst wanting to harness the power of the One, knew he could only do so by bringing back Trinity and using their connection to overthrow the old powers. And of course Smith is back because just like Neo created a program version of Morpheus he also recreated Smith.What the Analyst did, in a way split the root code that makes Neo the One and some of it is now in Trinity. Which is why she's so important.This movie was never about redoing things or trying to copy the old used up formula, like so many franchises do and burn themselves because of it. This movie is about creating an entire new story that follows the events that precede it.Not only that this movie carries a powerful message about how society was back then, when the original trilogy came out and how the world is now. The Merovingian makes that perfectly clear when he says that originality ans creativity were gone from movies and books. He makes very subtle references to other franchises that have crashed and burned, because they tried to copy the initial formula with new characters. All of that is true. Books, movies, TV series are all copying or doing something already done before with worse results than the originals.This movie is even a negative critic to what society has become. To what people have become. And that to me is what is getting so many people angry at this movie. They were called out and so they don't like the movie beca they were called out on things that are happening.As far as I'm concerned Lana Wachowski did a good job, better than most have been able to do with other franchises, and she didn't just limited herself to doing a reboot. This movie isn't a reboot or a copy-rehashed-paste of the original trilogy. Instead it is picking up where the original trilogy left things and exploring new things.And for Lana Wachowski to have done that so well, in these times where we're seeing franchises be destroyed left and right, all the negativity towards this movie is not only unfounded but underserved. If you're a Matrix fan and you don't like this movie then it's because you never really got what the Matrix was all about.And of course all those that never understood the original Matrix movies are not going to understand this movie, because it not only follows on the ideas of the original trilogy but it dares to takes them further. To evolve those ideas into something more.I'm only giving this movie a 7/10 really because although the movie does moves things forward, it is playing a dangerous move. Daring to take established ideas and push them further, and there are still many things that need to be properly explained. And those things can only be explained in the next movie. It's clear that Lana Wachowski has a bigger idea in mind, with revelations that might be a boon to the saga. But we'll never know if people are either too stuck in past or too afraid to accept change.I for one welcome that change.",7
3208,"They tried, but the attempt was lacking in many ways. Neo is no longer 'the One' as he is truly only powerful when standing behind Trinity. That doesn't bother me and a strong female lead is always a breath of fresh air, but it erases the entire baseline of the first 3 moves. So once going off in that direction, the director wasted time and effort to reboot Morphious and the ship crew. Holding Neo prisoner as a game developer was the only fresh and interesting aspect of the movie. What was not fresh - the fight scenes. Clearly looked like 50-60 year olds trying to fight. None of the dynamic fight scenes of the first 3. All in all - I made it through it solely out of appreciation for the first 3 movies. I would NOT recommend this to anyone and want to forget it exists in the storyline.",4
3209,"""They took your story, something that meant so much to people like me, and turned it into something trivial.""This is an actual sentence from the movie! No, I'm not making that up. It actually is!",3
3210,"This sequel demands patience. In fact, one could go to the concession stand and return halfway through the movie and not miss any action.Reliving segments for understanding of prior installments are a drag. Anybody who didnt see the first 3 wouldnt get this release anyhow.Theres a real hint of feminism with the strongly applied trinity was neros real power. Its truly evident towards the end when ""the one"" is rescued by his love interest.For me, it would have been a streamer at best or a prime rental at 2.99.",5
3211,Loved it. It was just meta enough. It made me enjoy the first 3 movies even more. I thought the conversations were perfect and that the movie didn't over-rely on action as it did in some of the earlier films.,9
3212,"I might make another account just so I can give this movie two bad ratings. Never go full Battlestar galactica. Actually...I preferred Battlestar Galactic to this movie. I'll always come back for more Keanu. But not this one.While I watched it, I found myself wishing I was in the matrix so that I could be tricked into liking this movie.I wish I would have folded my money into paper airplanes and thrown them out the window, because that would have been a more enjoyable way to use the money I spent on this steaming pile of a movie.",1
3213,"If you're interested in knowing what happened after the great machine war in Matrix 3. It's still fun to watch.If you start to compare the plot, cinematography and dialogue it kinda falls apart. The viewer relationship to the characters is purely built on nostalgia which isn't enough to make you care about the conclusion of the plot. Added to that you have wierd dialogue options that feels completely out of character for both Neo and Trinity. At a certain point they say stuff in a way that you'd hear from a 80's movie.Some how the fight scenes feels less refined than the previous Matrix titles. If you watched the first Matrix you could almost feel the impact of each hit and the filming captured everything beatifully. This movie does not do that.",6
3214,"I think the poor rating here is a little harsh. I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would. The story is about as good as it could be and I didn't guess the twist at the end which worked for me. Given that most stupid people don't know they're stupid kind of worries me at this moment, as if I had guessed the ending early on I would have been laughing at the movie and probably given it 5 stars! I had had a few though when I watched it. Maybe I'm now making an excuse for being thick! Worth a watch! And if having watched it and criticised it you don't know what I'm talking about then the the last laugh is on you!",8

3216,"I watched the first film 40 times. I know the series well. I am well-versed in philosophy and I am not dumb. I can safely say it added nothing to the franchise. It also didn't inspire me, which is a good indicator that there was no depth to it and I didn't miss some hidden meaning. Just a simple love conquers all story with too much action and too much hype music.",2
3217,"Put all expectations aside, and try watching this movie without speculation beyond what you were hoping it might be ""nothing short of spectacular"" and you will find that it almost lives up to the hype that almost made it invigoratinly brilliant !!!

3220,"That's a fact, all of the movie is about ""not doing that again"", all the main characters seem to be convinced that (almost anything they're talking about - and then, doing) is not a good idea, but they keep on doing it... for some reason. After the first hour, I was believing that, it's just another ""Matrix reloaded"", but then later, things really get moving and the final half hour is really worth seeing*** SPOILERS ***I do love happy endings, even if them make no sense at all. It's like in cartoons, Popeye will always win in the end, even if he runs out of spinaches.And super-Trinity really kicks asses, worth seeing.",9
3221,"Sometimes you just should leave something in the past. And so it was with the 2021 movie ""The Matrix Resurrections"" from director Lana Wachowski. Of course, with the popularity of the original trilogy, then I can understand why they wanted to cash in on this franchise. But come on...Personally, I think the movies have been gradually sliding downhill ever since part one, with each movie becoming more and more of a farce.",10
3222,If you need THAT MANY video callbacks to the original story then you're working with a weak script. My mind wandered off so many times during the movie and I always came back to realize I hadn't missed anything. The thing that this movie drove home was that they turned it into something meaningless......a video game. While is it was used as a trope in the movie it hit home as it's own self-review of how poor the storyline was. This was a money grab. Nothing more.,3
3223,"Just watched it here in Belgium. How much I like Keanu and how big a fan I was of the first movies, this one just felt so unnecessary. It's not a bad movie, but it has really zero purpose except to tap into some nostalgic feelings and it doesn't do it all that well. Even the special effects aren""t ground breaking at all. I even had a feeling Keanu felt the same, almost looked like he was wondering what the hell he signed up for. Big pass for me.",5
3224,"No matter what they say, it is amazing to see this world again. So some people say it wasn't like they were expecting but it is the first movie after the trilogy, for this reason, there were so many explanations about what happened. So my suggestion is to lower your expectations because It is a bridge movie to connect the trilogy with the new one but I am pretty sure the next ones will be amazing. I am really excited to see what is going to happen in the next movies. We must be honored to be able to watch The Matrix again.",10
3225,"The fight scenes were also unremarkable and I stayed a lot longer than I should have, walking out after 1h45.It would've been better if that film has not been made, as other than paying paychecks, it was a waste if everyone's time.",4

Thirty minutes in I had to go to Wikipedia to read the plot summary with the hopes of reading something that would keep me interested...it didn't work.

I, like you, was a little disappointed with the sequels that followed (though probably less critical).This movie has been in development for, like, 10 years, and I think it shows. How do you resurrect something that ended so poinently? But then you have to remember the ending, where the maker and the oricle talk about the next version if the matrix. Well folks, they gave it to us. You can be mad.if you want that cast members are different or whatever, but then You miss the point. This film is merely a call back to one of the greatest franchises of all time, and gives Trinity the credit she fully deserves.",8

It has to be a cash in cuz if they were trying a reboot..

Plus when it's over the ""fresh and original"" line is comical cuz this was not.-Bullet Time now seems a self-conscious statement saying we are making a serious thinking movie .. or a parody. I'm not sure which.-The reasoning for the resurrections was like Huh? Billions of human batteries produce more electricity because of Neo &amp; Tiff's relationship?-Fight scenes, close up, jumpy. Gives the impression of doing just enough to get by.-Morpheus turned into a happy go lucky kinda guy. The whole human race enslaved, still, but my mood is much improved cuz ~I'm Singing In The Rain~-The end scene : Without a doubt the greatest shape shifting special effect in the entire franchise history (&amp; include the Wick franchise) is when Reeves smiles. I didn't recognize him for a bit. I wonder if it was a stunt double.-About the end scene again. I thought the Analyst had been killed by Agent Smith or at least Smith had taken over the Matrix.

You can definitely feel that Keanu Does not want your money, it's Warner brothers wants the money, and WB can do it with or without Keanu, Keanu reluctant to do the 4th sequel because the 3 episode completed the story.All you have is nostalgic, one after another, actually the whole movie is an old man nostalging his old time.

Yet the present movie is overall a ""better movie"" in terms of all the filmatic elements that go into making a film, and more pleasant to watch from beginning to end.The Matrix Resurrections gets very high marks for how it handles the predecessor movies and takes everything in an entirely new directions. Extremely creative and thought-provoking which is most certainly part of what the creators intended.With this movie there is a solid basis for continuing The Matrix series into the future, if the creators so intend.It's nice to see the creators of a cinematographic enterprise not just hang on over such a period of time, but also to prosper.",8
3238,"The action scenes are absolutely terrible, and the plot is all over the place. It doesn't seem well thought out.This is the only movie I've actually wrote a rating on, because of how disappointing I thought it was. I really didn't like it.. at all. In the beginning, there were some parts were Neo started shaking and blurring the camera in a way that was just not necessary. The fight scenes sometimes were so long that they just got boring. This movie really took away the magic of the Matrix Trilogy.",3
3239,This movie does not do anything well. Action and sfx are worse than in the original. Story and writing are absolute garbage with many cringe moments and bad acting.

So you do not need to rewatch the originals.For the first ten minutes I thought this would be a budget version of the original given the unknown actors amongst a few of the more recognisable ones. However, it improves as the story unfolds and offers an alternative end to the previous trilogy.If there is a sequel, a new storyline is needed.Other than that. There are some funny moments thst poke fun at the franchise and some new tricks.4DX felt pretty violent with this movie. Maybe skip it if you don't feel like being thrown around like a ragdoll.",7
3242,"I have spent my entire childhood desiring another matrix movie. I remember spending hours on Internet forums reading fan theory after fan theory about how the matrix could end up with a sequel. After watching the three original movies, one could always find something new in these movies even after 2 decades of consistent viewing... so when I saw that there was going to be a new matrix movie, I had all of the highest hopes in the world....Until the movie dropped and wound up being pathetic garbage. That is the only two words that can sufficiently describe the monstrosity that is the matrix resurrections. Since there are so many parts of the movie that I absolutely hate, I feel like it's only fair to start off with what the movie does fairly well. First off, the unreal engine looks fantastic. The colors are so bright and vibrant. I think it's really sad that they ditched the original overwhelming green theme that were present in the original trilogy, but at least the color scheme looks great. They also do a really good job of recreating scenes from the original trilogy and making them their own. They reuse a lot of old set pieces and it kind of feels like taking a trip down memory lane.The new cast also did a lot better than I expected them too. Neil Patrick Harris kills it as the analyst. I'm really hoping that this movie opens the door for him to start playing in a lot more serious action movies. In a non Shakespearean movie, Harris is the most Shakespearean actor there is. If you are looking for a fresh face on the blockbuster action movie set list, add Neil Patrick Harris. He adds a certain twang to the tone of the movie, and I love how mystical his character is. Personally would rather have seen him play Smith, but that's not what we got. However, there's no exaggeration; Neil Patrick Harris nails his role. It's sad to see such a talented actor wasted in such a substandard film.One other really good thing that this movie managed to get away with was the score. I think a good part of this movie relies off of nostalgia for the old trilogy and much of the soundtrack is taken directly from those old movies. While they do sprinkle in some new pieces, much of the old soundtrack is omnipresent.I truly have no idea how they managed to mess up their own creation so bad. Each other movie in the franchise had a deliberate theme and answered the question, ""what is the matrix,"" in their own unique way. The first one, the matrix is a measure of control. The second one, the matrix is only part of a bigger control scheme. The third one, the matrix is the bridge of dependency for humans and machines. Resurrections? No idea. No really. I gave it a good bit of thought about the matrix and they gave absolutely no good explanation as to what the matrix is supposed to be. Much of the lessons in this movie are so abstract. The film spends literally 2 and a half hours trying to explain what the matrix and utterly fails in the worst way possible. The matrix used to be philosophical. Even in the sequels, the matrix has always been very focused on epistemology and existentialism. This movie has none of that. They took the amazing philosophical ramblings we grew to love and threw them right out of the window.How is it possible for a movie from the same franchise to have worse effects and worse cgi than its counterparts released more than 20 years ago? The original trilogy had a perfect mix of CGI and practical prop effects that looks real. The old movies managed to withstand the test of time, but this movie looks like it came out before all the three. We used to get amazing choreography matched with cutting edge cgi out of this series. Now we get Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss acting like pieces of wood in over zealous slow mo with absolutely nothing resembling the original series' choreography or effects. No seriously. Go back and watch the first three films, and make note of the cgi and special effects and then go and watch this one.They do so much damage to the original characters and who they are supposed to be. Neo was not a force user. He fought with his bare hands and feet. He did not push people around and snarl his teeth when people shot at him. No. He stood up smugly, lifted one hand, stopped a cloud of bullets and then invited an entire group of mercenary programs to have their way with him. In this movie, we get neo moaning and groaning and clearly got all of his combat training from a discount Jedi academy. I'm not taking old age as an excuse for this. If Keanu can still play in John wick and own it, then he can do the same for this role which got him on the map in the first place. They literally trashed the character of Neo so they could get out of having to choreograph a fight sequence. He can't even fly. Neo isn't the only character they tarnish. They absolutely trash Niobe too. Niobe is a stuck up piece in this film. She's not the stern, talented, and respectable ship captain we traveled through the mechanical lines with. No. In this movie, we meet Niobe who now hates everyone and everything. Remember when Niobe said she didn't believe in the one, but believed in Neo? Yeah. That went right out the window. I am ashamed of how they treated Niobe. Some characters are very difficult to recognize because of how much terrible makeup and discount customs they smother all over them.Lana wachowski does not know how young people talk. I have never seen a more in vain attempt at trying to sound like a young person ""speaking the lingo,"" than I've seen in this movie. It is probably the most cringe inducing feature of this movie when it shows some of the ""modern time,"" ways of speaking. Nobody says ""b t dubs."" Nobody goes into an office siting and says that they are ""mega shook."" They even literally say the name of the production company as a pseudo attempt at being funny I guess?This movie was made in protest. In a world where reboots and sequels are ever rampant, Lana Wachowski directed this movie with no intention of making it good. The whole movie kept giving hints about how reboots and sequels are a grueling process. It almost felt like the screenwriters were complaining to the audience that we wanted this movie; how dare us ask for a sequel to a movie we love.I always try to give new movies the benefit of the doubt especially one as sought after as this one. However, in this case, the benefit is the doubt. I urge anyone who is a true fan to the original trilogy to look at this movie with bitter disgust. We did not deserve such a bad trilogy and everyone involved with the writing and production should be ashamed that they managed to mess up such a beloved trilogy so much. Thanks for breaking my heart.",5
3243,"You get almost what you want from this movie: the atmosphere, the stunts, time play with new tricks but no good sfx. Seriously, the visual effects were so substandard even for a drama movie. I just could not buy certain moments because of their poor quality. In my opinion, it was the simplest part if you make a sequel. It would have been such a nice movie if the creators had found better specialists or invested more.",7
3244,"I'd say criminally underrated movie. I wasn't particularly happy with the end scene after the ending credits. I waited that long for a cat discussion, I was hoping to see the main characters again.I absolutely loved the movie and will definitely watch it again.I also lost all faith in critics and their ratings. Lana even managed to get a decent performance from Mrs Jonas who is probably the worst actor ever.",10

Made even less believable using non-athletic actors/actresses. Pointless excessive exaggerated fighting, killing (75 counted dead, but twice that implied). The CGI of buildings etc., although well done, seem unrealistically complex while defying basic middle school physics. Summation: Laughingly unreal. Storyline is confusingly disjointed. No or few vague explanations; no flow translates to no enjoyment.",4
3247,"The thought had always gone through my mind of what could have happened after the 3rd movie, they didn't necessarily divert from the source material but they took what was amazing about the matrix and turned it completely upside down, I fully understand what's they've done but can't take the fact that neo has been made into someone that just uses the same old tricks non stop in this movie, the fight scenes are nothing to be amazed at and the annoying close up shots really annoyed me, I liked some parts of the movie but it wasn't enough for me to say that this was worth bringing it back.",4
3248,"As a big fan of the original and hearing mixed reviews I must say I was surprisingly impressed with resurrections.Agreed it isn't the strongest of stories but they tried to do something new whilst making a film for the fans. I had fun and enjoyed it. Some good action, emotion and great chemistry between neo/trinity.Think the 1/10s on here are pretty harsh, granted it's never going to beat the first one but it's 110% better than revolutions!",7
3249,"Let me begin with the negative: the fight scenes were bad for a Matrix movie. This is not to say they were actually bad fight scenes but the fights of the Matrix trilogy were, for lack of a word, iconic: the introduction of bullet time in the original, the martial arts, the Lobby, the freeway scene, the Burly Brawl, the final face off in the rain. They were like watching a dance, and as crazy as the fights can get they're easy to follow and brilliant to watch. And for those reason I feel that the fight scenes in Resurrections felt 'sloppy' in comparison - hard to follow and incredibly busy.Now that we have that out if the way, I think this was a overall fun movie and bought a new level to the mythos. There was a bit I thought was clunky at time, the lack of Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne was disappointing but made sense for the story (though I feel they could have still been worked in and actually added another level to the story).I can see why a lot of people did not like this movie, along with the fight scenes the general tone of this movie was very different but I personally enjoyed the topics they brought to this with the ideas of human nature, fears, emotions and accepting of reality around you. For all its flaws it was fun. If you go into this movie with the mindset that this will be different - that it is not a reboot or a retelling, but the world has changed and so has the tone - I think you'll enjoy it.",8
3250,"There is a tremendous gap between the ""original "" Matrix movies and resurrections in all aspects : very poor script, cinematography, fight scenes , at the point you feel like watching a parody/ documentary.The actors performance was not convincing as well.To summarize, very disappointing movie ...",5
3251,"Another movie where because of a history it's really easy for viewers expectations to get in the way of enjoyment - and the old cliché - familiarity breeds contempt.So I don't want to fall into that trap.For the most part, it was fun being back in the world of the Matrix again, and from a technical production point of view, this movie is extremely slick and seamless - which definitely adds to the fun factor.It was also good to see some generational change in the characters - a bit of a reminder of just how long 20 years is.Perhaps it was my attention flagging, but I couldn't help feel that there were a couple of plot holes, some things that needed a little more fleshing out. This made parts of the story feel disconnected and also left me with the feeling that the conclusion left out a few threads so didn't feel fully resolved.Even so, this is a good entertainment for the holidays.",7
3252,"What a pathetic movie, they slaughtered the trilogy, the characters, the artt . There isn't a single good thing about this movie.Plot: -100/10weak , cashcow that makes no sense., Retconned so many unchangeable factsAction scenes: 2/10As much you can expect from buch of 60 year olds playing role of superhuman characters in their 20sCinematography:It's patheticComedy:Cringe.",1
3253,"I never seen a movie that systematically tries to undo everything important in the previous films. It's almost like this movie was made by ""the suits"" that we are warned about in the original film. I don't blame Keanu- it looks like he was forced into this; and it shows. I hope most people won't swallow this pill.",4
3254,"Seems IMDB doesn't like this one. For me it's the best of the Matrix sequels so far and that comes as a surprise.As everyone I loved the original and found the two sequels ok-ish but not really worthy to talk about much. The new installment changed that. When I heard they're gonna do another, I wasn't excited. 20 Years later - how could this be anything else than a complete ripoff to make some bucks?But boy was I wrong. Resurrections feels more like the original than the sequels and it plays with a good bunch of humor exactly with the expectation I just described. It knows the heritage well, fools around with it a lot and sets up a new enough path to go on further. It looks gorgeou, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss are doing a great job and also the new additions are playing well into the existing universe.After the rather lukewarm two follow ups I really can't understand how this new sequel gets so much hate. Go and see it - it's a Resurrection indeed! BUT be sure to watch the original trilogy before to have it fresh in your mind, The Matrix Resurrections plays with all three predecessors, their storylines and their Iconism like it is common knowledge and believe me you don't wanna miss any of it.",9
3255,"TLDR: The first Matrix movie was revolutionary; the sequels were okay, and you can skip this one unless you want to know what happens to these characters in the future.Before this movie came out, I was conflicted about how good it might be. The fact that Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne weren't returning bothered me. I wasn't sure how they would execute the same action with a much older Keanu and Carrie Anne-Moss. Even the visuals from the trailer were just so so. I hate to say I was right to be concerned.I think what this movie does best is expand the lore and answer a handful of questions that hardcore fans might wonder. If you want to know what happened after all these years to Zion and the original cast from the trilogy, you'll get a few answers here. If the trailer for this movie hooked you (it was an admittedly excellent trailer), then you'll get all your answers as to how all of this is happening in the film, to begin with.Beyond that, this is mildly entertaining. I'm surprised, considering Keanue successfully resurrects all his old characters in other recent movie releases. This suffers from the same problems from the original sequels: there's too much CGI, the story jumps around all over the place, and some character arcs are stretched out or unneeded. Some characters function as fan service but don't push the plot forward.There's also a social commentary on our society but more so our relationship with modern storytelling and the business of Hollywood. It rings hollow and comes off as the executives and director complaining about the current state of moviemaking through thinly veiled character dialogue. That, plus the fact that they re-used so many shots from the trilogy, felt insulting to me; it felt less like nostalgia and more like lazy moviemaking.I liked the world that has been built (or rebuilt) here but wished the story, characters, visuals, and action had more polish and less reliance on bizarre social commentary and nostalgia. I reluctantly want to see more. This movie at least proves that the world of the Matrix is still worth visiting in a TV or movie series. I'm just not excited to rewatch this one.",7
3256,"Brilliant. A brilliant mixture of the past and present. More insight into what it was and where it is to lead. Movie is 2 1/2 hours long, I was standing for more than a 1/3 of it. Locked in. I'm 44. Late bloomer. Didn't watch the trilogy until several years after they came out. Didn't get it. Watched them all a couple years later. I got it then. Why is my age important? Cause I remember the world prior the current one. Our current world is the combination of the Matrix and Machines. Endless cycles of despair, negativity, and drudgery. Before you see this movie, watch the Trilogy again. Only then, can it truly be appreciated.",10
3257,"I was waiting for an epic finale for the Matrix sequel, unfortunately I had a nostalgic review for the past three movies ,it is so disappointing.The visual effects were great in the previous movies and the momentum of the story was suspenseful and exciting on the contrary to that movie.",4
3258,"This was one of those projects where purely by making it they were guaranteed to please some people and really upset others. It actually references this in the film but theres a very strong sense that WB said to the Wachowskis ""Were going to make a Matrix 4, you can either make it with us, or we're gonna just go and do it anyway"", and as a result this is what has come out.If you make a film set in the Matrix universe but don't have any of the original characters or locations your screwed. If you remake the original film with the same characters (*cough* Star Wars *cough*) your screwed. So what do you do? You mash the two together, and the Matrix 4 does exactly that.Keanu is phoning it in for the vast majority of the film. Nothing really stands out from him in terms of his performance or dialogue, its nice to see him back as Neo but there's a couple of sequences where I hate to say it but his acting is genuinely awful (for those who've seen the film, ""the bathroom scene"".)Yahya Abdul-Mateen IIs performance could either be perceived as refreshing, an interesting take on the character and ""fun"" or alternatively could be viewed as a complete mockery/dis-service to Lawrence Fishbourne, I couldn't really make my mind up about it, the main pickle for me though was that this ""reinvented"" version of the character didn't seem to make any sense to me, or at least it was poorly explained in my opinion.Groff is good as a bad guy, but is not very good as Smith. In the same way as you can view Morpheus in contrasting ways, this applies here. Good dialogue, good performance, but shouldn't of been Smith in my opinion, should of just been a ""new"" enemy.The three stand-out performances are Carrie-Ann Moss. Jessica Henwick and Neil Patrick Harris. Henwick practically carries the film on her shoulders for the first 2 acts, then takes a back seat for the third act so you-know-who can take center stage, Moss is superb in every scene, not down to action but mainly dialogue and performance, really solid, really pulls the audience in and you care about her. Neil Patrick Harris is essentially the new big-bad, and they introduce a very unusual concept that Neil uses to good effect, he has great dialogue and serves as a menacing, annoying badguy which is what his character was all about.I've seen a lot of people be negative towards the music and sound, I thought it was really, really good, with those familiar Matrix sounds weaved in and out throughout the film, I really liked the music in the action sequences and i'm so glad that with the exception of Jefferson Airplane they didnt ""Suicide Squad"" it by ramming loads of 60s/70s popular classics to try and make it cool, they didnt, even with callbacks to Propellerheads and Rage Against The Machine.So with that being said, why is this film getting so much hate? Why do we have a load of 10/10 reviews (which by the way its incredibly obvious some are bots to bump the rating up, but I believe a lot will be legit) but also a lot of 1/10 reviews? I think I can some it up - the plot.In 5 years time if people are talking about this film, they won't be talking about the characters, they wont be talking about the action scenes or the dialogue or anything like that, they will be talking about the plot. The plot is such an extremely risky self-aware concept that i'm actually amazed they had the balls to go with it, and I think that actually for the most part it genuinely works.When I watched this film, for the first 15 minutes I was absolutely dismayed, angry even. I though to myself ""oh god they've just remade the original"" - if you haven't seen the film yet and your reading this, you will likely feel the same, you need to stick with it, you need to let it grow into what it is, and you need to genuinely concentrate to understand the concept of what they are doing. Initially its a very, very negative outlook, almost ridiculous, but once you get over the first hurdle and realise it actually makes sense it settles in quite nicely.The Matrix Resurrections is a very strange film, it looks and feels like the Matrix, but it also doesn't, it sits along side the original 3, but at the same time it doesn't, it ventures out to do something no other film has done before, but again, at the same time, it doesn't. The film feels to me like they wanted to respect the original trilogy, but also do something new, and instead of going all-new characters in the same universe, or going all the same characters and remaking it, they mashed these two concepts together and just about got away with it.The film isn't amazing, but it certainly isn't terrible. Its interesting to see the demographic of age groups and where the votes sit within that. I personally am 35, a big fan of the first 2 films (lets not discuss Revolutions) and I enjoyed this film, it doesn't deserve to get anything less than a 4/10 for sure, but its certainly not worthy of anything over an 8/10. Is it a hollywood cash-grab using a popular ""franchise""? No I don't think it is. Is it a groundbreaking bold step into a new Matrix trilogy that fans of the original will love? No, it isnt that either, its right down the middle.I would recommend watching it, but don't go in with ultra-high expectations and dont take it too seriously and you'll have a good time.",6
3259,"Fan of the saga, many years waiting.... And now still waiting a matrix scene like 20 years ago.... This movie barelly show me a remember of the others films. Note:feminism alert...Only my wife enjoyed the movie...",4
3260,First movie the architect is prestigious and even neo at the peak of his glory couldn't touch him and now the program running the matrix the analyst is so vulnerable that even trinity can break his parts of his codes so the story is so bad with bad plot. So disappointed.,1
3261,"I get it was trying to be thought provoking about reboot culture, but wow, its a matrix film, the very least you want is kick ass action. But no, boring, repetitive, badly choreographed waste of two and a half hours.It relied on nostalgia so heavily and so blatantly it risked ruining the original film.How with 20 years of development does the original trilogy look to have more sophisticated cg and newer ideas.The matrix is supposed to be groundbreaking, this was heartbreaking.",1
3262,"What can I say? After 30 minutes I have started too realise myself this was definitely not on par with the original serie,and they were making a mess of it.The first matrix was definitely the best! The idea was so open and free,and it was a clear message who we are in the world we are living in.The idea was there, it can not be changed, and it was perfect in any way.Of course you have to build on that and in that perspective, the second and thirth movie were great jobs. Those were good movies too,and it was still in the ""real"" matrix atmosphere.With Resurrections they have ""tried"" to pick up where they left the original trilogy, but the way they have approached it, was simply very dissapointing.I even had the feeling They have implemented the current hidden political agenda (Seriously?? In a Matrix movie???)I am not saying it was a bad movie, and it had some good moments as well...But they have ""literly"" degraded the original series deep down the rabbit hole and I do not believe (if) there would be a new sequel, they could get out of it.Furthermore I would say:""I can not tell you what The Matrix Resurrections is,you've got to see it to believe it""Very dissapointing and thisone gets a 5 stars out of 10 for me...",5
3263,"Wake up and realise this movie is a dud riddled with awful dialogue, lackluster action sequences, and a story so dull you'll realise why Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss seem to be bored in every scene they're in.Or take the blue pill and be content with how little this movie has to offer other than it's sound and visuals.",2
3264,"Don't pay heed to the negetive reviews!Watch and and then decide yourself.Love love love it !!!Perfect comeback, whole movie was so I interesting and fun ! Far far better than the 3rd part ! This is the perfect ending to the series. Finally after so many years we got the best ending!",10
3265,"The scoop is simple: If you were expecting a revolutionary, exciting new sci-fi story like the very first Matrix provided, you will be disappointed and probably give it a 5 or a 6 out of 10. It's basically same old same old with some updated tech which was never really explained and a bit confusing (seems to allow them to pop into the matrix anytime/any place but not able to extract them when they are in trouble).However, if you are a long standing Matrix fan and a romantic at heart and were heartbroken when Trinity died; if you want more of the same and hope for lots of flashbacks to the series you love, If you live for the nods to your favourite moments and just genuinely love the characters and the actors that play them, you will not be disappointed and will give it a 9 or a 10.The story drags a bit and is kinda aimless in the beginning and about 3/4 through the movie I started looking at my watch because I didn't think there was enough time to actually finish the story. Also, one of the main characters speaks so quickly and softly in the first half of the movie that I could not understand what she was saying. Just kinda guessed. It gets better later or maybe I just got used to her way of speaking.I'm from the second category I described above and thoroughly enjoyed Matrix Resurrections. It wasn't one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, but it was fun and nostalgic and I was entertained. Quite a few scenes had me laughing out loud and I came out of it satisfied. Will probably go see it again just to see all the old Matrix connections again. Now, if only someone did that for Star Wars and Ben and Rey.",8
3266,"Most films are pretty easy to understand but the Matrix films are subtext layered on top of subtext. The originals were about a number of things, one of which was our reliance on machines to survive. And thus the machines were reliant on us.The new film is a less than subtle dig at social media, reboots and sequels (you don't get much more meta than a sequel that is a bit of a reboot making commentary on the current obsession with reboots &amp; sequels.)Plus the commentary on the extreme left &amp; right and cancel culture (swarm mode)If anyone doesn't like this film then they didn't get it. Later they'll have a moment of dawning realisation where they 'get it.'",9
3267,It is not often I turn off a movie halfway through.The beginning just feels like a lame parody of the original movies.Maybe they wrap it up in the second half. But I just don't care to find out.,4
3268,"Absolutely enjoyed it. Forget the negative comments and give me this movie a go... hopefully they make an another trilogy.The casting, the acting, the action scenes the dialogues and the story telling and the pace of the movie was spot on.",10
3269,"I can understand how, if all you viewed The Matrix as was just a really good action movie, then Resurrections would be a bummer. It is a movie that contains action, but it is definitely not an action movie. This is a character study, a thematic study, and a tone study of what The Matrix is, what The Matrix was, and how that fits in to our life in 2022.What I found to be the most interesting is how much clearer The Matrix Resurrections is about all of it now. Maybe I'm older and wiser, but it's easier to miss the message in the original trilogy of Matrix movies. All of its ideas about choice and transition and religion could (and for many, did) go right over your head in the face of epic highway motorcycle battles and endless tumbling shell casings. Resurrections stops letting all of that be subtext and brings it in to focus as the primary motivation for our characters.Is happiness possible in The Matrix? Is blissful ignorance really happiness? If you change the world, who is in control of that change? And did it actually change? It all comes down to a question of choice, of which the movie is explicitly clear about: is there really a choice? Or have you subconsciously decided long before the question was even asked? Where does the catalyst of choice lie?If you've got the head for it, it's wonderful. But if you were expecting another ""burly brawl"" where Neo fends off an army of agents using nothing but his super-charged martial arts, that's just not this movie.Give it some time. Let it simmer in your brain for a little while. Chew on its ideas. You'll come around.",8
3270,"Guys I'm serious - I almost called it a life and moved on. Cried myself to sleep about it. Called my family and cried more about it when I woke up. Just an absolutely befuddling mess of a movie. I watched Cats the movie just to pull me out of the dark place this horrendous poopoo movie put me in. If I had the 2+ hours of my life back, I'd rather spend it watching my ex-wife sign the divorce papers on a looping video. Thanks.",1
3271,"I've watched all movies. I had high expectations about this movie. It's just disappointing, I thought the plot was numb, tasteless. I would've thought of a plot like a journey to search for Neo, it would've been more interesting. It's confusing. What a waste. I expected more.",2
3272,"I think the original Matrix 1 was the best film hollywood has ever produced. The trilogy was good as a set, as well.But this film is beyong terrible. The cgi is very very very bad. The new ""bullet time"" is unacceptable. Even for a tv series episode, the cgi of the new bullet time is UNACCEPTABLE.This film must have been made bad on purpose. They know better. At every turn, bad decisions were made. The new morpheus SKIPS! He SKIPS!! In a yellow suit. Actual clown level set design, script, and humour. Not entertaining.This film also got entangled with naobi's hideous face.And in general, this film is edited poorly. Terrible angles, terrble cuts, the action scenes are hard to follow.... Its just a bad product. Not just for a matrix film, but by any standards.This movie is like sharknado. Thats the best comparison i can make for it.I can keep going...",1
3273,"This movie is just another cash grab.. since when is matrix a comedy movie? The cast is terrible, the story is even worst.Over 30 minutes of random flashbacks, and unnecessary conversations.This should be called how to destroy a good movie in 2hrs 28minutes and make money in the process.",1
3274,"Wow... This is every reason people didn't want studios to try and do this again. The movie even mentions a deal with Warner Bros. To keep the licenses for the material! The casting was atrocious. I love Groff in things but he was a wretched choice for Smith, same with Harris as the Analyst. They just don't work at all in those roles. Mateen II was trying something but he was NOT Morpheus. Reeves and Moss are trying but clearly limited by age when it comes to the action roles. Henwick was probably the best part of the acting circle but was somewhat minor. Even visually, there are some things that were really cool to see but then... The Matrix had this grime to it, the pressing weight of conformity. This is so bright and colorful and outrageous at points that just...None of this works. It was so bad. It gets minor points for some visuals and that's it.",2
3275,"I liked this more than I thought I would. It's has a lot of nostalgia and I liked the story. I loved the first one so much so maybe that's why I liked this as much as I did. I think it took too long to get going for my husband, but I just sat back and enjoyed the ride and had a great time watching.",9
3276,"I do not understand why so many are giving this movie a bad rep. Admittedly, it does take a beating from the absence of Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. But this movie is far from a failure.It's fun, it's dramatic, it's action packed. During these past 2 years there seems to be a theme in the film and TV industry of revisiting and honoring the past while embracing the future. This movie does so wonderfully.It also tugs at the heart strings with its referencing the original films that truly were a work of art. And the chemistry and connection between Trnity and Neo is just as powerful. It's nice to see new films will still enforce the message of love conquering all.Overall, a great film.",8
3277,"After reading all the bad reviews, I thought this was going to be a dud. To my surprise, it's really well done. If you are a fan of the concept and genre of the Matrix, then the storyline of this movie will be enjoyable.It does get a little jittery and hard to follow, but even the difficulty following the plot ends up making sense once it all unfolds. Would encourage you to watch it twice. It was even better the second time. I missed several nuances the first time around.Loved how it pays homage to the original while unlocking the opportunity for a new generation to enjoy a new series of films.",9
3278,"So bad I couldn't even sleep through it.Dookie Hoser?? Really! Come On Man!I have been waiting for this with high hopes.. I really wanted it to be epic. It was. EPIC FAIL.I will watch it again in a few days and yes Karen, I will get high first.",2
3279,"There is a scene in this film where somebody tells someone he has to make a fourth matrix film. And he goes ""feels like a cash grab""Then they talk about how wonderful Warner Bros is making this and space jam 2 fairly even in my eyes as far as studio interventions.Some questions don't need to have answers.",4
3280,"This movie is honestly a 8.5/10 in a 5/10 body. Mainly I just want to say what I think they needed to stick the landing. This is how I think it should've ended.First off, the machines senselessly recreated Agent Smith. This was their great hubris, so complete their victory over the humans they could even restore a virus that threatens them in order to keep Neo in check forever.Anyway, In the middle of the film, Agent Smith and Neo fight once more and yet again Neo wins. Agent Smith finally forgives Neo, gaining Smiths respect. So Smith decides he's going to betray the machines at the Trinity and Neo conversation. Okay but why? Well, Smith wants to control the Machine Empire for his own desires and so uses Neo and Trinity to help him do it. Can't beat him? Join him. Smith will get ultimate power controlling the machines.Earlier, there was talk of there being a way to send a Digital Intelligence into the digital Matrix Tube connected to people. This should've factored into the ending.My ending is, Neo and Trinity go to The Analyst's broken apartment and they say ""we don't need to negotiate with you, we need you to know something. You're going to live in The Matrix forever"" The Analyst laughs at the absurdity of the statement. Laughs until his mouth closes shut. The next scene shows a machine connected to a pod, then The Analysts face. Because of Agent Smiths computer virus the machines see The Analyst as Neo back in his pod. The Machine intelligence will get infected by Smiths Digital Intelligence. The Analyst will always just be a therapist in The Matrix forever.The Ending will imply Neo and Trinity are finally free to replace humanity with machines in pods, therefore when they free humans there won't always be this instant reprisal by machine armies.Yes, Machines are now going to replace people in pods. Agent Smith will make it appear they are giving power so every base is covered.Movie Two will be a heroic tale about freeing tons of people. Now the series is more free to be like a comic book movie story and bigger and badder machines can fight against the ""trinity"" of Smith, Neo and Trinity. Lets turn the tables on the machines so it frees us to learn about machine world and machine society once machines fear humans again they will give a lot more possibilities in storytelling.",5
3281,"My 10 star rating is actually for the previous MATRIX MOVIE'S... I still haven't watched M4 bcuz it's certain people that I want to watch M4 with, and those 5 people just wasn't available at the time, however it's on this weekend and then I will give my honest rating... PEACE!",10
3282,"The Matrix Resurrections is a science fiction action film produced, co-written and directed by Lana Wachowski (one of the Wachowski siblings) it's the fourth installment in The Matrix franchise with Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jada Pinkett Smith and Lambert Wilson reprising their roles from the previous films, and they are joined by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jessica Henwick, Jonathan Groff, Neil Patrick Harris and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. John Toll is joined by Daniele Massaccesi as cinematographers, the film looks amazing regarding the look and how it's shot but also the visual storytelling which the franchise is famous for. The visual effects are quite great but there are some sequences that are flawed though on the visual effects side, mostly the train action sequence but the action makes up for it. The musical score is fantastic and sounds exactly how a Matrix film should sound, both the music and sound design.The film is set sixty years after Revolutions and follows Neo, who lives a seemingly ordinary life as a video game developer troubled with distinguishing dreams from reality. A group of rebels, with the help of a programmed version of Morpheus, free Neo from a new version of the Matrix and fight a new enemy that holds Trinity captive.So we're back in the Matrix after all of these years, was it a worthy sequel? Both yes and no as it all depends on what kind of sequel you expected it would be, where the love story was a means-to-an-end afterthought in the first Matrix, the romance between Neo and Trinity are at the front of this tale, which was the right decision. It only helps the chemistry Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss share, of how they are best friends in real life. The film also brings up the themes of living in the past and the difficulties of moving forward, it's done perfectly. You'll surely enjoy the action sequences and the cast too. But the writing isn't the best nor is the story very well thought out like the two first films. But I think the film is quite underrated, I do get how it won't be for everyone, but Lana Wachowski made it feel like a love letter to the first three films and the characters. There's also a lot of world building in the film and the two first acts are actually quite great, it sadly falls a bit flat in the last act, but overall a fantastic sci-fi film and in my opinion a worthy fourth installment in The Matrix Film Franchise. I actually wanted the film to be longer than what it was, because of how much of story there was to tell. Then again, I don't think the film would work if it was longer as I wrote before, the third act was far from the same quality as the previous two acts. I think if Lana Wachowski would have taken some more time with writing the final act, making it better and less lackluster, the film would easily have been a 7 or 7.5 for me. It's a beautifully shot film with an epic musical score and entertaining action sequences but they're not as memorable as the three first films but it never strives to outdo them as it's a much more character driven story and I'm fine regarding that.Characters I really enjoyed were Jessica Henwick as Bugs and Jonathan Groff as Smith, on top of the old characters like Neo and Trinity. Though I miss Fishburne as Morpheus, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II does a great job as this alternative version of Morpheus. I think Lana Wachowski succeeded with bringing new actors into older characters and new characters all together. Regarding one of the villains, Neil Patrick Harris plays The Analyst and his character is actually quite interesting mainly because of how he's written. But I still don't understand why she didn't want Laurence Fishburne to return as Morpheus, the actor wanted to return and it would make more sense for the sake of the story for him to return. Choices like that in terms of its storytelling is a reason why this film isn't as great as it could have been. Neo and Trinity are also the reason why this sequel exists as Lana Wachowski was inspired by the loss of both of her parents and a close friend. The writing process was her way of comforting herself in the face of death. She also defines Neo and Trinity as the two most important characters in her life. I think she did a great job with these two characters for this film.",6
3283,"How? Why? Lana W has completely destroyed the franchise. Keanu.. how the ass did you let this happen?! And how the hell was Lawrence Fishburne excluded from this.. well to be fair, now having watched this train wreck, it seems more like Lawrence was spared. Seriously this movie was unimaginably awful.",1
3284,"So the premise of a new matrix being created after the last one along with the original characters being inserted, was good. The problem was a cheesy script and poorly executed action scenes. This is nothing more than Warner Brothers capitalising from the franchise and grabbing customers cash. Very bad.",2
3285,This latest release is a case study of why you dont do sequels. This came across as a desperate attempt to recapture lightning in a bottle. Very bad and so disappointed Keanu was willing to put himself in the middle of this new release.I have a movie library and naturally all the matrix movies. This one will not be added to the series. I plan to forget i saw this.Shame.,2
3286,"The original Matrix is inarguably one of the best and most influential action films of all time. It mixes action with philosophy and incredibly deep themes. It tells a story that could be read in many different ways, as an allegory for the trans experience, or as an anticapitalist metaphor. The two original sequels, Reloaded and Revolutions, double down on the more metaphysical themes of the first film, to mixed results and reception.Unfotunately, Resurrections doesn't quite live up to the legacy of the previous films. Its most glaring issue being the mediocre action. Seriously, I do not understand how one of the two Wachowskis failed to replicate the amazing choreography of the first two films, opting instead of cutting too much and using too many special effects instead of practical stunts.I did like the story though. The meta premise of the first act was very fun. The idea of Mr. Anderson being resurrected into being a video game developer as a way to suppress his memories of the first few films was clever. The way that the world around him was built to contain him is interesting, and I appreciated the effort of telling a different story through the nostalgiabait references that were interspersed. When Neo returns to the Real World, it does slow down a little bit. There is a good bit of worldbuilding concerning how things have progressed since Neo's death.Unfortuantely the third act and climax was once again lacking in several areas. The Matrix 1 has one of the best, most intense action film climaxes I've ever seen, and while the climax of Resurrections was better than the previous fights in that film, they still pale in comparison.The use of Neo's telekinetic force powers over kung fu action was disappointing. I understand that Keanu Reeves is getting older and might not be as able to do the complex kung fu choreography of the first few movies, but even so, especially considering the popularity of the John Wick franchise, I don't understand why they didn't just readjust the choreography a little to compensaite.Overall the film was alright, not the best but not the worst. I do think that it might have been better if Lilly came back to co-direct, but maybe she knew that it was a bad idea. Either way, the Wachoskis are still among my favourite directors, and I hope they return to do something better and more unique soon.",6
3287,"Okay, let me start by saying this isn't a terrible film; it was still entertaining and of it had been a stand-alone movie, my score would likely have been higher. But, it's not a stand-alone movie, it's a sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time.Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is the awarding winning designer of a videogame trilogy named ""The Matrix"". He soon faces an existential dimlema when Warner Brothers studios demand a Matrix 4, which they are going to make with or without him. To throw a spanner in the works of Thomas Anderson's repetitive life, he meets Tiffany (Carrie-Anne Moss), a woman who bears an uncanny resemblence to his videogame character Trinity. Thomas now becomes even more disilludioned with life - Is he having a psychotic episode or did his hit video game actually happen?This presmis, if done right, would have made a fair movie; Neo/Thomas trying to piece together his true identity, recovering his memories, leading to his awakening from the Matrix and setting the scene for a new triology. Instead, this concept was only partly explored and the rest of the film felt like it was trying to recreated the original triolgy into 2.5 hours feature.Whilst I empathise with Lana Wachowski's reasons for penning a new Matrix movie, it came across as self-endulgent, with a rushed screenplay and lackluster action sequences, relying too much on nostalgia for the original. That said, some of the science-fictom theories and themes were still intriguing.My biggest issue, however, was the character of Morpheus. The character played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is, in effect, an agent of the Matrix who defects. And this would have made an excellent, new character if left at that... instead we are given a Morpheus 2.0. Styalising an agent as Morpheus (and we are given a conveluted reason for this) serves no purpose to the story whatsoever and turns one of the original trilogies best charactets in to a big disappointment.If I was to make this movie, I'd share the screem time between Neo learning his true identiy and what happend to him after the events of Matrix Revolutions, and 'Morpheus 2.0' finding his place and purpose with the Matrix.In summary, an fairly entertaining movie for new comers, but a let down for the fans.",4
3288,Purest drek. Need another 150 characters. Dull as can be. Nothing happens in the first thirty minutes. Rehashes the other movies. I mean it's a movie about continuing the franchise for money and that's what they did but gosh. Made it about 30 mins.,
3289,"I was excited for this movie hoping it would somehow be as interesting and entertaining as the first movie. It was not. This movie was basically the 3 Matrix movies in one. Nothing new. Nothing mind twisting or interesting. Much of it made no sense. I am glad I watched it because I like the Matrix idea in general, but it was a major disappointment.",4
3290,"After reading the reviews I thought this movie was that bad, but I am glad I actually watched the movie; for me, it is the best movie after The Matrix (1999).",10
3291,This film always had a lot to live up to how ever story line was just very poor and the story telling just lost any soul as the film went on and really didn't do the franchise any good love the trilogy but this one can unfortunately go in the films trying to make a fast buck bin !!!!,4
3292,"There are some good elements, and some bad. I did find it worth watching, but it definitely lacked the awe and amazement I was hoping for.Bad: The effects seemed cheap comparatively. There was no character building on new characters. The plot was primarily explanations of how and why there was a 4th matrix and less about a new narrative. Lacked depth and urgency.Good: Interesting use of new actors playing old characters. Interesting take on the Neo / Trinity relationship.Really bad: The lower frame rate effect used multiple times was lame and a bit sickening.",7
3293,Everything about this film looks and feels like it was made for TV.It looked like it was fan made.The costumes and makeup were really bad.The CGI was really bad.,1
3294,"What a great job on bringing back this story! It is difficult to resurrect characters who have died in previous movies but this was well thought out.It doesn't drag on, it keeps you guessing how they are going to create the connection throughout the movie and then brings it all together all while keeping you on the edge of your seat.",10
3295,"I cant understand negative reviews really! This movie is full of nostalgia and great actions, oh god i still cant believe they actually made it.If you have a chance to watch the movie dont even think about it and just watch it.",10
3296,"When I heard a new matrix was coming out, I was excited but confused as to what in the world would be the plot since the originals came to an appropriate ending in my opinion. Resurrections was a trash movie that had so much more potential. This movie was so reminiscent of the originals that it did nothing to stand out as its own film. There were so many recycled scenes from the ogs. There were no characters that stood out and and I do not like how they killed of Lawrence fishburn's Morpheus lmao. I kept asking myself, ""what was the point in unplugging Neo if Zion perished in the first place. They gave some completely booboo explanation on Morpheus's death. There was so much going on and nothing going on at the same time..I also saw that they had several cast members of Netflix's sense 8. And the fact that trinity could fly too??? My forehead turned read because of how many times I slapped my forehead. It was anti climactic and just an all around bore. And the FIGHT SCENES LORD! Lol they were lazy and drawn out y'all.. I understand the of cast members were old but Keanu had no excuse because of John Wick. They were obviously choreographed, slow, and rushed. The writing was cringey and did no justice for any buildup scenes in the movie. They gave us nothing. They truly ruined the legacy.",4
3297,"I didn't expect such a sequel and frankly even if at times, the film may be a little long overall, I had a great time (the music is great and the action scenes are also great)",8
3298,"The first Matrix movie was lightning in a bottle. The second and third were certainly not of the same quality, but were adequate as action movies. While there are a lot of reasons for why this fourth installment is worse, I will highlight one that I personally found most noticeable.In the first three the enemies they faced felt severe and dangerous. Agent Smith, the Architect, the Merovingian...they all had a certain gravitas to them. A sense of authority and danger that made them feel lethal and powerful. But none of the enemies this movie feel dangerous, at all. There is a complete and utter lack of gravitas in all their portrayals. They don't feel intimidating or dangerous. They feel like regular people and that just isn't intimidating.",5
3299,Complete waste of time. Ruined the Martrix movies. Rather have not watched it. Got to completly blank this out. Definetly made to get cash in. Poor special effects and story. Can't believe Keanu Revees let his fans down make this. Save yourself from disappointment. Avoid at all cost!,1
3300,"I walked in expecting this movie to revolutionize everything in terms of action and CGI like The Matrix did back in 1999... that was dumb. Like, this is not a continuation of the trilogy, this is more like a vision that reflects on the hunger of wanting more of the same. It messes up with our expectations cause it knows we're walking in expecting it'll give us more of what we already have... and then it intentionally fails to deliver on any of those expectations. It doesn't give a sh**t. Deal with it. Neo and Trinity are older. They are wise old people filled with intellectual curiosities... why would they give us legendary, iconic action sequences when they already did? And as wise old people, they have landed on the conclusion that the only thing that matters in life is the personal connection between two souls. That's it. There is a lot of exposition, but it is very meta and self-referential in unexpected ways. It knows people will yearn for what they can't have as they dread to lose what they already do.",8
3301,"I was expecting to hate this movie, but it's really good. I don't get why it's getting so much hate, yes it confusing in parts but that's the Matrix, to confuse what's real to with what isn't.",9
3302,They did a great job of picking it up and incorporating the time frame since the original trilogy. Whether you love it or hate it will entirely depend on your sense of humor.If you enjoy movies/shows that make fun of themselves then you'll likely love this movie.,10
3303,This was a masterpiece! A true Matrix fan will know what is happening from being to end. Lana was magnificent at directing this great movie. I truly hope there are other Matrix films to come. Rewatch the three films prior to this one if you are confused about anything. Bravo!,10
3304,"The first matrix actually changed me, lets forget about 2 and 3. This could have been as good as the first if they gave it a chance. So soft and full of rainbows and puppy dogs, just like the minds of the crazy woke people that thought this bait and switch would not suck.",3
3305,"Beautifully convoluted nostalgia that ultimately feels more sterile than inspired. With an updated look, the matrix feels more lived in than ever. Quite enjoyable for its duration, but lacks in substance after the credits role.",6
3306,"Most negative reviewers seemed to expect some Matrix vs. Marvel extravaganza and don't seem to get what made the Matrix franchise (movies, anime, games) as a whole so special. (Not the action alone)Loved the jokes towards said viewers (Which Lana and crew were expecting), WB and remakes. That part could've been written by Kevin Smith.Also the focus on bond between Neo/Trinity makes this really work. If this becomes another trilogy I wouldn't mind.",
3307,"Ugly actresses, weak men, ultra boring dialog that never ends - what the hell is this rubbish? Hollywood has lost it.I tried to watch it - my wife fell asleep, and I just couldn't wait to leave.Neo was a moron for most of the movie and the plot is almost as dumb as the Biden administration.",1
3308,Look. Matrix was suppose to be Green. I get it. After the third movie the Matrix was rebuild but the movie is too vibrant. It doesn't feel like the Matrix. And the dialogs. Omg. Did they do that on purpose?What the 4th movie should be about is explaining how the hell Neo had super powers outside the matrix and show how the new matrix works.Maybe there could be some virus software that Neo and trinity was suppose to fix in the film. I don't know. Just saying. Anything but what I saw...,3
3309,The beginning 40mins of the movie is okay.But the rest ....... a good character such as Agent smith is just a nobody in this movie.Please dont destroy the legend Matrix.,2
3310,"Wow!! This was so bad, I had to watch it twice to be sure of how bad it was because i thought... well maybe i missed something, NOPE the movie was just awful, in no way did this remind me of The Matrix, If you thought you were going to get anything like what we got in the prior movies, think again, Neo barely did any fight scenes and when it was very geriatric and slow. This to me was more of a love story which they should have titled ""Neo and Trinity's undying love"" that would have been more accurate to what i saw, And if i even attempt to talk about Morpheus i will be typing all day. Just terrible!!. THIS IS ABOUT 2 HRS OF MY LIFE I WILL NEVER GET BACK.",2
3311,"I just watched the new movie and I LOVED IT. I know not everyone will. I think it has to do with what parts of the matrix you liked best. I think the movie did a good job in being self aware that everyone had their own opinions and feeling towards the matrix and what it meant for themThis movie felt very connected to the others. What drew me into the matrix all those years ago was the existential crisis for reality. How it played on Neo's senses and the choices he had to make.What caught me, kept me coming back again and again over the years and made matrix my favorite series were Neo and Trinity love, their all encompassing connection and this movie felt like a love letter. It was just so beautiful. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time wondering how things were going to go^^You'll have to watch and make your own conclusions but I just wanted to add my two cents and say everyone did a wonderful job on this movie. I loved Kenu Reeves and Carri-Ann Moss. The new characters were also cool. There was another reprisal I liked but &gt;&lt; no spoilers but seeing him again no matter his ""condition"" lol. Anyway to the writers you are took on an enormous undertaking and outdid yourselves.",10
3312,"I think people really have not understood that this actually is not a sequel but a parody. They even play it out in the movie - someone had a ""great"" idea and few actors from the old movie agreed to participate so that it would not be a total waste of time and money. But it is still just a good laugh towards the old movies, nothing more. If you approach like that, then it actually is not that bad. But if you think that this movie should stand up to the previous three parts, you will be disappointed.",6
3313,"WHY WHY WHY do Hollywood keep turning everything into a Feminist project ? They Bomb one after the other and they don't seem to learn the lesson that no one goes to watch a movie to see forced lines about woman oppression and woman's rights or ""woman can do it better""... Just give us a good story and good actors, stop turning everything into a political drama... This is a Feminist version of Matrix, if that's your thing then this is for you, if not then skip it and save your money.",5
3314,"Felt like a cheap copy compared to the original trilogy. It didn't feel like the matrix at all and I regret that I had to see this... slow and dull fighting, the tone is totally off (like a sitcom comedy bs) and poor Keanu seems to have resurrected as ""Gandalf the black"" from the way he moves his hands. Not a single memorable scene.",1
3315,"ALERT !!This film features people of different races, just like the original from 22 years ago, its also very woke, but not as woke as the original from 22 years ago.I do believe the word woke originated from the Matrix films, it stands for anything that opposes control. It ensembled that fascist nature of the agents against the apathetic nature of the construct.This next construct of the matrix swings more in favour of apathy, Cypher preferred a fake existence rather than a real one as long as it included all the perks of a rich wealthy person. Desire and Fear !!Within the first 10 minutes of this film I was very let down.The effects were weak and the juxtaposition while trying to be clever and self indulgent was actually annoying. The sentiment was fine but the execution was rushed and lacking.The next 80 minutes of the story/tale was excellent if you once again ignore the annoying flashbacks, the film improves ten foldMajor studios will always think their audiences are stupid.....Somehow the film managed to verbally annihilate ( directly ) the major studio that funded the production.The inside joke, while I understood the need for this was incredibly jarring and parody worthy.Luckily it all occurs within the first 10-15 mins, a mumbo jumbo version of millennials being stereotypical millennial. I hate thatIt was an awful start to this film in every way, cheap, lazy, self indulgent and nearing a parody, that I almost stopped watching !!Luckily the film found its feet and the story and ideology beyond the opening was brilliant.My only criticisms is it tries to be apologetic for being woke, its incredibly multi racial but annoyingly not woke enough.The Matrix started the ideology of being woke, it was related to genius, mindfulness, fairness, freedom, equality e.t.cI hate religion but these ideologies ill always stand by and approve of.This film is however slightly wishy washy about its ideals, the parody side of this shines through to bright.It then begs the question, Remake, Reboot, Dejavu, ParodyIt then begs the question, Remake, Reboot, Dejavu, ParodyIt then begs the question, Remake, Reboot, Dejavu, ParodyIt then begs the question, Remake, Reboot, Dejavu, ParodyBy the end your just hoping its not Dejavu.",7
3316,"I think that this movie was a well planned joke by Lana Wachowski and it is clearly a huge middle finger to whoever was expecting another masterpiece; this is obvious by some dialogue lines. For the whole time it was clear that the director never intended to make a serious movie, but a parody disguised as a Hollywood blockbuster. The Wachowski can live off their fame for the rest of their life, they made one of the most influential productions in cinema history and they are in the position to do whatever they want with their creation. I have nothing but praise for what they have done and I am genuinely laughing at all the negative comments and reviews written by people that clearly did not understand what the purpose of this film was.Characters are parodistic, Keanu Reeves looked more like John Wick, than Neo. Morpheus was clearly the junk version of Laurence Fishburne and the actor was fully aware of the role that he was playing. Jonathan Groff played the funny version of Smith. Neil Patrick Harris as The Analyst was joking about one of the most famous elements of the entire franchise: the Bullet Time. Special effects and CGI are simply amazing, but with a budget of 190 millions dollars I was not expecting otherwise. In a way the Wachowskis made history again: they've convinced Warner Bros. To invest in a very expensive parody of The Matrix, with a plot that does not make any sense. There is no better way to end this year and I am so happy that this is my very last 2021 IMDb review.",6
3317,"I am reporting my first impressions on this hugely anticipated sequel to the original trilogy, the first of which was - and ever will be - one of the most influential science fiction movies in the history of filmmaking.The original, 'The Matrix', defined how we should see action sequences in the digital age, bringing on countless of scenes with jaw-dropping, never seen before spectacles. Far more than that, the story was unique and captivating, full of thought. The monologue of agent Smith, while interrogating Morpheus, is one of the best written chain of ideas I have ever encountered in my life. I knew instantly back then, that it was going to be a classic for generations to come.This one starts out bad, copying the original again and again for almost half of its running, which is not cool. Far from it. Highlighting from the original says nothing to the millennials, who have never seen the original movie. It says something for us, old farts, but even for us it is tiring and 'seen it before'. However, intellectually, the story comes to life midway through the film and from then on it is quite good.I'd like to mention some actors who made strong impression on me: Jessica Henwick was superb. Simple, I liked her instantly. Neil Patrick Harris, wow, man, I hated him straight away. Fantastic supervillain. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II a bit overacted. Less would have been more for him.All in all, it started bad but then turned out to be acceptable.",6
3318,Brings back old memories. Good to watch and not boring. It was a good attempt to create a sequel and it's always hard to create sequel to a legendary movie like matrix. There's a very high expectation and very hard to keep up. It'll just remind you of when you were a kid and bring back the memories.,7
3319,"The Wachowskis wanted nothing to do with this project and it's clear to see why. Unfortunately they were forced into it and you can see the stabs they take at Warner Bros in the movie itself. I love the original trilogy and it did not need a reboot. It was fun to see Neo and Trinity in the matrix again, especially with the new technology in film. But overall the movie is boring and doesn't explore anything new. Trinity only truly becomes Trinity one hour and fifty-something minutes into the movie. I fell asleep! I'm sorry that this movie happened.",4
3320,"A really great sequel, and for true fans of the first film, it's a lovely and original movie that seemingly annoyed the right people, especially given the ungodly amount of bot ratings and trolling. A unique and brilliant way to reintroduce the characters while creating a few cool set pieces along the way, terrific movie.",10
3321,"If like me you love film, cinematography, creativity and The Matrix.... Do not watch this film.The original Matrix was a masterpiece of originality and art, this is about as artistic as chewing gum on the pavement. A complete waste of 2 and half hours.",1
3322,"Perhaps it was too much to ask that a much delayed sequel would have the same emotional impact as the originals. This movie left me wishing they had just left the franchise alone. The few interesting bits were too short and not covered in enough depth, and the boring bits (pretty much every fight scene) were far too long and numerous.To be fair, the acting was pretty good, so that was not the issue. It was just that the plot was poor, and it felt more like one of those Youtube videos where they ""explain xxxxxxxxxx in 10 minutes"" . . . Just spread over two hours instead.I felt like they actually bottled it . . . They could have taken the story into some interesting places which the ideas they did introduce, but they just focussed on (re)creating ever more nonsensical fight scenes, which have been done often and better since the original movies created a whole new concept.Very disappointed and actually quite tired by the end.",5
3323,"Ending was fine without this movie mixing it all up. Story line turns to crap. Not sure if Neo or Trinitu or Smith is The One anymore. Has a middle age cast looks off in this movie. The young actors are boring and forgettable. They look like gender studies graduates that were put in a movie based on looks and not talent. And Jada Smith plays a bigger role, so I think that says it all about this movie. All in all not a needed movie. Forget you even say this if you can.",5
3324,Okay so I'll say that I was very blessed this month as a movie goer first Spider-Man now this its truly been a good month for action fans and this most definitely is a amazing movie with heart pounding action. Just like Spiderman is this is most definitely a great treat for any true matrix fan and believe me when I say you won't be disappointed.,9
3325,"What happened? Once the opening dialogue began, my heart sank. And then when the big hulking agent appeared with that over-emphasized scowl, I knew Resurrections was going to be a huge disappointment. It was like the last installment of Pirates of the Caribbean: Everything familiar mixed together with a giant slab of liver and raw sewage.:(",2
3326,"A sequel that raises the expectation of fans Keep in mind that there will be a fresh story going in a new direction. But it turned out to be a scam selling antiques. The handle dyed the cat to make it look like new. It was disappointing in every way compared to the old trilogy. Until it seems like a bigotry to create a sequel, sticking to the return of Keanu Reeves only for fans who will still go to see anyway. Just don't expect to be disappointed.",6
3327,"I grew up on the original 3 Matrix movie. The first 3 were so innovative, so revolutionary. The style as much as anything was brilliant.This was pile of garbage. Nothing was good about it, it destroyed the franchise, and any hope for a real reboot. It was a foolish joke of a movie.Acting F- (Besides Keanu)Storyline F------------- (Didn't exist.)Visual Effects F ---- (You could see the green screen often.)Plot + Story F ---- (None)Production F- (WTF)What the hell did I just watch. The jokes all fell short, and were at the worst times. Half the film was recapping the old Matrix. The actors couldn't act, the story line didn't exist. They didn't take this seriously at all. It was like a documentary gone bad.The worst film possibly ever created. Like ever.",1
3328,"This movie seems to have been made just for the sake of it. Most of it is spent reliving past glories and piggybacking of the success of the original trilogy through flashbacks and refrences. Speaking of original, this movie has nothing new to offer.It seems that being written by a woman this time around has ruined what the matrix was originally about. We certainly don't want to see love and relationships conquering all.Big fan of the First 3 movies. This one not so much.",3
3329,"Im sitting in a half empty cinema watching ""Matrix 4"" and im so bored that i decided to write a review. Dont believe the propaganda, this is bollywood scale mega s**t. I have one BIG philosophical conclusion though, not worth of a 3$ ticket and two hours of my life but still a conclusion. Talent fades, as everything else, its kinda sad. Dont watch this amateurish bull crap better just take a nap or wash your dishes.",1
3330,"If it wasn't for the special effects, this movie would be 4 stars. It had such an easy platform for creating something cool and it failed. The story is confusing and hard to follow and the acting was weak. If I had to rank the series, it's #1, #2, #3, then #4. Yeah, the worst of the bunch.",6
3331,"It's a bit too long. It's a bit boring in places, especially at the beginning. The 'Matrix as a video game' plot is a little Oceans 12. It's misses the original agent Smith. There's no wowee scene as such, some good ones but no bullet time from the first or motorway chase from the second movie.In truth, I quite liked it, but not as much as first 2 movies but it better than the 3rd.",6
3332,"If we are in Matrix, I'd like today erased from it. I'd like to wake up in the morning where this movie was never released. There are not enough word to describe my disappointment.To those who are suffering as much as i do; go watch first Matrix movie. It helps with the pain.",4
3333,"As a fan of original movie &amp; M. Reloaded, I had very low expectations for this movie. Because the third one -Revolutions - was horrible and I tried to forget it as soon as I've watched it back in '03. So I was expecting another Revolutions here.Nevertheless, this one exceeded my expectations. I understand the lower ratings are from high expectations and higher ratings like mine are coming from low expectations.Having said that, this movie has a very big problem as casting. I don't mean the actors are necessarily bad but especially Morpheus &amp; Analyst are very bad choices - not remotely suitable. But the real disaster is Agent Smith. Ok, nobody can come close to Hugo, but this was a very pale, very uneffective and terrible Agent Smith.Overall, this movie was better than I feared, but casting was unexpectedly horrible. Let's say Analyst's cat was better than most of the characters in the movie!",6
3334,"The best I can say about this movie is meh. It wasn't awful, it wasn't great. It just....was. The story, in concept, was an interesting idea but the execution was bland. The action, which had been a hallmark of the series, was dull. There was only one scene where I thought, ""that was cool"".The new actors were...fine. The new characters, with the notable exception of Bugs, were fine. Bugs was great. Good character, great acting, and a valid reason to be. I doubt I'll watch it again. Even Revolutions and Revelations which suffer from Watchowski-itis(long drawn out, boring, overly philosphised, high minded, self indulgent dialogue) at least had exciting action to make them rewatchable. This one just doesn't. It's like a bland Marvel version of the Matrix.Still Patrick-Harris was great, as always, and Reeves and Moss were great on screen again.But this movie is just a dud. So much wasted potential.",4
3335,"This review contains a minor spoiler that does not reveal any major plot points.The first big action scene in this movie, brings back the good old Smith gang. In this day and age, it is too obvious how wildly off target everybody is when firing their guns. It was a bad sign that this movie was not going to contribute to the franchise. A lot of this felt like Terminator: Genesys. There was a mix of new characters and old characters. A rehash of many of the staples that made the previous movie such a good film. In this case, there was the whole bullet effect shot. There is a callback to that in this film. In fact the entire opening of the first film is recreated in this film.Also like the bad Terminator sequel, it felt like they threw in the movie as many ideas as possible. (What if Neo forgot how to fly, kind of a Peter Pan thing?). The first half of the film explores the idea of Thomas Anderson still being a computer programmer and Neo actually being a fictional character in a video game called the Matrix. Enter the new kids from the 'real world' to wake him up (again). There is a lot of on-the-nose callbacks to the original film, making deliberate comparisons of new characters to old characters. For instance, there is the partner at the gaming company that resembles Mr. Smith, repeating some of the exact lines. There is the 'new' Morpheus that is there to give Keanu the red and blue pill choice, again. There was a question that still has not really been answered as to why Laurence Fishburne wasn't asked back along with the rest of the gang. Personal vendetta? Asked for too much money? Discrimination against age? I think it is the latter, wanting a younger and more nimble Morpheus for the fight scenes. Ultimately I think the morphed reincarnation of Morpheus was not handled well.The second half of the movie is where the studio checklist takes over. I agree with others that the fight scenes are not as good as the original movie, along with the visceral fight scenes we are used to in the better blockbuster movies out there. Including the John Wick series (what gives?) There is also one particular moment of horror that I thought went too far and was in poor taste.MINOR SPOILEROur protagonists are chased by other people (yes we are supposed to understand they are really programs but they are still perceived as real people). The ""Smiths"" invade their programming and have them jump toward their deaths (trying to land on our heroes). The sights and especially sounds of the bodies crashing into cars and smacking on pavement was too real. The sequence went on for several seconds. I had to look away in shock of the realism of the bodies smashing with such violence. I realise it was supposed to be a ripoff of ""World War Z"", but even that movie didn't force me to watch unpleasant reminders of 9/11.END MINOR SPOILERYou also get the obligatory CGI of the machines. I enjoy the performances of some side characters, and the idea of a Psychoanalyst as the Architect. In general, the only original aspect of this revisit of the first movie is the idea of Keanu hallucinating that he is in the Matrix, and successfully messing with the audience's mind about what is really up with the Thomas Anderson character. But then it fails to be clever and provides more fan service than I care for (including playing actual clips of the first movie throughout). The movie then goes through the checklist of scenes that you see in every action movie. Including going into extra innings where the audience was ready to wrap things up 20 minutes ago. Since it is available for streaming, you don't have to wait for the DVD. Otherwise, wait to rent it on whatever platform is convenient. The movie was shot on video (which was obvious in some places), so I didn't see much advantage to seeing it on the big screen.",6
3336,"... not that bad as i was expecting but not that good either, basically a love story, missing the philosophical posits of the first film that made it so great, i supose you could argue it questions the ideas of naratives and grand naratives.. but really clutching at straws for that, worth a watch, but dont expect to much.",6
3337,"Only gave it 5 stars out of respect for how great Keanu Reeves is as an actor and in real life. The first hour is boring. If you must watch this movie, just skip the first hour.",5
3338,"Firstly, this movie is no way worthy of some of the bad reviews... admittedly, they are reviving a story that had wrapped up, but there are some elements of that, that are genius.Taking the factual memories of Neo and turning them into believed fiction via a computer game designer is class! And the touch of nostalgia with the old footage is very clever.I enjoy how they bring Morpheus back despite the real world being +60 years from the end of the last movie is clever.I honestly think the people giving a low rating are those people that didn't really understand the original fully.This film captures good visuals, kung fu, car chases, philosophy and it's centred about the love of Neo &amp; Trinity.... What more could you want in a Matrix movie?",8
3339,"This movie is just about the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Anything incredible accomplished in the original was mutilated by this one.The acting is bad. The script is bad. The concept is bad. The flow is bad.20 minutes in I really couldn't care what happened. What could have been a cool edition to the series failed at everything it tried to do.The flash backs were over used. They added new characters that you don't end up caring about. For some reason (never really explained) Neo loses most of his abilities and Trinity gets them of course its a lame attempt at ""girl power.""The most baffling thing is how so many people have written positive reviews for this movie. It's clearly a money grab that it worth the money or time spent watching it.",1
3340,"The Matrix 4 leans heavily into the meta. Some parts of the film feel like a documentary of the brainstorming process they went through in trying to come up with a concept for another story. From what I can tell, the film seems to agree with itself that it's a superfluous addition to the franchise. It's kind of entertaining and I have to at least give it kudos for self-awareness. But the only purpose of it all is (somehow still) to set the stage for action sequences to come. There's also some social commentary in there about fake news etc. The new villain's trumpesque motto is something along the lines of 'people can't resist when they don't know what's real'. There's also a softer outlook on the 'threat' of AI. Perhaps we can peacefully coexist with sentient machines, after all? It's a fair effort to update the themes of the story to make it relevant in the 2020's. The problem still remains though, that The Matrix franchise has gone as far as it can in terms of action sequences (as well as the whole movie industry). Making a worthy sequel to the first film might always have been to do something different entirely. For a brief moment, I felt they were maybe on to something here. In the first act we're not entirely sure whether the whole Matrix thing actually happened, and a part of me wished the film would stay there. I'd gladly watch a whole film where Keanu Reeves tries to muster up the courage to speak to Carrie-Anne Moss in a coffee shop while simultaneously wondering whether he's psychotic or not. Surely the (real) legacy of the first Matrix film was that of giving us something we didn't know we wanted... not gunfights in slow motion wearing leather trench coats? I didn't need more of that, anyway.",6
3341,"This movie exceeded expectations and felt like the true sequel to the original. The fight scenes and action are not important to me, but the philosophical aspects which interest me have all the boxes ticked. INFJs and other Ni/Se users will love this movie and sensor types will hate on it for not making the connections to biblical mythology. Worth watching twice with an elevated consciousness.",10
3342,"It's the worst movie I have ever watched, wasn't expecting it to be as good as the originals but this was on another level of garbage, they managed to make the action scenes boring somehow. The plot was stupid, the re use of scenes from the old movies was way overdone, The way they introduced old characters was terrible, casting was aweful, plot was aweful, ending was aweful, everything about this movie just sucked. It almost seemed like the movie was some sort of joke/parody at first but no it's an actual movie, if you can even call it a movie. Hated it.",1
3343,"I was expecting this to be terrible considering the low ratings and bad reviews, but I thought it was a bit above average. I thought the plot was okay, however it at times it was kind of hard to understand story due to the complexity and the terminology that was used. Plus it didn't help that I didn't remember most of what happened in the trilogy as I last watched it years ago. I don't know why, but I didn't really like the characters that were helping Neo. I thought the action scenes were good and it definitely made the movie more interesting. I would've liked if the plot was different and it wasn't focused on saving Trinity as I wanted to see more of Neo and Trinity together.",6
3344,"Too fast cuts, bad soundtrack, too much gunfire, bad villain character. No matrix feeling. But it's entertainment if you don't know the old movies. So unfortunately I have to give 4 stars.",5
3345,"This was awful. The first film was perfect. I hated the next 2. This seemed like an attempt to undo the damage of the 2nd and 3rd movies but dug the hole even deeper. Too many cartoon characters. Morphious and Agent Smith were iconic roles in first movie, new versions tried to be cool and failed. Lots of flashbacks trying to make us think it's good like the original. Attempts at comedy that have no place in the franchise. Hopefully they just let the franchise stop now.",3
3346,"Smith: Our beloved parent company, Warner Brothers, has decided to make a sequel to the trilogy.Neo: What?Smith: They informed me they're gonna do it with or without us.Neo: I thought they couldn't do that?Smith: Oh, they can. And they made it clear they'll kill our contract if we don't cooperate.Neo: Really?",1
3347,"I am a big fan of the first 3 movies wich I enjoyed very much but this is purely garbage compared to the other 3. Nothing was good about this ""movie"". Maybe the ""what's up doc"" joke but that is IT.",1
3348,It is a greatly written movie. Creativity and originality at its best! However action scenes are way below the trilogy and soundtrack is.... Just terrible. The Matrix trilogy was great because of its milestone action scenes and its philosophy. This one lacks the first one. Boring action scenes but great story. 7/10.,7
3349,"The matrix is my favorite movie of all time.... That being said please don't waste your money and more importantly time watching this. Its actually upsetting that Hollywood is still getting away with ruining classics, this movie being a perfect example.",2
3350,"The first half is almost pure reminiscence. Sure there are some pretty lights to look at, but it follows too closely to the original material to get emotionally involved. Just like the cats name, it feels like Deja vu instead of fresh and exciting. Full of content but lacks in introducing the characters and then developing them.There is some interesting and unique action scenes, especially towards the end, as our heroes remind themselves of their place among the chaos. Some of the links are not well explained and convoluted, but at other times the dialog shows hints of something deeper and more profound. Almost as if the writing team were not quite on the same page, so they crammed as many of the ideas in as possible. Some hit their mark while others were lost amongst the quickly chopped scenes.All in all there were some decent performances, good CGI. But much throw away dialog and not enough to make you feel for the characters. Hardcore Matrix fans will be disappointed; but never the less Resurrections is a flashy futuristic romp for the casually interested which could lead to some more interesting material in our cinemas if they decide to further pursuit the reboot.7/10.",7
3351,"I'll say this, it wasn't as terrible as what seems like most people who've left reviews would have you believe. As a fan of the original trilogy, I will say that there were some elements here that didn't call for this 4th film. I mean, yes, the special effects were crazy good (there's one set piece in particular that had me glued to the screen), but I found it confusing to follow the plot. I guess popcorn flicks don't necessarily need one in this day and age. I did like the nostalgia factor and I found myself entertained just enough to make it to the end.Good for a one-time watch at the very least.",6
3352,"No, this was not... no... this didn't happen.No...The movie starts duller than the backside of a sharp axe. You expect it to turn, but it never does!They've had 19 years, surely this movie is going to be about more than a few people having a middle age crisis...A unimpressive movie. 19 years later and you'd think surely at least they'd outdo their fights, but nope. Not even any impressive fight scenes. Sure some people throwing punches and shooting guns, but, compared to the earlier movies, this was a can of rotten tamatas!They didn't outdo their earlier movies in any aspect, and the ending...Are they trying to milk this? Make a bunch of rotten movies? Cuz that's what it looks like, and even that is a bad attempt.This was so bad, I've lost all motivation to even criticize the abomination!",6
3353,"The original trilogy was a masterclass in cinematography, with brilliant script and characters. This was the biggest let down movie of the year.... Like a Power Rangers B movie. I'm generally inclined to like most keanu films, but not even him and Carrie could save this shambles. The CGI was horrible, including all the hard to see boring fight sequences. The new characters were exceptionally unmemorable, and Morpheus .....why ? Laurence Fishburne is the only one for this. Shameless cash cow reboot. The reason I care enough to write how poor this was, is because the originals were so good and falls so short of that.",3
3354,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it felt forced. The director and studio should have scrapped 50% of the footage and refilmed it after Covid was over. Half of the story like was childish and dull. The other half of the movie was pretty good if not great. After it was over I said to my wife, so this is what bipolar schizophrenia is like!It almost makes me not want to watch the 4th John Wick when it's released.",5
3355,"Every idiot today wants to be ""PC"" and say only a thing is good when everyone else say it's good and never have an opinion of anything unless everyone in mass agree with it. This movie clearly steers clear of that and just made a movie that's an ACTUAL continuation of the original trilogy and of course everyone hates it. How of these so called movie enthusiasts even understood the original trilogy,I have no idea.But all I see is, two movies came out at the same time -The Matrix Resurrections and Spiderman No way Home. One was praised as glorious in every way while all it did was crossed check marks and had not an ounce of story while the other truly had a deep evolution and obviously was cussed and thrown out as garbage. It's obvious which is which.In short, this movie is PERFECT, Period and anyone who says otherwise can fornicate themselves and to ones who don't agree and have an opinion EVEN on this review can fornicate their blood relatives, especially the one gave birth to them.",10
3356,"I absolutely loved the trilogy. To me it's among best metaphors human beings have EVER come up with to attempt to explain to others *the nature of consciousness*. People who already experienced what ""it"" is were given a common language to talk about it. The trilogy as a whole is an incredibly enlightening piece of art. Add to that the iconic and groundbreaking action scenes, deep philosophical concepts, experience reports from journeys through the wonderland of consciousness, the unique underground style, the fact that every word and every breath in between was on purpose, the fact that every single shot looked like a comic strip or a flawless piece of art. Et cetera et cetera.Forward 20 years and enter the Matrix Resurrections. A movie nobody asked for. Conscious observers see why the devil's called a bringer of light. They say you get insight, power, status, freedom and control in exchange for your soul. But it's a bad deal. Lana Wachowski's content quality is declining with everything she puts out. Matrix Resurrections is soulless and has no backbone. It feels like everything that made the old movies iconic and amazing is either mocked or changed for the worse.The characters in this movie, especially ""Smith"" and ""Morpheus"" think they are so much cooler than they actually are while back in the original trilogy characters didn't try to be cool and that's what made them a hundred times cooler than these clowns. The stoicism of the main characters in the old Matrix also added to the unique iconic style that made the franchise feel so special but Lana Wachowski seems to have forgotten what made the movies good. The action scenes in this movie are mostly terrible. ""Smith"" punches like a girl and you can't be sure if he's Neo's antithesis or an H&amp;M model. Morpheus wearing flamboyant clothes and jumping around with a martini glass while making fun of the original Morpheus was also a very questionable move on the directors part. Neo's new shock wave looks like it was inspired by one of the most boring Dragon Ball moves ever and as I read so eloquently formulated somewhere else, Neo went from ""alpha and omega"" to simping beta. The love story of Neo and Trinity was cool, they were chill, they just liked each other. In this movie is a total simp for Trinity.The meta commentary is kind of OK in the beginning, sometimes even clever but it should've stopped right then and there. When the analyst used the term ""bullet time"" to describe Neo's matrix-breaking speed I almost wanted to throw up. I wouldn't even have minded the occasional feminist remark or people drinking coffee all the time if at least other parts of the movie were good but unfortunately they weren't.I have already watched the movie multiple times, probably more times than it deserved but I wanted to find something I liked about it. The first 10 minutes or so are genuinely interesting and at least feel a little Matrix-ish. There are some interesting ideas that pop up throughout the movie but nothing really groundbreaking. Sati and Bugs are hot. I think that's everything positive I can say about the movie.4/10 stars for creativity, for effort and for it being at least officially a Matrix movie.",4
3357,The fashion was like high end Hot Topic and the acting was weird in the beginning but made sense when Neo and Trinity came to realize who they really are. Special effects where great and the psychiatrist glues the whole convoluted story together.,8
3358,"New depths of the Matrix, if you love the lore and want to see where the matrix universe can be expanded this is the movie for you. I really loved this movie and feel as though I must have seen a different movie than other people. I love the intrigue, the suspense, the romance, etc. This is the perfect sequel in my opinion. I loved the world created and can't wait to see what else comes from it.",10
3359,"Matrix leftovers served cold. Worse than any sequel in recent history including Keanu's former bench mark set in SPEED 2, HOME ALONE 2 or what Disney did to STAR WARS. Only watch if you want to see how long you can endure a prolonged state of cringe.",3
3360,"Carrie Ann and Keanu are the only good thing about this movie. You cannot make Laurence Fishburne from nothing, this movie is a desperate attempt and it fails. The only reason I'm watching this is because there is nothing else on!!!",2
3361,"Lana Wachowski is a genius.Reset your brain. Reset your expectation. And please let the crew do the magic.Whatever you had watched on Matrix series. They do everything x 50 in this movie.CGI, Fiction, Acting, Action Scenes.Just enjoy the movie. Again, please reset your expectation.Thank you Lana.",10
3362,"Jonathan Groff as Smith was genius. He rocks the role and I would like to see him in more action films. Great nostalgia and the effects are good (not breaking any ground but hard to do nowadays).The story, however, is simple, not exciting and has too many unnecessary convolutions. As others have called it, the film doesn't really contribute much in terms of an interesting continuation.Glad I saw it but won't see again.",7
3363,"I understood why there were less ratings. You will definitely enjoy only keeping in mind you don't put expectations as of originals and compare to them. Keep it separate and standalone movie Knowing the stories of prequel helps. Great comeback after a long time carrying the same spirit as original. Plus point is the story itself and the way it progresses, scenes explained well with sci-fi touches and concludes. Neo and trinity done the magic again. I want this franchise to come up with more movies.",9
3364,"The action scenes are really worse without Yuen Wo-ping. But the philosophical significance is consistent with the previous trilogy. People always resist oppression. A man who loves freedom must free himself from bondage.Machines are dictatorships, like ccp, Xitler, Kim Jong-un and so on. People need fighters like Neo and Trinity. At the same time, enlightenment always makes sense. Otherwise people will be manipulated by machines, like sheep or Tiffany who is the mother that was kidnapped by machines with her child.",8
3365,"This movie is like what Indiana Jones 4 is to its original trilogy - very mediocre and clearly made just to make money by banking on the success of the first three movies. The first 3 Matrix movies I thought were great. The original Matrix from 1999 is awesome. The second and third, in my opinion, were good but not great. This fourth one is the worst of the sequels by a mile! It can't even be compared to the first three. The story is not only stupid, but there's plot holes and some things that just don't make any sense. It adds nothing of substance to the Matrix storyline and completely fails to capture the magic of the first three Matrix films. To top it off, it was also quite boring. I could have walked out halfway through the movie and not cared about how it ends, which is really saying something.",3
3366,"A realy funny idea for the first 30 minutes turns out in a pretty avarage resurrection Story, that feels contstracted just to make a sequel. Not so innovativ like in the 90ies. After Inception and this years Tenet you have to do more than just fan-service to bring a complex story.",6
3367,"The movie was very bad, it does not deserve to be watched. There is nothing new and not the old idea. Green photography. The special power of the hero. The excellent city of Zion, which has a strange color. Moving to the matrix. Changing actors in a very, very bad way. How does he die and someone else becomes his replacement?",3
3368,"Im a huge fan of the trilogy. The intellectuality of it, but also the chemistry between Neo and Trinity. I was bummed when it ended how it did. But I never expected another movie.I went into this completely unspoiled with no expectations. Didn't read any theories. Nothing. I'm so glad I didn't because I was able to enjoy it for exactly what it was. Which ended up being what I wanted all along: Neo and Trinity back together. Even better, alive! All is well that ends well.Very grateful to Lana Wachowski for giving me this closure of happily ever after.No complaints here. If anything, it makes me love the movies more.",10
3369,"Watched the original movie once in 1999 and all I remembered was alot if men in orchestrated slapping scenes.I watched 2 and 3 at the cinema in what seems a lifetime ago and remember saying they wasn't great.So into the forth movie and I literally couldn't remember the plot or what the matrix even was and this strategy back fired and then some.So, I ended up watching a series of events on screen that I just couldn't fathom, nothing made any sense to me and I didn't know what anyone was talking about most of the time.In summary, much psyco babble tripe. Good looking movie but ultimately wtf just happened.Closing; i text my mate after ""did you enjoy the 4th matrix"" he replied ""that was the second one wasn't it"". It's fair to say we are not matrix biggest fans, make sure you watch the boxset before you go if your a casual like us.",4
3370,"I just don't have the strength to say how disappointed I am with with what was made in this sequel. Just don't see it, it's gonna taint the any good memory about the matrix.",3
3371,As a huge matrix fan and someone who has thought about it for literal decades I loved what they did with this one. It was everything I wanted out of this sequel and I'm very glad it was made.,10
3372,"It's labelled as an action/sci-fi movie. The original matrix was. This one probably still is. But it impacts you in a different way the original did.The two main characters are older now, and they are not the same as they once were. They were dead and were resurrected...even that made me wonder about the symbolism behind it. The movie was more relatable and profound than you'd think, but may take a few watch for the story to fully sink in.",10
3373,"As far as sci fi goes the Matrix films have always been some of my favorites. I loved seeing the characters return, the new characters also, and the acting was genuine. I liked the girl power, Trinity is a beautiful badass character. Not sure who was in need of money or if this was a poor attempt to defibrillate Hollywoods heart but the story line was very weak. Hollywood, lately, has been taking advantage of fan loyalty and producing shiny, glittery poorly written thrown together films based on beloved franchises, i.e. Star Wars. Please stop this Hollywood. The Matrix franchise went from an Architect to an Analyst, they outsourced the matrix to India, no offense to India.",5
3374,"Matrix 4: Ressurections.(Possible spoilers)Firstly, I enjoyed it and it's a better film than the 3rd film.Few gripes an observations. 😉For me it lacked any big 'wow factor' or stand out scenes though that made you say ""whoa"" (pun intended). 😬The ending was the most impressive (as expected) with some good action.Constant flashback clips only managed to highlight how superior the moments from the first films were.Characters weren't that likeable or failed to have enough time for us to attach to so it was difficult to be concerned for them when they were in any supposed peril. 🙄The fights didn't feel very well choreographed either, even restrained almost. (I guess we have been spoilt in the years since the Trilogy by John Wick and The Raid level fight scenes.) Not much crazy wire work movements or mind blowing bullet time action. Was it a much lower budget?It contained a million easter eggs that I'm sure an equal amount of youtube videos will dissect ad nauseam.I missed the real Morpheus and the 'new guy' wasn't even close to the acting skills of Fishburne, (in fact he was a bit cocky imo)Hugo Weaving's presence was also greatly missed as his replacement lacked any menace at all.Same with main villain who became almost a cliche Bond baddie the further the film progressed.(complete with cat) 🤣Script was the usual mind bending rehash of the original with a few nice touches but mostly felt like a parody of itself (intentional maybe?). A lot less religious mumbo jumbo as well which was nice. (or at least I didn't really notice if it was.)Thankfully it wasn't as unnecessarily 'woke' as expected it to be also.Good diverse cast of unknowns enthusiastically giving their all. Christina Ricci's (albeit brief) appearance was most welcome. 😉Jada Pinkett almost unrecognisable and a bit irritating.Not surprisingly it was left wide open for another film. 🤔Hopefully there will be an extended version released .It's worth a watch for sure, a far better Superhero Sci-fi film than the recent few imo. (Dune was great though)I'd like to see Neo and Trinity using their powers in next film from the start.Will be adding it to the collection when released. 👍🏻7/10A fun, nostalgic return to the Matrix universe, long overdue for some but it possibly benefitted from the distance.""I still know Kung fu!""😬👍🏻Keanu for President.",7
3375,"When I first heard about this movie , I was not excited. I remembered the first two sequels being less than stellar.Still, I wanted to give it a shot, watching it on HBO Max rather than take the extra time and money to go to a theater.While I had low expectations going into it, I really should have had lower expectations.It was not without its good parts. There were stunning visuals, the initial fourth wall-breaking tone was interesting, and I felt some feelings when seeing Trinity and Neo back together again.It was also interesting to see how humans and machines were starting to work together more and some of the other technology changes that had occurred since Matrix: Revolutions.However, the film was confusing, even by Matrix standards. It failed to let various revelations breathe and gel before moving on to the next thing.The fight scenes, while sometimes cool, were lacking and look very poor compared to the first Matrix film.There were no compelling villains. The ""bots"" were inferior replacements for the agents of the first film. At one point, The Analyst had a cool time-stopping power, but it was quickly and inexplicably undermined.The flashbacks to the earlier films felt lazy and forced, while the newly added protagonists were mostly forgettable.After viewing it, this movie felt more like a first draft to a much better film. A few more rewrites, better plot focus, better explanation on the revelations, and way better villains were all needed.Next time, take the blue pill.",4
3376,"I haven't really written actual spoilers but I do reveal enough about the movie, so if you like to avoid trailers like me, so that it's all a surprise, don't read this yet.It was never going to be easy. The Matrix isn't just a great movie. It's my number one film of all time. I lost count of how many times I watched it and I still enjoyed every minute of it. I am not a script writer but I can imagine that it's not easy to recreate such a masterpiece.Nonetheless I thought The Matrix Reloaded was awesome. I have read many fans saying that it wasn't good enough, but I respectfully disagree. It cannot be compared to the first one, but if they were going to make a sequel showing Neo after he discovered his ""inner power"", that was the way to do it. Mind blowing action with extended fight scenes and an enjoyable original story that let us know a bit more about the matrix.Then came Matrix Revolutions. This one was a disappointment for me but at least it added another angle to the story and explored the world of Zion and the machines, which were sort of backstage on the previous ones. And it provided a decent, albeit bittersweet conclusion to the trilogy.With this in mind, I was looking forward to Matrix Resurrections. I had no idea what they would come up with, but given that the revolutions story didn't make much sense to be repeated, I imagined or hoped for something in the same vein as Reloaded. Not at all!The whole thing felt like a mix of a parody and remake of the original Matrix movie, and I don't know why they went as far as showing footage from it as flashbacks. Morpheus is some dude that just doesn't carry the same wise Kung Fu master persona. Neo was weak and confused pretty much the whole time. There was no matrix ""feel"" at all. And I don't get why they made Niobe look so much older, hasn't it been twenty years for everyone? The Merovingian, another fine character ruined.I did like the new female character, Bugs. What I didn't like is what they did to give a female character so much power in contrast with Neo. I always like seeing women kicking ass, like in Underworld, Kill Bill or Resident Evil. What I don't enjoy so much is when they change existing characters to fit that narrative because it just doesn't feel natural. Make new ones instead, we need more!I left the cinema wondering why I felt like I just watched a regular action movie. I even thought that maybe it was just me, until I saw the score on IMDB. I don't know if this is because Lilly Wachowski didn't help write this one and they missed a crucial feedback loop. I am glad that at least Lana Watchowski directed it, apparently WB could have gone ahead without them. I don't think the core of the plot wasn't good. It's the details and the execution that perhaps could have been better. Just like I loved the first Equalizer movie with Denzel Washington, but the sequel and the new series with the same concept, wasn't quite the same.If you don't care that much about the matrix trilogy, or perhaps haven't even watched it, this was a reasonable sci-fi action movie, and I can tell that a lot of work was put into it, and I think it was worth watching. Ironically, I thought the action in the John Wick trilogy was better. They did too much of filming simultaneous fights here, instead of focusing on the beautiful choreography of a single martial arts scene. Decent action overall, nonetheless.I don't like being harsh and I hope that this review isn't. There was so much hope for the new Matrix that I must have worried that there could be disappointment. After being let down by the sequel to Coming to America, one of my favourite comedies, which also came two decades later, this was a real possibility. Somehow I must have thought that if someone could do a great sequel after such a high bar, they could.The good news is, the characters are back. Although I am not keen on watching this again, not even for the action, there's still the possibility of yet another sequel. I hope and ask The Watchowskis to team up once more, and come up with something that does the matrix justice. A fifth, and perhaps final instalment, to finish the matrix story with the glory it deserves.",6
3377,"So all the cool kids hate the movie. Guess I'm not cool Watched it 3 times. It's not perfect but it is enjoyable. The problem is it really doesn't cover new ground. Also the agents don't seem to be a real threat in the movie. Another problem is it ends with no real challenge to be faced in future movies. BUT there are some unanswered questions. Action scenes are good but not jaw dropping. The acting is good, the villain is good.",8
3378,"And certainly better than the admittedly low bar set by ""Revolutions,"" which I'd give a 6 (barely above neutral 5, loaded with disappointments).Surprisingly avoids going woke, or to much discernible degree. Some characters are back albeit with new casting, but if you can take that for what it is, well it is what it is. Some new faces to be sure, but the return of old tensions, dynamics, and variant factions was oddly comforting, fitting like an old glove while still able to mix things up with an ""unexpected alliance."" We missed you, indeed.The first hour is essentially a parody of the first/trilogy, sometimes to the point of absurdity. Then it becomes something of a strange but surprisingly compelling mixture of the 3, with some seemingly standout parallels to ""Reloaded"" (my personal favorite, though I'll concede the first is the best film, Reloaded is just loaded with amazing fight sequences).It has more action than the first, which again is the best film film of course, but keeps things on a smaller, more personal scale than ""Revolutions,"" which tried and failed to make some LOTR-styled epic.If you were content with the trilogy's end, be content. If you were disappointed, this may help to resolve the bitter aftertaste that was ""Revolutions,"" whose only redeeming sequence involves ceiling-hopping gimps.7/10 on a strictly MATRIX scale. Better than Revolutions (6), but lesser than the first (10) or second (a personal 10 but objectively 9 or 8).",7
3379,"Is the original Matrix better? Yes, duh.Its this worse than the other two of the ""trilogy"" that never were really needed? No.Did this Resurrection need to happen? No. No Resurrection ""needs"" to happen anyway.If it did happen, as it obviously did, did it need to look more or less like like this? Probably. With all the self-referential Meta and clever (often funny) tricks; from the name ""Binary"" (and the duality implied, which is at the core of the universe) and Matrix-As-Game, to Neil Patrick Harris and Déjà-Vu.This is a smart script, unlike others I did not find it confusing or boring at all. The film is limited by its original matrix (pun intended), but enjoyable overall. It adds very little, and it tries the usual explain-by-not-explaining strategy.But what else was it supposed to do? Not exist? But it does, so... Just take the pill and move on.",6
3380,I loved this..... been an awesome fan of all the movies... this just blew me away.... Amazing is not the word... there are no words.... Love the way they used a lot of the cast from sense 8 because that was bloody amazing too..... watch it .....this movie blew my mind just like the original 3 did...... 11 out of 10.,10
3381,Its 7 score movie but plus 1 for the Ending. So its a 8. Its a good movie. 70% story and 30% action. Maybe they focused on story more in this. So they can put more fight on sequals? Dont know. But its a good movie over all for die hard Matrix fan like me. Will wait for sequal.,8
3382,"All Matrix installments have been good, and this one is no different. With the monotony of what movies are like today it's time for a little weirdness. I'm all for it.",10
3383,"If you were born in the 80's and watched the matrix through the 90's then don't watch this;I loved the Originals and this just pushes it to far, intact all remakes do the same thing, they lose direction half way through.It's all about references these days and it's not for me.",5
3384,"The Matrix was ground breaking in its day. I remember the first time I watched it and being absolutely blown away by its concept and cinemagraphics. Fast forward 22 years...the matrix is some pseudo, woke concept that can only be epitomised by the socio-demographical representation of a man bun.",1
3385,Some people must be plugged out of the matrix with them giving bad ratings just because there confused.My advice give it ago ya its no where as good as the originals but it's ok.,7
3386,The action scenes are actually not as good as the 2nd matrix movie. Yes the cgi is 2021 but the actual fighting is probably worse than in the first movie. This movie just doesn't add anything worth while to the matrix lore.At the end of the movie everything about being the one and neo from the original trilogy got undone.The one? I guess its the two now.,3
3387,Judging from the early ratings it's obvious many didn't understand the film. The Matrix Resurrections did exactly that in bringing back not only the characters from the previous trilogy but continuing the story as well.Everything made perfect sense IF you watch closely and pay attention. I had no problem following the story of how the the resurrection of Neo and his quest to find out what's happened since the truce with the machines so many years ago.Good build up with great action scenes leading to a thrilling climatic ending made this an excellent addition to the Matrix universe.,8
3388,"So, I waited all year for this movie having loved the first 3, esp after watching the commentary explaining all the deeper meaning to each part of the 3 movies. It was a fascinating experience.Well Matrix Resurrections was 2 hours and 27 mins too long. Do yourself a favor and turn it off after the green WB logo leaves the screen. I realized what I was in for as soon as one of the characters said something to the effect of ""WB is making us do a sequel to the trilogy and it would be a break of contract to not go along"" Nice nod to Kevin Smith and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. It was at that point I knew 100% this was a spoof of the original 3 rather than a serious movie. Sadly, the spoofiness was just plain bad with too much reliance on flashbacks to the first 3 movies.The movie had promise (Neo # whatever needed to be freed and he remembered things from his past lives) and the ability to be good, but the terrible script got in the way.I almost stopped the movie 30 minutes in, which is where I stop movies if they don't grab my attention and give them either a thumbs down or 1 star on Netflix. Sadly, HBO Max doesn't have a rating system. I fast forwarded to about the 54 min mark to see if they ever got into the real world, which they did. So I went back and continued from the 30 min point, but had to stop the movie at about the hour point when immediately after Neo is freed Morpheus takes him into a dojo and they fight... wow! Forget any story telling... Exit HBO Max immediately and don't look back!The other odd part is the Matrix in this movie is normal color and the real world was more dark/green... the exact opposite from the first 3 movies...",1
3389,"Blah blah blah for about an hour. We the Matrix fans know the plot. Go to the action ASAP please. Stop the introductions, skip the boring non-sense. I drank 3 wasted martinis. I usually have two and I am super happy with ANY Star Wars films.",4
3390,"But I preferred to watch it in my local theatre.Several points that I found annoying:Jessica Henwick's breathy way to speak her character's dialogues was frustrating, it was barely intelligible and she did it a lot. Had to muster some extra focus just to keep at pace with her words.Keanu was basically John Wick being lost in the Matrix. He was only Neo when he's bald or in the ""real world"".The fights...... so boring. Neo, didn't perform. Only having some sort of energy field around him. C'mon Wachowski... give him some more credits. Even Smith seemed interesting, heck even Dougie Howser was stealing some Quicksilver ability and made his character looked interesting.Some points that I liked:The story. If WB wants another Matrix movie, it's better handled by The Wachowskis.Trinity. And her connection with Neo.Dougie Howser, and his cat.",7
3391,"I really liked the original Matrix movie. The idea was amazing and the execution stunning, even if not perfect. Matrix II was ok, III not so much. Resurrections is some kind of reboot-but-not-reboot of the first movie, with numerous references and scenes that are pretty closely ""copied"" from the original. Which would not be a problem if they were improved, or at least as good, but most give you that feeling of 'I've seen that before, but better'. Yes, a lot of scenes are pale and uninspired 'copies' of scenes already seen previously in the series. And around this, there is some convoluted, confused and unconvincing 'story' trying to explain why Neo has been resurrected and has to be waken up again. And get Trinity back. Which is about the full story. Lots of bland talking, uninspired 'kung fu' and unexciting shootouts. Most of the action is pretty boring and falls flat, villains talk a lot but don't have much personality. The whole thing feels like wasted time and potential. Sad.",4
3392,I can see why all the hate. Its a very different tone with all the self awareness etc and new characters. Its not really a movie to include in a matrix movie marathon. Its one for a new generation. But i did enjoy watching it. The nostalgia got me choked up and excited. Neo and Trinity were great. Few miss casts mainly agent smith. Think of tbis as like a stand alone finale. Or a xmas special lol. I'm giving it a 10 because I don't think all the 1s are fair.,10
3393,"First of all, it's supposed to be meta. It's supposed to be a parody of itself. Lana is too genius for you, it went right over most people's heads. The YouTube movie review haters just didn't get it at all.The Matrix trilogy is a series that deals in binaries. Red pill vs. Blue pill. Man vs. Machine. The Matrix vs. The real world. Free will vs. Destiny. Zeroes and ones, baby. In the first film, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) takes Neo (Keanu Reeves) through a simulation training program, whose only message is that agents can be anyone and anyone can be an agent. ""if you're not one of us, you're one of them,"" he intones.22 years later, the Wachowskis have broken out of their own binaries, coming out as trans women. And only one of them, Lana, chose to return to The Matrix franchise. But it's clear that Wachowski has no taste for the binary anymore, as she delivers a film that shreds much of the original trilogy's ethos.The most striking difference of 'Resurrections' is the collapse of the 'man vs. Machine' narrative. After Neo defeats Agent Smith and (seemingly) dies in the battle, Zion and the machines strike a tentative truce. But Neo's sacrifice inspires many machines to defect from the Deus Ex Machina and join sides with the humans. These beings are called Sentients, adorable droids that work with the city of Io. They are rendered in luminous reflective colors and curved lines, and bear little resemblance to the insect-like sentinels.But it isn't only the worker droids who join the rebellion. The trilogy had plenty of sympathetic programs from the Matrix (like the Oracle) who wanted to help humanity. 'Resurrections' brings these programs into the real world via millions of nanobots that cluster and form into human shapes. These beings now have corporeal form in the real world, where they do stuff like help Io grow strawberries and work to defend the city.So much of 'Resurrections' works to erase the line between man and machine. After his second bout in the Matrix, Neo awakens to have more ports, and more hardware on his neck. And he finds himself not just working with Morpheus, but a Morpheus/Smith hybrid with different abilities (and a flair for fashion). It's a natural extension of Neo's brokered peace with the Deus Ex Machina.It's also an apt metaphor for our increasingly online life, for time spent on our phones or in a Zoom meeting. The man vs. Machine war is over, and our relationship with technology is more deeply entwined than ever. The teenagers who first saw The Matrix in 1999 were a bridge generation, the last to remember a time pre-internet. Nowadays, younger generations don't know a world without it. As one character says in Resurrections, ""I'm a geek. I was raised by machines.""Wachowski's breaking of the binary rewrites the rules of 'The Matrix', but it also addresses our increased dependence on technology. In 1999, cell phones were still a luxury, and the internet was still being discussed as a fad or a temporary innovation. The ensuing two decades have seen an unprecedented leap in technology, and the near constant role it plays in our lives.It's no surprise then that 'Resurrections' finds Thomas Anderson as a successful video game designer, translating his memories of the original trilogy into a game format. His reality transformed into a digital experience within a digital construct that keeps folding in on itself like a mobius strip. The question is no longer how do we defeat the machines, but how we maintain the connections and relationships that make us human.",10
3394,"... and yet the movie is far from it.The Matrix is my favourite trilogy and I have rewatched it countless times. I should say part 2 and 3 are the solid continuations. And I have never hated them.This movie though is opposite. Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but my thoughts during the movie went from ""not that bad"" in first 20 minutes to ""just run the credits"" in the last 20 ones.I'll start from acting. There are good performance from the younger actors, but the original cast is dreary. They are obliged to act, so they act. It can be seen especially well on Keanu's face when he is planning the head shaved Neo.Camera work and editing is lacking too. Sometimes the camera is shaky, a lot of action scenes are felt unfinished in post production or just shot on a smartphone.And I am not even comparing to original trilogy. There, 20 years ago we had impecable fight scenes with 360 degrees continues shot. The choreography of the fights was as beautiful as a dance. Those movies are done better than this one.I actually feel okay towards new Smith, but do not get Morpheus at all. Is he a program now? But he was a human in the original, right? So what happened? I understand new Smith, I understand the changes in the real world, everything but Morpheus.The music is bad too. It does its job right, but it is unmemorable. The huge part of my Matrix enjoyment was the OST. I even watched end credits every time I finished the movie. Here I feel nothing.What I liked is a meta commentary on the sequels that are produced by the company that is insisting on them. And the real opinion on Matrix franchise being outspoken in the movie. But all of that doesn't make the movie great.",6
3395,"I don't know if someone paid for a review bomb or these people watched the same movie. The special effects were amazing unlike everyone is saying. The story did well the integrate the cast changes which weren't at all bad It answers all the questions you have about how to could make a new matrix with the way things ended in the third. For the people say there was too much talking, there was just as much dialogue and setup in the previous films. Long story short, if you liked the previous 3 you will like this one. I recommend at least a watch and realize the negative reviews weren't at all accurate.",8
3396,"The perfect continuation to one of the greatest stories, concepts and films of all time! If you are expecting to be mind blown watch the previous 3, this isn't that. This movie is a refresher on what the Matrix story line has always been, or at least to me, the greatest love story and the power of love. Set aside the sci-fi and simulation theory and you get a background of the truest gift that humans have over any machine, the gift of love. Although understood by the machines as explained in Revolutions, it's clear and has been reiterated in different metaphors all throughout every one of the Matrix trilogy including this new one, that Love is the Key. It's love that pushes the humans survival through the machines, it's Love that gives Neo the ability to push forward. This has always been a Trinity and Neo story, and if you're looking for a conspiracy theory head over to Reddit and you'll find much of that. If you're looking for a great science fiction story that's true to human emotion The Matrix Trilogy and now this new one seals the concept in one sentence. Anything is possible, with Love.",8
3397,"It's okay, they definitely didn't ruin it, but it definitely didn't live up to the hype. The fight scenes were nowhere near as epic as the others and the ending was awful, but it's worth a watch. I grew up with the matrix movies and have always been a big fan, but they just missed the mark. If you've never seen the other movies you'll probably really enjoy it and prior knowledge isn't really needed.",7
3398,"Fell asleep halfway. Needed to watch second half the next day... Just to finish it watching... I think the movie became one more love story. I mean Neo risks the future of human kind for his love??? Who does that, surly not the ONE. They should have put another actress for Niobe's role, a real old lady, Smith's performance was very bad as an old granny. It is more than obvious that they tried to make some money out of this movie in a cheap way...",2
3399,"This movie has lived up to my expectations. Just like the Matrix of 1999, here is a movie you simply don't watch, you study it, for in it is embedded philosophy, metaphysics, science, psychology, theology and every study that attempts at answering the great question of the meaning of life. I love it and just as the first Matrixes, I'm set at watching this time and time again.,",10
3400,"I'm a big fan of the Matrix and just got back from IMAX.The first time I left without waiting for the end.There is simply no logic in the film. Where did the heroes come from? What motivates them? Where is the atmosphere and continuity of the previous parts? Unfortunately, Morpheus in a golden suite and a girl with blue hair, whose name I didn't even remember, have no answer to all these questions...",1
3401,"There are many inconsistencies and inconsistencies.The story, which was beautiful in the past, was turned into a grotesque.There were great expectations. I started watching and from time to time I wanted to turn off the viewing, because all expectations for the plot, the sequence - were not justified. The author's brains have gone to one side.",5
3402,"A lot of Sense8 cast. Acting didn't seem to be their strong suit. Lighting was great, but all wrong. The green hue was absent. Makeup artist went way overboard with hair styles. And story line will definitely require a second watch. I'm a huge Matrix fan...I even skipped a day of work just to watch the original in the theater on opening day. But this one was disappointing. It didn't feel like The Matrix.",5
3403,Had to watch the complete trilogy before this since so many negative reviews were critical about this and how it squared with the Matrix storyline. It does completely but you may need to give it your complete attention to understand how! But if you're not a Matrix die hard then just go with the flow .cause it's a really fun movie and one of the best this year!,10
3404,"It was 1999, I have just arrived in London, being 19 years and all, and while waiting for the bus outside Elephant&amp;Castle tube station, double-deckers red buses passing by with adverts on their side ""WHAT IS THE MATRIX?"".Just that! What is the Matrix? The question resonated, but no answer in the media. Fast-foward, a few months later entering the cinema, with a couple of friends to watch The Matrix; we had inhaled a tiny bit of the mildest recreational substance and sat down with popcorn and Sprite.The opening scene, I consider it to be one of the best opening scenes in cinematic history, and I have watched thousand of movies. I was amazed, since I couldn't tell if Trinity was friend or foe. I was stunned! My mind worked overtime as I was trying to watch the movie, while a part of my brain was analysing a very simple question; how do we know that we are in the Matrix, if we don't know that the Matrix even exists? How reality can be defined? To this day, there is no answer, since we have no point of reference, yet.As Neo was going down the rabbit hole, I was immersing in the Matrix. The movie ended and I immediatelly told my mates that this is the best movie I've watched. 2021, it still is one of the best, in its genre at least.The Matrix 4, did not give me this feeling. I was expecting this. The first part of Matrix 4 was amazing and well-worked and the Analyst gave a mesmerising performance throughout, along with Neo and Smith.There was a major gap in Matrix 4. For those who remember, Neo had the ability to inlfuence machines outside the Matrix (destroyed a sentinel, while he could ""see"" the machines when blinded. Therefore, it hinted that there may be a Matrix within the Matrix (Inception movie). I thought that this would be the core of Matrix 4, as it would make sense concerning the ""resurrections"" part of the title. It was not. I know it would have perplexed things further, but this would have made for an awesome come-back, wouldn't it?The action scenes were rushed, underbudget (humble opinion) and the characters not well-built. It had potential, but I think it was overshadowed by the ""binary effect"" that may be what the director was feeling after some life-altering changes that she went through. I think it was a very personal movie from the Director's perspective.",6
3405,"Imagine the first Matrix, done with today's cheap and fake Netflix style. This is what you're gonna watch.I expected an epic new story and all I got was a commercial for the old one.It worked, because I stopped it half way through and played the first one.",3
3406,"While few movies period are as good as the original, this was a solid movie that had many similarities to the original along with some great new actors and characters.This was far better than both sequels and while it's a nice stand alone movie, a sequel or sequels could be made, not that it's necessary.The first two sequels were not necessary as the first movie, had it stopped there, would have been thought of as one of the better movies or at least sci fi movies ever.But since the sequels were made, this was a nice addition to get The Matrix back to it's roots.Too many probably either don't like sequels of great movies to be made and therefore give it a low rating despite not watching it, or only measure it relative to the original rather than all movies, of which most of what is out there is crap and unoriginal like this.Movies like this with so much thought put into them, and sci fi movies in general are far too rare, so it is a shame people don't enjoy unique, original sci fi any more.About the only real complaint I have is that the first 45 minutes or so could have been cut in half. I also enjoyed the inclusion of at least 3 of the main characters from Sense8.",7
3407,"The first part of the movie feels like the first and best part of the first trilogy. The second part however falls flat, predictable and bland like the 2nd and 3rd parts of the trilogy. But still, this is an interesting take on the concept. I would give this an 8 if Neil Patrick Harris wasn't in it. He was horrible.",7
3408,"Literally. It's not amazing. It's not terrible. It just is. Pretty clever writing with the story line, but does some odd jumping around at times that can be confusing without explanation. Some of the characters fall completely flat. Disappointed there was no iconic soundtrack. The original Matrix films had memorable music to accompany the scenes. All in all it's the 4th best Matrix movie. Could it be from not having both Wachowskis at the helm?",4
3409,"I must say that the Matrix trilogy was simply fantastic despite some small but negligible problems with really deep meanings, but let's go back to a few months ago when the fourth chapter of the Matrix was announced. Panic, when I learned that a fourth chapter of the Matrix was in the works I felt bad because trying to resurrect a saga of almost twenty years ago is a risky thing especially when you talk about a saga that has literally made the history of cinema. Then the very first trailer came out and I must say that I was very convinced but it's also true that you can't judge a book by its cover and seeing Trinity and Neo together again after years was simply exciting. Then finally it came out in the theaters and I was simply nervous because I didn't know what to expect from a sequel of a saga as important as ""confused"". Now, what I can say about this fourth chapter is that it's very good if we talk about the CGI, which has always been the strong point of the Matrix, if we talk about the plot it's good but honestly I found it useless in some aspects and with some explanations put just to find an excuse for some things. There's a dose of fan-service that isn't too intrusive but on the contrary I found it almost pleasant except for some little things that you can see were put in just for the fans. From a direction point of view we're there because I think Lana Wachowski was born to be behind a camera but the real problem of this Matrix is that it's not the Matrix, that is, the trilogy had a deep meaning behind it, it analyzed the definition of reality and choice leading the viewer to ask himself a thousand questions, but this fourth chapter didn't have a sense of existence they just wanted to attract the fans to the cinema again. And you can feel this throughout the film, in some early parts you can see the fact that they were almost forced to make a fourth chapter. Finally, if I have to summarize my opinion I can say that it's a very good movie technically speaking but poor narratively because there was simply no need.",7
3410,You will need to watch it several times in order to unpack its full meaning. There is a lot hidden in plain sight! I'm pretty sure that this is an occult movie! Just try to watch it slowly which means you will need to pause a lot and carefully analyze what you see...,10
3411,"Bottom line.... It's a new story. This is as if someone wrote fan fiction about the Matrix and Lana said, ""yea, I'll make a movie about that fan fiction."" Not what you think, open your mind, it's a good story.",6
3412,"I was expecting this but of course wanted to give it a chance because I love the original trilogy.The plot was extremely thin. No story at all. It really felt like I was just watching nothing. And the build up was so not worth the final scene. If they make another one , I will be pissed and probably won't watch it. I love Keanu Reeves though.",2
3413,"The movie should've been named ""reminisce"" instead of ""resurrection"". It's good they showed snippets from past movies cause i can't remember what has happened, but like every 10 minutes? It's feels like i'm a watching a clip show for a season finale, but omfg lawd how hot young Keanu was!The sfx still gives me the ooohs and ahhhs like in every matrixs, but the action / fighting scenes is definitely on the lower grade than previous movies, it's just not as clean. In conclusion, new agent smith looked like he's into some kinky isht.",6
3414,The writing was so lazy like nothing that happened throughout the movie really had a purpose. Elements to the plot seemed to be pulled from thin air. At best the movie briefly brought back good memories of the previous three then quickly threw up on those memories with a boring pointless storyline. The Matrix should have remained a trilogy.,1
3415,"I thought a perfect sequel to the trilogy couldn't exist. And it doesn't. But this movie is the perfect loveletter to it. It feels as if it was made for me. My life was heavily affected by the original trilogy, and I was afraid this would ruin all my memories. I had all my guards up, but never needed them. I'm grateful this exists. I don't care what others think about it. I've watched the original trilogy close to 50 times, and this movie just feels *RIGHT*. I am a happier man today for having seen it. Thank you!EDIT: Why I loved this movie:1. It doesn't retcon anything from the original trilogy. It doesn't go from 0 to ""Morpheus was gay the whole time"" like J. K. did.2. It is tonally completely different from the original trilogy, which allows me to easily separate it from it, and not be forced to consider it an inegral part of the franchise.3. Neo's new setting perfectly explains the duality of his soft and dramatic new persona, and Keanu's wooden acting.4. The movie parodies the circumstances of its forced creation while at the same time being a tribute to the original material.5. Action scenes are clean and GCI is not annoying, unlike ""Reloaded"".7. The expendable cast mostly stays out of the way.8. The drama and romance elements that had no real chance to sneak in the original trilogy are fully developed.9. The new ""evolved"" Smith is terribly out of place, but shows an interesting potential plot point about the unwilling humanization of the most mysantropic character imaginable, when faced with the reality of his own failures.10. TRINITY &lt;3This movie, regardless of how it is being marketed by WB, is a 50% parody 50% tribute, and as such, is absolutely brilliant.",10
3416,"...you only saw the original trilogy once and not recently. I watched it with my brother in law. He hadn't seen the originals since they first came out, and he hated the new one because he was lost through most of it. I've seen the originals more times than I can count, so I understood the complex storyline and really enjoyed the movie. In fact, I'll probably watch it again to see what I can pick to that I may have missed the first time.If you haven't seen the original trilogy recently, do yourself a favor and watch them before watching this one. That doesn't mean you'll like it, but at least there's a better chance you will.",8
3417,"Just like in the first movie, the first half was very boring. Let me be frank, my eyes sought the charisma of Morpheus. Even ex-agent smith. But time makes people very different in 20 years. I heard from the matrix fans who watched the movie that the movie wasn't what they expected, they just missed it. So even though I started with low expectations, I was so bored for the first hour and a half that I can't tell. But the last 45 minutes were really full of action and a legendary trinity emerged. Yes, this time trinity took the movie away and I think it was very good. Neo's love for her was also very beautiful. Blowing up everyone on first contact. The surprise was agent smith. With an unexpected reunion. Did i like the movie? I think it was good. Will i watch it one more time? Maybe. Did it meet my expectation? Never. So what did i do? I would be longing.",7
3418,"I loved this movie, it brought back enough old stuff to feel connected. But also enough new stuff that explored areas were the movies didnt go before. This time around the question wasnt what is the matrix? Already knowing what the matrix is , what is my place in it or were do i fit in, now that the world has moved on . To be honest the fighting wasnt filmed as well as the old movies but the dialoge were a lot clearer when explaining the inner works of the matrix. Also had some good humor that didnt feel forced and a lot of exciting moments. I was so thrilled when i learned a couple years back that this movie was in the making and now it is finaly here. And it was better then i hoped for and im gratefull that they made it. This can be a lesson to the movie studios when making a reboot you should let the original makers get free reign instead of letting a marketing team decide what was importent.",10
3419,"The Matrix series should have stopped after the first. It's been down hill ever since and M4 doesn't make things better. If you haven't seen the first three, half the film is made up of flashbacks from them, so you won't need to.",5
3420,"When you have to stop a movie 3 times because its annoying you so much then it proves how bad this is. I wanted to finish it to see if it ever lived up to the hype or anything relating to the original trilogy but no it really doesnt. Probably the most boring 2 and half hours that makes no sense.I cant think there were any positives to this movie, even seeing Reeves and Moss back together just filled me with the feeling that they took this film just for the pay check. I almost think that Fishbourne had seen the script and passed but was told that he cant say he'd passed on the movie. I love Yahya Abdul-Mateen II hes been in some great movie but then like the Candyman remake/ reboot that was awful as well! His Black Mirror inspired version of Morpheus where he was a program of the original character was just so 1 dimensional. The whole ""story"" of this was like if you imagine the director telling a 5 year old what the original matrix was. Then being told to draw a picture and that is what they used that as the starting point of the movie. Then allowing that same 5 year old to watch the first Matrix then telling you what the matrix and then both of then trying to rip off/ copy that same story with different actors.All the new characters were just carbon copies of better more fleshed out characters from the original Matrix. None of that feel was able to be replicated in this movie. That real dark gritty story just turned into a CGI fest of over used quotes for no effect on the story. I cant even remember what happened in this film and honestly its the best way to think about it. It truly ruined the nostalgia trip that i thought this would have been just ended up being a steaming pile of nothingness with problem that aren't remotely relevant in the Matrix universe.",5
3421,...architect. The only way the architect applies to manage the imponderability is to operate in the Matrix without he knows about its identity in order to manage the variable of the choice. He assumes an identity in opposite to the Matrix so to manage the variable to preserve its dominion on humanity.,
3422,"In 2019, Ron and Lynne Wachowski, the Wachowskis's parents, passed away alongside a close friend of Lana's, with her father passing away first, her friend second and her mother third. After not being able to process that kind of grief, Lana suddenly conceived the story of The Matrix Resurrections one sleepless night.In her words, Lana felt that while she couldn't have her parents back, she then could have Neo and Trinity back, feeling very comforted to see them alive again.The Matrix Resurrections meta-element makes it the most personal entry into the franchise to date.Before the Matrix 4 I have never been a witness of negations over a multimillion dollar franchise. Between a celebrated filmmaker such as Lana Wachowski and executives (""the Suits"") from a movie studio such as Warner Brothers. After finishing the film I'm grateful to have that conversation under my belt as if it was my own experience. It reminds me how illuminating and informative it can be when emotional rollercoasters of this proportion are out into the open.I'm still surprised this therapy session of a script was green-lit. Grateful to bare witness to Lana exploring characters she and many others love. Helping her deal with her grief. Sending us off with a personal answer as to why she agreed on making a fourth film. Brilliantly woven into Neo and Trinity's (Lana) final scene with the Analyst (Warner Bros). Where they fly in to say thank you. ""We're not here to negotiate anything. We were on our way to remake your world. Change a few things. Just remind people what a free mind can do. You gave us something we never thought we could have... another chance.""Reading other negative reviews here I feel sorry for the limited minds of those who wrote them. For still not being able to grasp Lana's personal message to them as one human to another. Many reviews feel old and repetitive to me. She voiced so many of these opinions in the movie during the ""M-IV"" meta-think-tank scene. We can see that she agrees with most of us that 1999's Matrix remains the best one and that the sequels were a mere product of capitalist exploitation by studio execs. Is there an echo in here?The ""What's The Matrix about?"" scene. In under five minutes, Lana Wachowski and Co. Take a shot at a host of factions who've blindly thrust their own, often messed-up worldviews onto the original film, as well as the deeply IP-obsessed film industry. It's hard to describe how thrilling it is to see a filmmaker stare down an audience so accustomed to fan service and be like, ""Nah, I'm not giving you what you think you want.""The studio definitely deserves a 1 to 4 star rating for trying to make money by reviving a journey that was completed. However the writer/director, cast and crew of this film deserves an absolute 8 to 10 star rating, why? Because The Matrix Resurrections is one of the most if not the only HONEST franchise movies I have seen thus far!Thank you Lana. For reminding those who forgot or where on their way of forgettingI'd like to end this review with some of Lana's last words on the page. ""Face reality people. Movies are dead, games are dead. Narrative, dead. Media is nothing but neuro-trigger response and viral conditioning""",8
3423,"One of the best trilogies that I fondly remember growing up; was so looking forward to this movie. Right from the start, it tries to hit the nostalgia...and that's about the only thing it hits.Story itself lost everything that made the special: the question of what is reality. Feels too cramped, too stuffed. I wanted to like it, to see where the Matrix ended up and it just left me... disappointed. It was a chore to get through. More then once, I felt disinterest, that, if I turned it off, I wouldn't miss anything.",4
3424,"Amazing movie and storyline. If you liked the original The Matrix, this movie is gonna blow your mind. Perfect acting and photography. This is gonna win every Oscar for sure. Everyone is talking about this movie and how it transformed their lives.",10
3425,"It's a continuation of an awesome story. As a die hard fan, I loved it! Great action, lots of nostalgia, more world building, more Matrix!!! I recommend this to people who enjoyed the first 3.",10
3426,"Somebody mentioned Cyrstal Skull here, which is interesting because like with ROTLA, it's the fourth installment in a franchise which is a fan favorite but, realistically, mostly because of the original movie in both cases, because the sequels were meh. For Matrix, Ep. 2 was just ok and Ep. 3 was awful. For ROTLA, Ep. 2 was awful and Ep. 3 was... just ok.In both cases, you get the sense that a perfect movie that was meant to be standalone was dragged into sequels because of its success--and neither were meant to be multi-part franchises.It's not as bad as Crystal Skull but it's not that great either--and all the more disappointing because they've had 20 years to rethink what ruined the sequels the first time around--and still don't get it. One word: ZIon.Recall that in the first movie we never went to Zion--it was just talked about. Most of the movie was up top or in simulations of the Matrix. There were scenes down below in the ship, but just the right amount. In Eps 2 and 3 we spent way too much time in Zion, and it crushed the momentum. People in Star Wars castoff costumes rambling on endlessly about God knows what was not the wit we loved about Ep. 1. Nor was there action happening.That said, here's the good and the bad:GOOD-Keanu and Carrie Ann are great; they step right back into these roles without missing a beat. Keanu brings a palpable sadness to Neo that's new.-NPH is great and so is Jonathan Groff--they clearly dig into their roles here.-The opening scenes when Neo (Thomas) appears are fun--there's a palpable sense of some impending, inevitable event coming and they tease it perfectly.-The Matrix is *in color* this time! Not the green-tinted one we remember from before. It's jarring, but cool.-There's some laughs in this movie, which were completely absent from Eps 2 and 3.-The ""White Rabbit"" sequence (yes they actually use it in the film, not just the trailer) is probably the coolest montage in the movie.THE BAD-ZIon. Sure enough, once the film detours to ZIon/down under/whatever Zion is called now it's a momentum killer. Inexplicably, the Jada Pinkett Smith character is brought back--she's in the new Zion--and for some reason she's aged radically while Neo and Trinity look like, well, Keanu and Carrie Ann 20 years later (they put extensive makeup on JPS). Every time they cut to this story line I was looking at my watch, just like in Eps 2 and 3. Zion is NOT. INTERESTING. And the least of the reasons we liked The Matrix.-The movie is almost a remake of the original, most notably in the opening scene, which is virtually a shot-by-shot recreation of the original's opening. Why?-The fight scenes are way too long (which started in Ep 2) and rely on the same moves/camera tricks/staging from 20 years ago, when this was brand new. Some of the fight choreography in fact is directly stolen from Ep 1. Again: why?-They literally--I'm not kidding--deploy the meta concept of ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" here, but with a twist. Whether or not that works is up to you.-Continuing the plundering of Ep 1, they even put in the RATM final song as the closer here again. While that was THE perfect song to end Ep 1, here it's a bad cover version which has nowhere near the impact. Again: why? There's been no great song in the past 20 years that could have closed this?Is it worth seeing? Sure. Will you watch it again? Probably not. There was an opportunity here to rethink or add to everything that made Ep 1 great, but it was missed. The idea that Neo &amp; Trinity formed a bond that survives any/every iteration of the Matrix was intriguing and the most interesting part of this good-looking mess.",5
3427,I wish they didn't make this scumbag. The actors were a bunch of clowns. They mocked the original movie which is a masterpiece in the truest sense of the word. They will never be able to repeat it again.,1
3428,"Sadly a disappointing movie with mediocre action and low effort story .Did not leave an impression on me, I still think it was a waste of effort for 4th move.There was no need whatsoever for this.Yea sure like most movies today just a quick money grab for the name,I think this is also like this.So yea disappointing in the end :/",5
3429,"I'd read reviews and expected it to be bad, but it's really really bad. How could they get it so wrong. Shame on them. Thank fully you can watch it for free.",1
3430,"As my title suggests it was pretty good for the first 30 minutes or so. Some nice little word play and skill used to get things going, a bit OTT on the flashbacks but I can live with that. Unfortunately after that it became entirely forgettable. I can't remember the ending now and I only watched it yesterday. Overall, it was fine. Definitely not something I'd go out of my way to watch again but I'll give it a rewatch when it reaches TV. There better hadn't be a fifth.",6
3431,"No spoilers here, just opinionated truth.I cannot believe Keanu read that script and thought it was a winner. I know Lawrence Fishburn is grateful to have been left out of this one after the release. Why kill a good thing? One Matrix was enough. Two was pushing it, but it was tastefully done. Three started the decline, but four was the last shovel of dirt on the casket. All M4 had going for it was hope. I kept hoping the story would get better as I watched, but it never did.",5
3432,"How can a film made decades later have way worse special effects and fight scenes than any of the previous films? Watch The Matrix Resurrections, or better yet don't bother, and honestly tell me they are not far worse.I lost count of how many flashback scenes from the earlier movies at about 20. The flashback scenes were more enjoyable than the actual movie, which lacked action, and lacked a good story line.Midway through the movie you WILL be fighting the urge to either fall asleep or leave the theater to get more popcorn or use the restroom - no worries, you won't miss anything.Carrie Ann Moss and Keanu Reeves were at their best in the acting, but they could not save this boring, lame, made-for-tv type feeling movie.Kinda felt like a Marvel movie where the super heroes never show up. The actor that took over the Morpheus role, tried and did okay, but sorry, it felt fake and more of a weak imitation than a character you actually cared about. Without the original actor as agent Smith, this movie should not have ever been made. I do not know a single person that actually liked this movie. What a disapointment of a movie. Havent been this let down by a movie since Ja Ja Binks.",2
3433,"This one was the worse. Next to a low budget TV episode:Bad script, bad acting, bad special effects and some of the soundtracks are from the previous parts.",5
3434,"Definitely missing Hugo Weaving from the casting, that made Agent Smith in my eyes, and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus.The story is just so weak with a lots of unnecessary nonsense within the first quarter, and definitely not better then any of the previous 3 movies without a shadow of a doubt, maybe the 10s within this listing watched a different movie? My advice is, revisit the first 3 movies and Just watch all 4 movies back to back.",4
3435,"I applaud Lana Wachowski for doing what she wanted and for literally &amp; figuratively giving EVERYONE the middle finger with a movie that makes fun of itself &amp; the audience, but still wants to tell a story. Yeah, it's an obvious cash grab, but Lana knew what she wanted and it's very satisfying to see her do her way. It's neither great nor bad, didn't love or hate it, it's entertaining and funny at times.",6
3436,"This movies smith made me sick🤢 with his acting I was disgusted coz he sucked with his dialogues never was convincing I was like what the hell directors were thinking ?? Lots of dumb acting in this movie except for neo and trinity and to add Sati did fine... story line was nothing great Matrix: Resurrections. The Wachowski wool ribbon recovers for the great protagonists of the original films, but the creative result was more than disappointing. Little or nothing carried a new delivery too erratic most of the time.",4
3437,"My expectations were very low, so I can fairly say that all in all it was slightly better than I expected, however it doesn't seem to be the same Matrix that became a global phenomenon.Needles to say, the original movie with all its uniqueness and creativity took the world of cinema by storm, a bold Sci-Fi with original ideas, gripping story with the right amount of philosophical thoughts to pick your brain it became such a classic movie that to this day on pop culture we keep making references to it after all these years.Its sequels had a very hard job given the expectations were so high, and although for me, specially the third installment, wasn't as satisfying as the original they had the story wrapped so once I heard they were bringing the franchise back, my thoughts were, from experience I now that is very hard to revive old material and the odds of it being good are very smallThe actors did a terrific job, both Keanu and Carrie-Ann brought realism to their depictions and they did embody their old roles perfectly in my opinion, and also the movie itself does throw some interesting themes and topics at times but that's not enough.The explanation on how all of this world and characters are brought back is farfetched, but if you look past that for a moment to try and enjoy the movie there are still several elements that don't quite fit in a Matrix film; it feels like a goofy version of the old ones where the comedy attempts feels very forced, the fighting doesn't seem consistent with what we saw previously and for some reason they decided to bring old actors and leaving two very important ones behind: Morpheus and Smith.Based on the plot both of them could easily be a part of the movie, and they were such iconic figures that becomes very hard to replace them and I don't think their replacements did them justice.I would say that it feels so outside of the original trilogy that you almost could enjoy it as a standalone, although of course a lot of elements of the story would go above your head, you might like it but I don't see a reason to bring the old material back unless there was a spark of genius on the writers creativity, but this wasn't it.",6
3438,The thing that sets this movie apart from the original trilogy is that that it doesn't do anything we haven't seen before in the hundred action movies that have come out since their debute in 1999.It is so aware of itself that it understands this and makes jokes at it own expense but does little else to address its failings. It could have been something great but it's desperate to recapture the magic by re using and reskinning old characters instead of developing its cast of new characters. It's action scenes don't have the same impact.,6
3439,"Forced myself to carry on watching thinking its got to get better....but it never did &amp; after wasting 1hr 20mins of my life I gave up. Utter nonsense &amp; clearly just a commercial exercise to cash in on the Matrix brand but with no intention to add anything meaningful to it.The producers clearly hoped that the scattering of references to past Matrix films would keep the enthusiast hooked.Sorry fellas, you failed. Miserably.",2
3440,"If you take out all the ""reminder"" clips from the original trilogy you have a big nothing. Way too many connections to the original movies. Why can't the writers just write a extension of the original plot? It was very light on plot and was quite tedious to watch. This movie did not move the story forward at all. It was nice to see some of the original characters but without plot they had nothing to work with. Not sorry I watched it but probably won't watch it again.",4
3441,"Look here: I do not agree with the slant of the writers and directors of this movie, and any slant they encapsulated into this movie is so subtle I couldn't see it. This is such an underrated movie I can't remember Ben begin to explain why. It respected the original work, created a new spin.For those who think it's a money grab, you're the same one giving Spider-Man a 10. For those who think it's woke, you just can't put your opinions aside and see the movie objectively.Go in with an open mind, not a closed one. This movie is worth watching. Sure it has some flaws, but name a movie that doesn't!? It's entertaining, and that's what movies should always be about.",7
3442,"This is a steaming pile of garbage. I can't believe the actors actually signed up for such a terrible story and script. I guess we know which Wachowski brother did the important work on the original film. First the film starts identical to the original movie then gets worse from there. It's like they said how do we do an opening as good as the first matrix? Then said lets copy the first one and add some voyeurism. Neo sucked, new morpheus sucked even harder, what a terrible actor. Every good character the original trilogy had was completely destroyed in the making of this film. Best you stay away from this trash.",1
3443,"Sadly a terrible movie. I liked the first 3 alot, but this is... a real dissapointment. Everything is on replay like they choose to cram the first 3 movies into the last one. Terrible action scenes.",2
3444,The worst out of the series. Shame on whoever approved this piece of s.... to ever come on the screen. The worst movie that I've seen in the last 10 years.,1
3445,"The only good thing I have to say about this movie is that I was able to stream it, which meant I didn't have to sit through it all at once. The only reason I actually FINISHED it was HOPE. Sadly, hope that never came to reality.2 stars for some good effects.2 stars because it's Keanu.Without those two things, this movie is a zero.",4
3446,"I get that not everyone is going to love this movie as much as I did. I love the way it critiques culture and society. The way it asks us to question our own conscious and unconscious beliefs and expectations of the world. Do we want to follow the group-consensus blue-pill narrative of the culture-at-large, or do we want to take the red-pill dive into our individually unique subjective realities? I appreciate the way this movie explores these questions in a more life-affirming way than the previous Matrix movies. Seeing organic and artificial intelligence peacefully co-exist rather than war with each other was beautiful and inspirational.",10
3447,"That's all that need to said. This should never have happened, the script, the pace, the directing is so bad, some of the acting and scenes are the only thing that were not do bad .",1
3448,"I'm struggling to remember the movie only a week later.There was nothing new, aside a few modern updates to reflect the current technology.The story is somewhat ridiculous and escalates in a very predictable cliche way.Massive letdown.",5
3449,This movie talk about the power of feelings and the wonderfull things what could brings with it but unfortunately there is no feeling at all in this movie. This is just an other entertainement pleasant and boring at the same time. It's nice to see Neo and Trinity back again but the chimistery is long gone.So predictable... too bad !,5
3450,"This movie feels a bit desperate, like the script was written in a couple of hours. The problem is that its boring, you never get any real interest in the movie, there is nothing that really grabs you and keep you interested. One thing, i believe these people know about the mass effect games, i felt a few masked similarities and a sheperd is in this movie and vall Neo a legend. Id would actually rather see a well made mass effect trilogy then more matrix movies.",3
3451,"Matric is slick, elegant, one-of-a kind. This last movie is not. It is trying to be so many things that it never was and will not be - a Marvel series. The movie is long, loses the plot at times, too much talking and then just suddenly a fight scene which is just plain boring. In the end Neo just flies around and stops the bullets from flying. I don't understand who is the audience for the movie any longer.",2
3452,"There were some good ideas, but overall the movie left me with nothing. While the first triolgy had very clean action sequences while the resurrections had chaos and felt nothing but ordinary.Why have you forsaken me, disappointed 😞",4
3453,Just blunt a lot of repeat actions from the earlier movies. It is an average movie with very little new stuff. I hope they could make the next movies as good as the first with badass action and better story.,5
3454,"A total waste of time and money for those who paid for it (luckily not me).It would be much better to see that not only matrix was virtual reality but also Zion, that matrix is just a test virtual reality destined to test some programs and podded people and when some of those people want freedom, they are moved to Zion with illusion of freedom, while those who are safe are moved to live\real virtual reality - i.e. Metaverse (this name would be funny).Also. It would be more real to put humans behind the robots\AI. AI can never learn to go in depth of thinking and adapting. Putting some wealthy or crazy humans as creators and admins of virtual realities (matrix, zion, metaverse..) would explain the motifs ""AI"".",1
3455,"Expectations for the film were high.But I had to lower my expectations a lot. Because this picture is terrible, it is simply not needed, because the story of the original was finished in a logical way; and what we got now feels like a spit in the face.Yes, it was possible to come up with an interesting concept and develop the story further, but even fan theories about the plot of the sequel, of which there were a lot after the announcement of the fourth part, were a cut above and more interesting than what we got in the end.",3
3456,"I am a huge fan of the Matrix. I can not hide it. But I have tried to keep my expectations at a moderate level when watching this new installment. Now, after the premiere, I can say that I am more than satisfied with the result. There are some technical and artistic aspects that I have not liked very much, but they are not enough to tarnish the film. Again, giving a movie like this a star is very unfair. I will wait patiently for what the future may bring us.",8
3457,"With a promising meta narrative and fresh sci-fi ideas, the Matrix Resurrections misses the mark by overindulging into meta irony. The countless references and jokes about the first Matrix film unintentionally forces the story backwards instead of forwards. Ultimately, this new sequel-reboot muddles up what it wants to say, or rather, what the audience should be deeply pondering about afterwards.Written and directed by Lana Wachowski, Resurrections began intriguingly and delivered the trippy sensation that there was something off-kilter with reality, much like how Keanu Reeves' Thomas Anderson feels. It had me wondering if Zion and the real world was another construct of the Matrix.The themes of living in the past and the story of Thomas Anderson working as a successful video game designer were captivating and original. The story of what happened to the machines and humans post-trilogy was fascinating and left much more to be desired. I wished the story drew more from those fresher elements. If only there was an Animatrix sequel that could fill in the gaps to that story.The film's meta approach was the equivalent of pointing a video camera at a TV and cracking jokes about the infinite amount of TV frames. At its best moments, it had the wittiness of Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation and brilliantly fools the audience with their established knowledge of the trilogy. At its worst moments, the meta tone was on-the-nose and lame like the Julia Roberts gag from Ocean's Twelve.There's a moment when a character references Warner Bros and it was like the film swung a bat at my face and completely unplugged me out of the illusion of the story. There were jokes about studio pressure on retelling established franchises to make money and this is where it got too meta. From then onwards, I watched the film in a daze and started noticing the construct of the film itself.That is the intended joke, I guess. I understood the gag, but was it that funny to begin with?The new Morpheus and Agent Smith were hard to go along with. It was no fault of the new actors themselves but it was difficult to replace Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving in their iconic roles in my head.The action is, compared to the first three films, disappointing. The martial arts fights are choreographed by a new stunt coordinator, not Yuen Woo Ping from the original films. The difference shows. The fights use quick cuts that deliberately hide the hits, and perhaps to accommodate the lead actors' ages.Keanu Reeves has settled into Neo/Thomas Anderson and much more sure footed than he was in the original trilogy. Reeves sold the dissatisfaction with the dream world much better here than in the first Matrix.The love story with Carrie-Ann Moss' Trinity was the best part and the intended heart of the story, but it unfortunately develops too late. Resurrections was so preoccupied with its second act juggling all these other grandiose sci-fi ideas that it commits the sin of not killing its darlings.With no clear protagonist and theme, The Matrix Resurrections' relentless meta references tired me out. What happened next for the rest of the film was easy to guess. At the end, the film became the very thing that it was mocking: a commercial remake that told the same story again.The irony was so ironic that it went to the other side and became unironic again. I walked out of the theater all confused, not questioning my reality like we all did in 1999, but questioning who approved this script.",6
3458,"Won't be a revelation that seasoning some below-average movie with a big name from the past is a hot recipe today. It's almost boring to see how Resurrections scores all the points in lame lazy-made film bingo (watching was more tiresome though). Yes, I see the return of iconic characters, what I don't see - is the reason for this return. The biggest problem of the movie is that characters resemble puppets - they just have no motivation to do what they're doing. Thomas Anderson acts by the circumstances or is being ordered around by new guys, showing only the empty husk of a character he used to be. Trinity just exists and centering the ending on her makes it weird. Agent Smith (new actor's looks made me laugh at his attempts to be Smith, they could have at least tried to find someone similar) just whoops every character he sees... because reasons? His motives slipped away from me entirely. The new guys... well, I guess I can commend them on being diverse, because that's everything they bring to the movie. The main idea of the film shifted from war on machines to reuniting Thomas with Trinity and... neither of them really try to get together, because Trinity is a princess that needs to be saved during the film (and strong and independent woman in the end, looks unbelievably artificial) and Thomas, yeah, just follows the new guys. Yes, you can see where the money went when it comes to the image, but the picture is the only pleasant thing about the movie.",3
3459,I was a huge Matrix fan - but have mixed feelings about this film. Neo looked to much like John Wick and I have loved Keanu since Point Break....so - it was too distracting. The flashbacks helped the movie - but it seemed to drag along. I may watch it again as may have been my mood.,6
3460,"The film is brilliant, and allows surprising me with an amazing plot and trepidant filming. Keeps me on the seat every time with intelligence, and passion. Thanks a lot for this film.",10
3461,"Do not waste your time, this movie is as bad as the second and third ones if not worse. Not sure why they felt they needed to make this terrible of a movie. Completely disjointed, some sort of soap opera at times and just terrible in every sense of the word. I truly wish I had never wasted the time it took to watch this terrible terrible creation of a movie. If I were an actor in this movie I would ask to have my name removed from the credits.",1
3462,"I saw the movie today , it was awesome I liked the characters/ the story / the CGI I really enjoyed every single minute of watching it. Full of beautiful events/ but you need to see the trilogy first before watching matrix resurrections everyone was excited in the cinema I'm pretty sure that this sequel will win a lot of awards just like the original one / don't miss the movie it's really fantastic/it's a love story/ it has some great action scenes , full of many deja vu so many people were in the cinema to see it after 20 years since matrix revolutions. I'm happy to see this movie today hope you enjoy it too dear friends.",10
3463,"Its really not a movie, rather old cast gathering, worth a Christmas episode on chanel 5. None of the cast or crew have actually tried to make a movie, they just worked hard on making an absolute zero quality trailer.",1
3464,"Not a Matrix movie we all know and love but maybe this movie maybe a set up for future Matrix ? The first hour is odd as I think everyone can agree, not enough action in my opinion and definitely not the classic Matrix style action we've seen in the past trilogy. Mixed feelings about this new direction Lana has taken and obviously the ending was left open to future sequels depending on how well it does in the box office of coarse. I wouldn't say it was bad and I wouldn't say it was bad. I hope if they make sequels they go back to the roots which made The Matrix so iconic. Bring back that damn clean action sequences and fight scenes, no one likes the plain old quick cut action scenes anymore it's just very sloppy to me and half the time you don't know what's even going on.",10
3465,A great job of reintroducing us to the Matrix with awesome new characters and some we already know! The story is adapted perfectly to the current time and addresses some of loose ends of the first trilogy. It was a great experience. The Matrix is RESURRECTED!!!,10

3467,"So ....After see the general reviews I found my self with a choice... do I gone lose my precious time on a movie, that I oved the first trilogy or used this time to watch a better rated movie, but everyone already should know that there's no choice, because it was already made...I enjoyed almost every part of this deliveryThe narrative of the movie with the real choice of bring this 4rd delivery to life (warner bros, contract, etc)The dialogue of the first trilogy and to this one, the nostalgy and what is new.The healthy balance of the old acters and the new ones.The new (analyst) jus great acting ...the only thing I really didn't like, and make lost that extra star... was the new smith choice. Incredible fail of casting, I missed the old smith, it was scary just hearing him to talkThis one new to me seems a common jerkand with this ... I really don't understand the bad reviews and like other movies like fast furious are so overrating... this movie is more than action movie is a movie to reflect about the reality and I loved how they were this time to included even more the idea that we could be living on a matrix...for me is like I go to a restaurant and I choose a spicy or salted food and then complain that is not sweet, and is to salty or hot!!!How lucky that the choice was already made, logging for the next deliver.",9
3468,Let's be brutally honest here. I knew this film would be terrible I set my self up for that upon hearing it was being made.Wow. Just wow. Down your throat wokeness. Even managed to ruin agent Smith... Mr Anderson. You all heard the voice reading that. Honestly my 1st and only review.Horrific but expected in today's world.Next time follow the Animatrix spin off that was golden.,2
3469,"Lana Wachowski does a horrible job, she should never jump into something she has no knowledge to direct. Clearly uses the family name as a catch-up. Avoid it and avoid Lana Wachowski as a director in the future.",1

3471,The acting is terrible and the script is a joke. What a waste.Why use so many flashbacks and copy paste so many scenes when the idea was to resurrect The Matrix ?This is a simple money grab and everyone involved in this film should be ashamed.,1
3472,I've always hated Revolutions because both Neo and Trinity died....so depressing. The fact that this movie was all about reuniting the two was awesome. Couldn't be happier with the ending.,9
3473,"Movies are made for profits and not of altruistic reasons to entertain the masses. I still wander to this day about why was this movie even made. I knew It's was going to flop. Why? Matrix trilogy is already perfect.they both dead to stop Mr Smith. The whole ideas is not for 2021. It's for the 90s, ages where things were different &amp; humans were in transitions to new world order &amp; new technology.wakowsky brothers (Now its one lady) have failed every movie they have tried since Matrix and this was a total fail too. I was expecting something new after the machines and humans found a way of coexistence, I was expecting a new enemy/thread that should make them both work together to come through. Imagine Zion humans fighting together along side a cyborg neo, that would be amazing imo. Sadly after watching this ""thing"" I've come to the conclution that shehe was trying to do the first matrix al over again but woke.",2
3474,"This installment of Matrix is, so to say, under the weather, or, more accurately, in tone with the times we live in, for awhile.The characters are bored, older, and bearing the weight of the sense that nothing can make a change anymore. And this is just their life inside the Matrix... A lot of upset viewers compare it to the previous installments - why?! The first Matrix was a revelation, fit for its times... the second one just went deeper into the concept or the mindbending, however you want to call it, while the third both provided a resolution AND took part of its meaning away, making it a bitter victory. That, if you paid attention... Because ""the system only improves with each chosen one that fights the system"" is hardly an optimistic conclusion.Now we have something beyond that, and being an ""eyes wide open"" approach to the entire paradigm, it bears the seed of cynism, skepticism and disappointment. It is also satyrical in places, fuelling the debate whether this installment was forced or the authors wanted to do it, as well as the actors. Youth is far behind, for many involved in this project, people changed. A lot. Same for the viewers. I'm thinking the fans of the Matrix just don't want to confront unpleasant ideas, they expected an escapist 4th movie, in the way an ex rebel young rocker, now with a neat haircut, and being a middle manager in some irrellevant company wants not a loud concert and back pain from standing up in a crowd, but a romanced actualised rock song, to listen to it at home or in a cosy bar. As for the younger viewers, they are brought up in a world that already digested globally ideas like the ones from the initial Matrix movies, nothing new there, no revelation at face view, because the idea is part of the conceptual mix they already lived on, while growing up.So maybe this 4th Matrix has a target public issue. Or maybe it just threw in some quantum computing things that we cannot completely grasp, yet. It remains to be seen. However, most of the takedown comes from different expectations, to which the movie did not answer. And it is most likely a deliberate thing, they just ignored those expectations or went against them, because they wanted to show something else. What, more exactly?! I do not have a clear answer. Put with the other movies, it seems to convey the idea that awakening is not a set thing, nor is it just one big break - more like, after each effort of opening your eyes, one discovers yet another layer of deception. Yet, one has to go on fighting for the existential truth. Why, again? Because this is what it means to be human. Although humans are so tired, this movie says... and almost drifting away from their defining traits and their big existential fight. Only that some awakening triggers have been placed by themselves here and there, to help them get through this flat part of the curve in the process of finding out who we are and what are we meant to do. Something like this...",7
3475,"Ya I uh don't really know what to say .... Did I like it ? Not sure . Did I hate it , not really . The part where they bring trinity back is cool . Don't think I like the matrix anymore and I hope this doesn't ruin Keanu's performance in the next John wick ....",7

3477,"I can't tell you how excited I was to see this movie. I was completely transfixed by the original Matrix trilogy - I even bought the Blinde Design sunglasses from Reloaded, had a chrome Nokia slider (still my favorite phone), and even now, my ringtone is the one used in the original Matrix film. So, in a way I suppose my hopes were a little high, but like everyone else, I was fairly disappointed with Revolutions.I get that they had to update it for a new generation (even I was wondering what kind of cool twist they would put on a smartphone), but they abandoned that facet completely, while never explaining why or how. I get there are no pay phones, but even more than 1999-2003, cell phones are ubiquitous, so it was odd that I guess they just had some sort of ear piece to talk to ""the operator"", and every business still uses landlines.Other things that just didn't sit right were the new Smith (just not menacing or the same charisma of the original; not only recast - and poorly cast at that , but completely rewritten). Not to mention, Neo was supposed to have destroyed him, but it was never explained how he returned.Having Neil Patrick Harris just ruined the tone, and honestly made it kind of humorous - especially given the role he plays. Still not sure why they did what they did with Morpheus - that was never explained either.I get they're trying to retool the franchise for a new generation and they had to find a way to bring back characters they killed off, but there were so many unneeded changes. It just felt like it was someone whom had watched the original films rather than someone who really cared about them. They sleek style of the originals was gone (especially once the characters are 'freed'), the stunning action scenes weren't there - admittedly it's hard to top what they did with the originals. It just needed some refinement and someone telling them when to pull back and when to go further.I still hope there are more Matrix movies (or even a series), but I really hope they're truer to the originals.",7
3478,"I had very low expectations of this since the sequels were so bad, save yourself the time and just watch the first one and forget this tripe exists. Turned it off not half way through, they had it right in the meeting when they said ""Warner Brothers wants a fourth in the franchise and they'll make it even if we're not in on it"". Keanu should've told them to have at it and let a sleeping dog lie. Absolute trash if you're an OG viewer of the original.",1
3479,"I've always thought the matrix series was a bit overrated and this movie didnt do anything to improve my attitude towards it. The story is fine, i like that it focused on neo and trinity, but everything else just seemed like noise. Alot of things were re used as a copy paste from the original which to me felt lazy and unoriginal, and as far as the characters, by the end of the movie i couldnt tell you a single name besides neo and trinity. It may just be me, idk but besides a halfway decent story i didnt see much to this movie.",6
3480,"It's worth watching for the action and is written for the Woke generation which is fine, why the studios continually feel the need to bring back something that was groundbreaking for it's time and re-hash an old story with new sentiments is beyond me, write something new, take the same risks they took when the original was made.It's set for another outing I think which is a shame but the biggest shame is that I will go and spend my money watching the next one, so perhaps I am the problem?If you have a spare couple of hours and want to see some kung fu, special effects and gun fights it's worth while.",6

Not having Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne was a noticeable nagging absence.",7
3484,"Given the almost infinite ways this movie could have played out, they did a reasonable job of the multiple ones they chose to follow!My only real criticism is that they did use multiple yet managed to really ignore a continuation based plot!The special effects are good but sadly, really 'run-of-the-mill' by today's standards, the acting was probably the best of the entire series although the agent Smith was too different whereas the fight scenes were almost identical - something really new might have been a nice touch!Worth watching with low expectations so you are less likely to be disappointed!Synopsis: best acting of the entire series makes it worth a watch, complex and tangential story lines lose something but doesn't demolish the viewing enjoyment enough to suggest it isn't worth nearly two and a half hours of your time!",5
3485,"The movie invites to watch the story until the end. However, the plot is never ending. The picture stuffers the lack of intellectual development. The human protein is a central part of all journeys of the characters framed by ideologies of Christianity, digitalism, transhumanism and etc.The casting department made a great job allowing to attract new faces. There are a lot of interesting things for technician nominations for the award season.A director and writers team failed to develop story and present the valuable narrative. The authors embedded the plot in commonly known patterns of dystopia. Only cast and VFX made a real resurrection of this story.",6
3486,Trilogy was one the best think happened in Hollywood. This is the worst thing happened in matrix itself.Messed up story. They should have left trilogy alone.Strictly a money grabber.,1
3487,I really liked this movie but I think only because I watched the first three back to back and got really invested in the whole matrix story. This included watching the The Second Renaissance from The Animatrix as well. I did feel the story was a little slow but the fact that it was long gave me the feeling nothing was left open. I did feel the fight scenes were a little weak but I thought the story was good. Plus I think they wrapped it up well enough to end the whole story or make another one.,9

What a way to destroy a quality trilogy with some horrid, horrid writing and casting.The end verdict? Save your money. Accept the fact the Wachowski brothers are the only ones capable of making a matrix film without it seeming wayyyy too money orientated.Take the blue bill because you do not want to see how deep this rabbit hole goes.",2
3494,"... so they couldn't haven been met or missed. This movie had a lot to live up to and for me it missed the mark a bit. I will re-watch it but I don't think that's going to help.Technically it was a good watch, the necessary visual effects flowed nicely from the previous films (if not a bit underwhelmingly so at times which was odd). I also felt the story connected well enough with its predecessors tho it wasn't at all what I was/wasn't expecting. I really have two beefs with this film.1. The film was too focussed on the relationship between two characters (almost any film can do this) and wasted the opportunity generated by the first 3 films to explore more ""Matrixy"" concepts; and2. Two key characters deserving of continuity we're not afforded it which in my humble opinion was a terrible shame. I have no issue with any of the new characters but to mess with two of the most memorable characters in the films that brought us all along on the journey to arrive at this fourth was in my view, a mistake.It's certainly left open for another, I'm not sure that'd be a great idea given this most latest instalment. That said, watching The Matrix Resurrections is not a complete waste of two and a half hours.",5
3495,"First of all, the action in this movie goes so very slow. The retrospection for many of the scenes is a good idea. The actors are very well selected, most of them play good, but then the characters are a total stereotype and a cliché, makes them not interesting and significant at all. The plot is simply a twisted cheesy one, relying on posing faces and overexaggerated behavior combined with a stupid ""sci-fi"" terminology, but then you have Neo who became totally inadequate and out of date for the reality and an action that isn't really clear why it happened what it aims, a good representation of my statement is agent Smith. On top of all that, the soundtrack is unimpressive, unlike the older ones and all of this goes for around 130 minutes. Well - no, not a good one, if it isn't for some of the actors, the leftovers from the Matrix and the decent CGI, this movie is 5 stars at best which is a rate for a movie that isn't worth watching. Maybe it's best to leave it where it is, all the good things come to an end and so seems to he The Matrix.",
3496,"I was extremely excited for this one!! Especially since it's the last HBO Max same day as theater movie. After finishing Matrix Resurrection late last night my first thought was did this need to be made?? My answer was......not really. It was fun for sure. Great action and for Keanu and Carrie Ann to be filming these fight scenes in their 50s is stellar. This was not a necessary movie to be made in Hollywood but after reading about why Lana did make it, all of it makes sense and I applaud her for going after it. Was it Great.... No. Was it bad.....No. If you liked Matrix Revolutions then you will like this one. Like I said it's fun and there are a couple of really parts that kept me laughing into the next day.",7
3497,"It is a slap in the face of movie artists. You had everything: a lot of money, a good trama, a good universe, millions of fans, the chance to cast any actor you needed, or at least a bunch of good one, 20 years to write it right, all the time you want to edit this... how can you do such a poor job? This is obviously a matter of ego somewhere between direction and production. Choreography and editing was a bad match. Actors were wrongly instructed. Special effects completely inconsistent, and sometime really poorly made. Neo, which is a semi god, completely a farse. The editing didn't gave the only thing it really matter: the flow of emotions and the timing, important moments were useless, and useless moments too long. What happened here??? Somebody should take the blame of making such a waste of money. With all the people who struggle to barely survive on this planet, you have to tell me how you can spend 180 millions on a movie like this one.You should take the story and do it again completely from scratch as an animated movie. With an other director, an other cast, an other production. Just to save the fans from the delusion.",4
3498,I see there are a few poor reviews but those reviews are from people who never believed in the original Matrix message or are too young to have appreciated the message. The movies were always focused on the ultimate question we must all ask ourselves. What is more important to you? Freedom or safety and comfort? This movie asks the same question and Neo and Trinity welcome a new opportunity to fight for freedom. The Matrix is more sophisticated in this move and Lana Wachowski brought along a number of cast members from Sense 8 which was a pleasant surprise. They did a great job aging Jada Smith so she could be Niobe again and making her the establishment character who prefers peace and comfort to freedom. To her it is fine that most of humanity will never know the tiny space of peace and freedom she enjoys. I'm impressed with everything about how the movie was written and presented. There's a new Morpheus and Smith but it all flows well. They left it so that other movies might be made or not. Either way I'm satisfied that the Matrix franchise maintained its integrity. Bravo!,8
3499,It's genially!!! Go and watch!!! And it's just in tame and again against our matrix!The beginning is a mirror of really of our wold. Than Lana broke this new version of matrix again.This film makes be believe in healthy future!,10
3500,"Many years ago I saw a first movie, innovative like Inception or Alita, Spider-Man in the Multiverse...New moves, new frames, good wardrobe, so I waited.The Resurrection was the best of the Triumvirate.Real good sci-fi cinema, like James Cameron, Guillermo del Toro or the percursors Lucas/Spielberg.The sisters/brothers have Cloud Atlas, wow, real kick in spotlight of good cinema.Now, they want us to say that they are underachieving.They mounted a pseudo sequel without any real grip.Are they still available?They could extract a whole new ""fork"" at any given point of the prior movie experience and, as a blessing of creativity, give us an entire new Arc of the Matrix, or a parallel one.Instead they reinstated the same characters into less bright, minor innovation, cliches, until we,I, not being real, must tread softly, but I don't believe they were afraid that someone would smash or scatter their dreams.Why?As proven, there were no dreams required, only script adaptation, like a minor update, fixing bugs, introducing some minor functionality...Seven stars for the privilege of doubt, maybe there is another that brings light into this unsatisfactory piece.Go there, ask for new ideas, red blood.Wich does not mean that you were not doing well, Cast &amp; Crew: congrats and many thanks, old friends... Keep it coming, and coming 🙏",7
3501,"Lana Wachowski failed to capture the magic of the Matrix that the Wachowski brothers created. The story is self aware that it's being forced by WB to pump out another movie. It is more of a jab at studios than a proper 4th installment of the series. The movie had too much member berries and not enough actual story and direction. The action shots were so zoomed in that it didn't feel like I was watching a Matrix movie, you couldn't see the fluid movements.",5
3502,"The Wachowskis made a masterpiece with the original matrix and everything that has followed has been utter garbage. Too much thinking done in the writer's room to make the sequels more intelligent and in this case meta. What they have failed to realise is that the reason why the first movie was so good was because it was original, simple, and everyone that watched the movie connected with it. I remember coming out of the cinema and doubting if I live in the Matrix or the real world. The sequels never made the audience feel that awe again. It was all about psuedo intelligent conversations and mind numbing action. This is the reason why none of the sequels ever lived up to the original.",1
3503,"Amazing movie, telling a story as old as life itself . This is a love story ❤, a story about humanity and the oneness of humanity ❤.I understand why the fans of the trilogy are having such a different reaction they had expectations, they where hoping for a 4th matrix movie like the trilogy.This is a stand alone movie and a brilliant one, this movie tells the real story of the real matrix of today's world. It tells the story of Adam and Eve of Shiva and Shakti of the original ,,humans,, the story of God , the Story of creation and the oneness of humanity ❤.God is Adam and Eve , both together ❤ Adam&amp; Eve form God. Both together Neo and Trinity for the ONE , They finally got it .Congratulations 🎊 👏 this story has been told in Hinduism for the past 9000 years and in the Torah, Bible and Quaran for the past 3000 years 👏.It's a story about the reincarnation of Neo&amp;Trinity ( Shiva/Adam and Shakti/ Eve) the story of Gods reincarnations over and over on our beautiful planet all the way till 2022. When Neo meets Trinity in the ,,Matrix,, they just know, that's God love for humanity ❤. That's how God awakens every other time, he meets his Half Trinity and they both awaken and start remembering who they are and their Consciousness is exiting ,,theMatrix ,, . Exiting the Matrix means dissolving your concept of Ego, exiting the 3D vibration and entering into a 5D vibration of pure love ❤ like Neo and Trinity.This movie is a masterpiece 👏 ✨ it was made for the people who had the patience to read what we wrote and actually understood what we said 👏.We love you all , happy journey and stay blessed 🙌 😇 🙏.",10
3504,Liked the movie. Reasons 3 reasons.1) It's a keanu revees movie.2) It's a Keanu revees movie.3) It's a Keanu revees movie.He is back in his old miracle works since his potrayal of John wick in big screen.Though the original 1999 one was better and Matrix reloaded is still the best in the franchise. It's definitely worth a watch because of the actors and to go back in the Matrix..,10
3505,"The matrix was a one of a kind game changer that can never be duplicated. How can you expect anything to come close?It would have been easier to play it safe and follow the exact same processes as before, but they didn't. Of course they used some of the same old tricks, but the story was more unique than I expected.I expected to be more disappointed about the Morpheus decision than I was. It actually seemed to work out fine how they connected those dots. There still are lot a of questions hanging that I think will be answered in upcoming films which seem inevitable.Finally, I loved smith and the analyst. They both fit in well while still being slightly different from their predecessors.",7
3506,"No, it's not the most entertaining movie around.Note: The Matrix Resurrections doesn't stand on it's own. It isn't a movie you can watch and follow along perfectly. If you haven't watched movies 1, 2 and 3 then I would suggest you do. The trilogy definitely sets this movie up. The original movies were very entertainment driven on the surface but required reading between the lines. Understanding the intended meaning behind the interactions.If you didn't enjoy the Matrix 1, 2 and 3 for what they were, an intriguing idea with special effects and maximum entertainment value then you probably won't enjoy this movie.I found The Matrix Resurrections a nice little cherry on top of the 3rd movie.A lot of people disliked the 2nd and 3rd movies. Those people will undoubtedly not like the 4th movie.The Matrix Resurrections is most definitely for the fans. I wasn't originally pleased with the way the 2nd and 3rd movies went but a rewatch with the mind of an elder millennial definitely helped to understand the stories and this movie adds onto the trilogy perfectly.There is action, special effects and dialogue.Well worth the watch if you're a matrix fan.Other reviews seem to be from hyperactive, instant gratification viewers who prefer content to smack them in the face.",9
3507,"The plot is simply disgusting. Wachowski made a bet that he could try to squeeze a pension out of his army of fans as his life was drawing to a close, and that bet worked. I was waiting for a good continuation of the Matrix, I was waiting for robots, a city of these very machines. And in the end a lot of chatter.The legendary character Morpheus was turned into a clown, Mirovingen into a bum, I can't say anything about the new ""heroes"" at all, I had no emotional connection to the characters, they are all empty shells without charisma or character. I watched them rape my favorite franchise for 2.5 hours turning it into an incomprehensible mess of a train to pusan, cheap Marvel, repeating half the scenes from the previous parts.The only thing I don't understand is how did Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss agree to be in it??? Why??? This movie doesn't exist for me personally, the matrix ended at part 3, there's nothing to continue, the story is over and it's perfect! To all fans goodness and patience.",1
3508,"Hilarious, self aware from start to finish. A true satire of itself, the film industry and with the occasional nod toward the appropriation of the red pill by various incel and right wing groups. I'd have given it 9 if it wasn't so blindingly obvious at times....especially the final scene which made it even more abundantly clear the analyst represents Lana herself.",8
3509,"Wasted two hours of my life and then I was upset for another two hours for wasting two hours. Truly unwatchable, was skipping throughout.Love Keanu and original Matrix but this is a parody of the film, not a true sequel.",2
3510,There ate things way different maybe the action scenes arent so spectacular and so well coordinated but the story is definitely what you should be hoping for if you know about the story of this universe. It confirms that the Matrix Online is cannon and doesnt close the possibility of another two films and thats really good ! Kudos to Lana which didnt disappoint.,10
3511,"The story actually had great potential, and some of the action sequences are scary good, (the swarm bombs), but too much time and script is spent trying to get the new kids on the block to look cool and forced relevance, relegating the OG characters to something a kin to sidekicks. The Morphius storyline glossed over. The Smith story, glossed over. Moss is fantastic and given more depth which was great, but why bother with the whole role reversal? 3 movies were spent building the story of Neo why piss that away? Did the New Star Wars movies teach you nothing!?! The humour and piss taking was awful and tone deaf! Overall it was an exercise in ticking boxes, making sure everyone had a painfully equal part to play... What a shame. Stinky end to an generation defining movie...",5
3512,"I didn't know what was going on in the movie. I fell asleep twice on it, and almost a third time. Had it not been for my kids keeping me entertained, I definitely would have went to sleep again. This movie is so hard to pay attention to. Nothing that anyone is saying or doing makes sense. So I guess the original trilogy was supposed to be a video game. SMH. This is the last matrix I will see. I don't care how many more they make. Trinity looks like a grandmother that's has kids in their 30s and grandkids in their late teens, early 20s. I couldn't care less about any of the new characters. I couldn't wait for this movie to be over. SUCH A WASTE OF TIME.",3
3513,"I enjoyed this movie. The only thing I would change about it is to slow down and let the concepts breathe a little. Just like the original Matrix films, this movie is packed with ideas and well-developed concepts, but it could have been spread out over 2 films to let the audience grasp the story. It moves fast, the characters talk fast, and it is easy to get lost if you aren't paying close attention to everything.The original Matrix films will always be better, but this movie was good. It has a lot of levity, a lot of the Wachowski's colorful style, and some neat connections to Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. Concepts from the first films were revisited and improved upon. One great thing about this movie is that it doesn't feel like rehashing of the original films, even though there are scenes that mirror the originals very closely.I am surprised that so much new stuff could come out of recycling scenes from the original movies, but somehow Lana Wachowski pulled it off. The door is left wide open for sequels, and I would definitely watch those too. My mind is buzzing with the new material, and I can't wait to see where Lana Wachowski takes it next. 8/10, WILL watch again!",8
3514,"The beginning is extremely confusing and it doesn't really get better, with new elements being thrown in the whole time.The fighting scenes are just awful, resembling nothing like Matrix 1-3. It's as if they forgot how to arrange transitions between scenes, as if lighting totally changes between camera angles, as if Neo hits 3 times slower than before (has he gotten that old ?).And then there's the story line. Is this really the best they could come up with ?No Matrix 5 please. This is starting to look like Star Wars, going downhill further and further.",4
3515,"I am a big fan of Matrix 1999.But that was 22 years ago. The movie style and dialogues are adapted to the new generation. It changed a little bit. What changed the most are the viewers and fans. We (fans from the original) are all older and have a hard time digesting silly scenes, corny and cliche dialogues. So I don't think it's fair to low rate the movie because of that. And our own 22 year older expectations.However the movie does look like a disney movie where only only computer codes and machines die and bad guys have a terrible aim.All in all, is not a bad movie.",7
3516,All these years and all we get is another (worse) version of the the original trilogy. The script was subpar and lazy with all the clips from the past and such little action that everyone wanted.,5
3517,"Only people who have not followed the Matrix though all three episodes could could berate this. Different, difficult, but eventually all comes together.",10
3518,"Super hectic and I wasnt caught up in the storyline. The movie background sound/music is far fetched, doesnt match with the moments. Also there is a new kind of 'sense of humor' that They put in the script.. wich I think doesnt fit the matrix vibe.",3
3519,Any real matrix fan would hate watching or even acknowledging this.It is by far one of the stupidest sequels to a masterpiece of a trilogy.DON'T RUIN IT FOR YOURSELFDON'T WATCH.,1
3520,Is all spider man fanz. REVIEWmatrix 4 is goodddddddddddd.White Rabbit was perfect to hear in this and I don't understand this was everything I would've wanted!Thoroughly straight forward enjoyable movie.Carrie-Anne Moss is back.,10
3521,"When I first started the movie, it seemed very similar to the original Matrix. There are elements of amnesia and learning about what the Matrix is all over again. Morpheus was also replaced with someone else entirely, which has a luke warm feeling to it.. To sum this movie up. I would say it doesn't do justice to the Matrix series. Instead it reuses the story and plays clips from the old movie throughout while trying to set a new story; which is not all that interesting. Also the movie oddly broke the 4th wall in a bland sort of way, even talked about the Matrix 4 within the film, and WB which was a bit weird. This ""movie"" to me is less like a movie and more like a tribute with movie elements... disappointed. But at least they brought the Matrix back; the only selling point. Oh and Keanu Reeves of course.",5
3522,"I'm a big fan of this series. Always have been always will be. It's thought provoking. It's intentional. This movie was extremely Meta. It was irreverent. How else could they have pulled this off? It's been almost 20 years since the 3rd was released. I think they tied this in perfectly. There are shot for shots from the originals and on one hand I could see people not liking that. Personally tho, that's exactly what made this movie phenomenal. This Is a story about destiny and love. I cannot wait to watch it 5 more times and soak in every detail. Go see it and decide for yourself.",10
3523,"I love the original Matrix, and equally love the sequels (minus that dance scene). I really enjoyed everything that was a part of the franchise at its peak. So, it was with some trepidation, and a little bit of hope, that I approached a new Matrix film. I like that they took a different approach to the story. However, it didn't quite work. The writing seemed just a bit weak, and the plot never truly grabbed my interest. Indeed, the often light tone made it difficult to really engage with. Additionally, it never convinced me that anything was really at stake. Where simple but striking characters made an instant impression in the originals, this one had an entirely forgettable cast. This wasn't helped by some of the dialogue being difficult to understand. Unfortunately, the visuals were also surprisingly lacking. Where the originals were notable for a gorgeous comic book inspired visual style, this film has a painfully bland 90s look to it. Equally, where the originals had impressive action that echoed classic martial arts, this film has nothing exciting to offer. The score had the classic sound, and was enjoyable - minus an awful song over the closing credits. I'd like to give this another shot down the line, as it was impossible not to have some sort of expectation prior to the film. However, I have no great expectations of my opinion changing for the better.",4
3524,"I love the first movie. I tried to imagine 2 &amp; 3 never existed. Now I add the 4th one never existed too...Brother/sister Wachowski, please stop making movies.",3
3525,"While splicing in the first Matrix movie is a great refresher course for those who may have forgotten, The Matrix Resurrections' story is a rehashing of the first film, and nothing more. However, when I strip away the story-and the writing makes sense on HOW Neo and Trinity came back-it's a fun, dumb action movie. Some reviewers take things too seriously; stop that. Just watch the movie for what it is and enjoy (if you can).Is it great? No. Is it fun? Sure. Would I recommend this film? If you're a hardcore Matrix fan, probably not. You'll get incensed picking a part the story and pretty much say ""Eff this movie.""",6
3526,"I get some of the hate, but this movie is totally watchable. I give it a 7 because it's premise is witty, and while the movie won't provoke a laugh, it has plenty of tongue in cheek moments that you can't help but smile over. It's very original. This movie feels like a Matrix film. It's a little slow and long but never not entertaining. If it were cringe it'd be terrible 3/10, but it's not, it's honest with itself and original.",7
3527,"When I heard about Matrix 4 I was sceptical. We all know that sequels in their majority are dumb and were created only to earn money, which is in itself not bad for producers but bad for us, viewers.Matrix 4 delivers. Clever re-imagination of original story with modern tweaks that look authentic. Frankly, I re-watched Matrix 2 in the evening after Matrix 4 and must admit - new Matrix is a light years better.Emotionally moving, good action and humour that was absent in previous parts.Not ideal but definitely a pleasant surprise.8/10.",10
3528,"As a super Matrix fan, I almost couldn't be more satisfied. Being open minded of what it must take to make a 'follow up' for a brand such as the Matrix, I do not understand what the low rated reviews are coming from, I felt it payed respect to the first Matrix trilogy plus added some more. Absolutely thought trough and deep. Movies like these are rare these days! I had my mind blown away several times leaving me with the feeling that I will definitely see this movie again.... And again.. and probably again and again! Absolutely loved it!",10
3529,"I watched all the originals when they were released. This chapter fits well as a continuation of the original storyline, including further development of the conceptual scifi aspect. Resurrections is equal in its execution, and is far superior in its settings, special effects and development of the mythology. The supporting cast are deep and fabulous. Keanu Reeves chose to underplay vs. Overplay his character, and it worked beautifully. Bugs emerges as a significant new protagonist. I'd love to see more of her in this role. I literally loved every minute. A complete success in my judgement.",10
3530,"It's not revolutionary with visual effects that are on pare with any netflix show today but definitly under Dune quality by 2021 cinema standards it looks very visually cheap put together. Action was very poorly done. This could have worked as a Netflix show pretty much. To much humor that doesn't work. So new version of matrix with another program controlling it from what I could read most people didn't really understood the movie.So machines managed to salvage Neo and placing him in believing nothing he experience before actually matters and that he invented the matrix game and so on. So he goes to therapy to get brainwashed. Which is not true of course all films did actually happen and as he gets to know that later but the movie drags this whole story to long and to much that it actually becomes pointless. So they unplug him from matrix again. The machines battle with other machines for limited resources ( which I loved so much) There was so many cool ideas here that could have been explored. The movie was put together to fast so it got lost in translation I think. Trinity was always Neos drive force even from first movie in here they become each others drive force how cute. The ideas that old code coming into new matrix seams to have like Admin privilages was intetesting. Which you could see also, the idea that there were several layers of matrix which one version Neo made to simulate Morpheus shadow or digital imagination copy. What happened to real Morpheos? They left to many things unfinished here and it just becomes a mess. I do agree it's a bit to long. And they should have started the movie when Neo wakes up it would probably been much better movie.",5
3531,"Great, absolutely fantastic,story,actors,this is the sequel of the famous franchise people want to see. Almost perfectly made,love it. I could watch more of it, honestly. Big thanks too actors and person who made this movie.",10
3532,"Watching this, I tried to remind myself of when Hollywood last made something new that blew people away visually and stylistically. Iron man? Avatar? Maybe Inception? These last 10 years feels like a constant barrage of remakes and sequels of already popular titles, mostly made by people who seem to not really understand or care why the original worked.Enter The Matrix 4, a sequel to a trilogy where even the second and third installments failed to live up to the first one. I went in with pretty low expectations, having already seen some of the reviews, but it somehow struggled to live up even to them. I had seen some rants about how it was yet another victim of woke culture, possibly because one of the main characters is a young blue-haired woman, just like the memes, but I didn't think it leaned too much in that direction. It was just boring.The problem is the same as in many new remakes, reimaginings and sequels. They get most of the surface-level stuff correct, as in it looks kind of like a Matrix movie, but they fail to give us characters that we actually care about and feel invested in. And without that nothing that happens have any impact. The only ones that we have some interest in are Neo and Trinity, but that is because we already know them from the previous movies, very little is made in this one to develop them further, and I hate to say it but Keanu's wooden acting doesn't exactly draw you in. Some other characters show up that we know but with new faces and acting so differently that they might just as well be new characters. And then there is a bunch of totally new ones that have so little personality and character development that they might as well have been made out of cardboard.The original Matrix had a very clear hero's journey as a stable backbone of a very strange new world, filled with new ideas and concepts for the audience to grapple with. It also hade two, for the time, unique ingredients. The first was the very obvious visual style with the slow-mo bullet time that had never been done before that spawned numerous imitations. The other was taking normal actors, not the usual well defined Hollywood action heroes, and have them do very demanding kung-fu. I remember seeing the behind the scenes clips describing how hard they had to train for months just to be able to do the action scenes, and how they had help from veterans from the asian movie industry to get the choreography right.Both Keanu and Carrie-Anne are now 20 years older, and it shows. They might look good for people of their age, but it is very obvious that they no longer can do the stunts. I don't blame them for that, but it means that the fight scenes are very slow and full och cuts to try and speed them up. It also means that the movie is mostly talking, and when it is time for the big action packed ending it's just Neo holding up his hands to project a shield to stop bullets with a bunch of explosions all around to make it exciting.As a result, there is nothing new here. Everything feels like a lesser imitation of the previous movies. In fact, the first third tries so hard to bank on the nostalgia that it straight up shows clips from the original trilogy or just re-creates famous scenes. It actually feelt like a parody at first, with poor attempts at humor, self-reference and 4th-wall breaking. At one point you have a bunch of ""creatives"" brainstorming ideas for a fourth installment, and all I could think of was that this must have been almost word for word how the actual makers of the movie came up with their ideas.Also, I have to mention one of the ridiculous things said by the main villain. In his big speach explaining the plot to the viewer he describes how he has taken one of Neo's powers and uses it against him, and that that power is bullet time. Sure, Neo could stop bullets, but bullet time in itself was never his power, manipulating the Matrix was. It was just a cool visual effect used by the film makers that got the name bullet time in the real world. Having it referenced here as an actual power just illustrated how little the makers of this movie cared to understand the original.",4
3533,Macron as been hired as the new Mr. Smith in this new ChapterIt's an obvious glitch in the Matrix!It's the new tendencies this fall for biggest blockbusters to be based on previous installments nostalgia.,5
3534,"The Matrix gave me this perception when I first watched it. I saw the information from religious books that 'our world is not Real', through the Matrix and technology. It was really impressive.However, the actors were terrible in Matrix 4. Especially the analyst was very bad. It was like he was not like a man. It could have been better if he was a woman. Agent smith was very bad. I didn't like it. As if he was one.The movie could have been better. Trinity could have been more beautiful with make up.I didn't like the girl with the dyed hair, maybe in real life, but not in the Matrix movie.But I think someone wanted to spoil the matrix movie with this last movie.",1
3535,"Guys this is isn't the 90s. Matrix was already invented. So this film pays a sincere celebration of what it was the first one. A continuation of the same feeling, the same suspense and the great old characters. It's not a revolution. It's not a masterpiece but it is a totally good sequel. Matrix was so revolutionary that is impossible to achieve the same feeling.",8
3536,"Apparently the entire Matrix series wasn't about Neo, it wasn't about choice, it wasn't about free will or Descartes or the nature of reality. It was about Trinity getting overshadowed by Neo and held back by all the oppressive male forces.They turned Trinity into a worse Mary Sue than Rey. Neo struggles through the entire film, trying to remember who he really is and regain half his abilities. Trinity becomes the new female The One in about 5 minutes. Clearly the one thing that hasn't changed in twenty years is that the Wackowskis still can't write an ending.",1
3537,"If you are a true fan of the franchise, then you will love this film. It looks stunning, glossy, colourful and plays cleverly with the narrative of the original trilogy and it's place in the minds of the characters in this new Matrix.I'm glad I read the interview with Lana Wachowski explaining where this story came from and the reason she revisited this universe. Knowing her reasons allows you to experience the story differently, as a beautiful love story of characters that are so obviously important to her.I was also impressed/relieved with how the resurrections are explained - even though this is Sci-fi, it made sense and not too far-fetched. Very clever stitching of the bridge between the original 3 films and this new story. Nothing is erased or apologised for, which is awesome and full of integrity.Give it a chance.",10
3538,"I have never seen a remake that look exactly like a rerun.This isnt a sequel, its the same movie, with some different actors thrown in. How they got Carry Ann and Keanu to do this?Do yourself a favor,Just watch the original instead.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",3
3539,"Definitely for a Matrix fan, a huge let down. Come on! Good machines working on humans side!Duh!!, who is going to buy that after all that trilogy. May be an OKISH!!! Treat for someone who is not a matrix fan franchise, yet have heard about it. But I guess they are rare.Such a waste of an opportunity!!!",7
3540,"No Hugo, No Laurence, No architect, No oracle? I had a way better script in my head than what this random flick gave me. I need a time machine to go back to where this movie does not exist. Nothing else to say.",3
3541,What a climax man.It is such a great movie seeing trinity and neo the golden duo such a pleasure to me.I loved everyhting about the movie all the vfx fightings storyline loved it.,10
3542,"Now on it's own this movie would be fairly watchable, thus the 5. But all of the dystopian feel, the seriousness and danger, the intensity of ""risking everything"" to really be free to the intricate but genius plot, is gone. I realise they wanted to portray a different, post ""The One"" Matrix, but all down to the color scheme this felt like a joke. Filled with the kind of one liners you could come across in parodies or (done well) in the likes of the Fifth Element, here they just don't work. My biggest disappointment was what they did to the characters of Morpheus and agent Smith. Both of them have exuded a calmness and authority that made one respect and fear them, a mysterious aura that made you want to know more about them. Both were basically shaven down to a joke. Neil Patrick Harris can absolutely act, but here his character definitely could not transmit what it was supposed to. He just felt like a villain from the not-so-good Batman movies. When the banished characters attacked I actually rolled my eyes.Saying this, in true Matrix style the action scenes were of course well made, the visuals in general were great. Keanu's and Carrie-Ann's chemistry is still there. Also have to give a shout out to the great soundtrack. My conclusion: fairly Now on it's own this movie would be fairly watchable, thus the 5.

3543,I will never ever be able to watch The Matrix again. A once unbelievable movie and a great story reduced to some woke mishmash. And this ending! I'm still not sure if I saw the real finale or a parody. Another one bites the dust...,1
3544,"The movie has successfully revived the matrix franchise and I'm excited to see more installments for the future.There's some people who appreciate the first movie and only want so much from the matrix.This has been the case since the trilogy.So it's expected that there will simply be people who will inevitably dislike this movie.The movie was never going to be a remake of the first one.It was always going to expand off the franchise and the matrix lore.You can watch the first one and forget about everything that follows, but personally for me I like the matrix lore and everything the wachowskis have delivered.Ultimately the biggest thing about the matrix has been about love.I think some people overlook that and get caught up in all the other things that come with the matrix.It's always been about neos connection with trinity and nothing getting in the way of love even if the choices are immoral.This movie reinforces that connection between neo and trinity.There is no chosen one. If you want to believe this theory then watch the first movie and don't watch any of the other films.Neo has done good for mankind and AI in the past and has played a vital role, but other characters have also played an important part.In what neo has achieved before, was simply a gateway to others understanding their own potential.To avoid spoiling the movie, Lana has done well to bring Neo and Trinity back to life and Reboot the franchise.Neil Patrick Harris is also a good addition and plays a very good clever role that only him can pull off so well.There is some seriousness and humour that takes the edge off, which I find works well.At the beginning of the film it really makes you think about how much control you have with reality.This relates so much to modern times.We are spoon fed things in which we are told to be right and we go along with it with no questions asked because we are so naive to think otherwise.If we step out of line and go against the grain we are seen as crazy.We follow others rather than follow our own instincts because we don't want to be in the minority.What this movie teaches me is that you should be who you truly want to be and not be trapped into being someone who you aren't.",10
3545,"Lena Wachowski please gives us inspiration about this new Matrix movie, However the matrix stand of the greatest action pack sci-fi movies made leaving this Matrix movie a question mark.... many questioneto be answered, especially as to how Morephus died....yet this film is willed with twists and action.....I give 8/10.",8
3546,"I think they did a Great Job, Great explanation how they got to where they are. So storyline made sense. It was like seeing good old friends as soon as Keanu and Carrie-Anne were on screen. A good balance of suspense, humor, sarcasm and bunch of new concepts and ideas, which can be used for further continuation of the franchise. The CGI and special effects were well done, they look upgraded but also felt familiair with previous movies. The dialogues were well written and flowed surprisingly well. All in all it was a good fun ride and a welcome treat! It was like seeing good old friends as soon as Keanu and Carrie-Anne were on screen.

3547,Destroying whole Matrix franchise with this crap. Do not waste your time going to see this!!!!!!!! This is not matrix anymore and they have 0 new ideas and whole matrox story is destroy. If you like matrix do not watch!!!!!!,1
3548,"The matrix resurrections aka the matrix 4. I went into this with mixed feelings, i just rewatched the original trilogy before finally sitting down to give this one a watch.I for the most part was pleasantly surprised by the movie and enjoyed it quite a bit. There were a few slightly odd moments that weren't properly explained or where hashed over a bit but all in all the storyline and continuation from the original movies was pretty well done and definitely enjoyable.The movie was so good and I personally enjoyed it so much that I would have rated it a 9/10. However and here is my biggest gripes with the film. They resurrected characters like Smith and while not really making the most logic I was still fine with seeing him back on the big screen. However what I wasn't alright with was him being recast.Seeing both Smith and Morpheus being played by different actors really just messed up the movie for me. The actors in question did a okay job but seeing this new guy trying to put on the same mannerisms and characteristics as Smith was just down right wrong. Same goes for Morpheus.It was weird and I for one did not like what they did in recasting two such iconic characters of the matrix. This was the biggest and one of the only real issues I had with this movie though. Everything else worked pretty well for me and I was willing to except whatever explanations were given for it.Anyway 7/10 from me, I can't in good faith give this movie any higher. No offense to the actors who took over for Morpheus and Smith but you can't just step into those shoes. Laurence Fishburne will always be Morpheus and Smith will always be Hugo Weaving.",7
3549,"One of the worst, poorly written and made sequel I have ever seen. Very disappointing. Big Matrix fan of the originals so I was excited to hear of part 4 being released.",3
3550,"I do not deny that the film is original, and not just a soft reboot. But on what cost? I saw people in the cinema who stand up and walked out during the film. I never saw such that. The film gave us the answer if we need new matrix movie. The answer is no. Based on the trailer everybody has expected for some serious movie, that is the reason why it felt like a kicking a ball. I wish i could simply say that it was a bad movie but i can't. It is something different and i was not ready for it. It was like to watch the scarry movie, like it would be a real scream movie. I wish i would take the blue pill.",3
3551,"It is almost impossible a task to make a follow up on the Matrix saga. In this movie they succeeded very well with that i.e the storyline, as well as with the cast, concept and what not else. I was very happy watching it!",10
3552,Very average film that doesn't follow on particularly well from the previous ones. It's much more of a love story than a matrix film.My advice would be give it a miss.,5
3553,"So...yeah. Save yourself the money of watching this. It finds excuses to repeat shot for shot scenes from the other movies. When it's not just playing back literal recording of the old ones. This is really bad.Then there's missing key actors that seemed to have better things to do, such as Lawrence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith). They recasted to some generic actors, don't take me wrong, they do a decent job...But doesn't wash the bad mouth taste of having a familiar face replaced by some other random one with a super weak excuse.To top it off, I'm here sitting wondering if Hans Zimmer will get any cent from the blatant rip-off of his Mind Heist track (from Inception) during the heist/rescue sequence on this movie.",2
3554,"Had seen no trailers , i no idea, went in with an open mind.. like a real matrix lover and under-stander should.. Loved loved loved it... the story, the twists, the mind boggaling turns.. it took me back into the Matrix but a litte deeper. You must be willing to travel and understand what this is about. Sharp as a knive and a stand alione paradox..is it a loop can it be reached .. wow ( mind blowing) basically.. if you didnt like it.. you didnt get it.. or just not ready yet.. but like the loop showed.. time will tell .. i iwish you the best.",10
3555,"Really good start, but things really go to hell down the road...As much as I love Keanu, he didn't live up to the Neo character, it seemed like he got stuck in John Wick character...I honestly have no idea how Jonathan Groff (Smith) even managed to get this role. Instead of an arch enemy, he acts as Neo is his ex-boyfriend and he's trying to get him back by pretending he's mad at him, but flirts with him instead... His outerwear is definitely not helping him fit into the character since he looks like a Wall street banker rather than over-powered super villain rouge agent.Neil Patrick Harris is always a person who's good to see on the screen, but I simply couldn't take him seriously in the role of evil program who controls the entire Matrix...Jessica Henwick (Bugs) gave the best performance by my opinion, but a lot of scenes were just really badly directed...Music didn't fit almost any scene, we all remember Matrix by epic scenes followed by thrilling music, but I guess they were just like ,, NOPE! Fight scene? Here's some calming music... ''Overall, huge disappointment especially since I was waiting for it to come out for over 6 months...",4
3556,"Every motion picture is basically two things. First, the story it wants to tell us. Second, the shape it chooses for that story. The visual effects here may be good, but ""The Matrix Resurrections"" cannot rival any of the three before it, let alone outshine them. The fourth ""Matrix"" movie has good effects, but they don't break any new ground, and whoever has seen many such movies already, will easily tell there's a lot of computer generated imagery here. It looks good, but you can tell it's CGI.On with the visuals then, and if there's anything in this movie that deserves all the praise one can be generous enough to give it, it is the way colors are handled in the frame. Rich, bright and vivid colors look good, and in line with the idea of this virtual reality being too beautiful to be real.There is, however, a thing ""blockbuster"" movies keep getting wrong in the early twenty-first century. And that thing is light. In ""The Matrix Resurrections"" you'll see the Sun a lot, and many other sources of painfully bright light, because the movie will never cease to throw them in your face. Some blame J. J. Abrams and his ""Star Trek"" for this ""trend"". Anyway, placing someone between the camera and the source of bright light is not a good idea, because you end up looking at a couple of big dark figures and a wall of bright nothingness. When used little and for a good reason, this might mean something, when used all over the place, not so much. Apparently, though, some believe it is very stylish. Maybe someday two and a half hours of black screen with some loud Hans Zimmer music will be considered genius.Speaking of the music and sounds in general, they, at least, weren't annoying. And the song from the first trailer is featured in the movie itself. And it combines nicely with the visual sequences that take place within the playing time, almost making it seem like a music video with a little story to tell you. That was nice.Anyway, good visual effects, great colors, descent sound and unnecessary overuse of light tricks is the shape ""The Matrix Resurrections"" has to offer. And, on the whole, it surely isn't bad. But what is underneath all of that?This movie pretty much is to ""Matrix"" what ""The Force Awakens"" was to ""Star Wars"", only with less mystery and less disrespect for the past. Also, it is to ""Matrix"" what ""Terminator: Genisys"" was to ""Terminator"", only not as entertaining and heroic, and more pretentious, which isn't a compliment.The first three movies were made because there was a big story somebody wanted to tell us. The fourth movie was made because a fourth movie had to be made, whether the big picture needed it or not. It is complicated and requires a lot of explanation, which it tries to accomplish with dialogue. It can be boring and annoying, when used a lot. ""Resurrections"" does not add much significance to the franchise, what it can add is confusion and indifference. Did I love it? No. Did I hate it? No. It isn't bad, nor is it good, it simply is unnecessary.",5
3557,"Early in the movie one of the game developers calls it a ""regurgitation"". They summed up their own movie themselves with this one word.Hollywood's current meta is called ""Deconstruction"". But this just usually means giving the finger to what went before. And no, it's not fresh, it was born rotten.",3
3558,"I saw The Matrix Resurrections on February 2nd, and man it was like yesterday never happened.I liked this movie. It became clear from the very beginning that the film's producers were not taking themselves too seriously; which honestly, was the only way it could have been done. I found it to be campy fun mixed with great acting from everyone. Keanu Reeves plays a tortured soul and pulls it off with believable panache.This film borrows heavily from the original trilogy, also from other films such as Tron Legacy, eXistenZ, Vanilla Sky, Total Recall, et al. The action scenes are interspersed with with a lot of talking, as if the extra back story is supposed to make you feel invested in a Matrix reboot, but hey, somewhere it all makes sense.The film's narrative does fall into semi-solipsism at times, but then well balanced with witty self-referential humor. It's cleverness however, will go over most movie-goers heads ~ but I believe that was the intention. The fourth wall winks are there for sure (hence the title of my review).I recommend The Matrix Resurrections; but please take my recommendation with a grain of salt because I also liked other ""4th"" films in a franchise: Terminator Salvation, The Bourne Legacy and yes even Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (don't come at me haters).",7
3559,"Did I enjoy the movie? Yes. The nostalgia factor had me fully manipulated and drawn.Was this edition to the franchise necessary? I don't believe so, at least not this very edition.There seems to be something that's missing and I can't quite figure it out. I feel like this movie could've been written better. The ingredients are there, just not the execution.",6
3560,"Just barely watchable. Reeks of a group of 60 year old men throwing millions into a project to make disconnected vignettes of what they think would be ""cool"" and ""awesome"". The 90s called, they want their kung-fu and slow-mo bullets back. I felt like there should be a black cat walking past, as we've seen it all before.",3
3561,"Anybody who's whining about this movie being a disappointment clearly has rose tinted glasses on. The original Matrix was a true masterpiece in every regard. The following two unplanned sequels, not so much.This new entry is certainly better than the second and third installment. It also opens the door to a new trilogy, and I am ready for that.If your expectations aren't excessive, you'll enjoy this. No, it's not as good as the original, but neither were the other two entries in the original trilogy.",7
3562,"The fight scenes are way too artistically indifferent and none of them stays with you for years after as the ones from the first trilogy. Also the whole aesthetic was so radically changed that it doesn't even feel like Matrix. Where is that green hue that defined the scenes within the Matrix? Also why couldn't Neo fly. He was even more powerful in the first dojo scene but for some reason he couldn't fly this time but needed Trinity for that? Also Agent Smith who was fighting him at first at a comparable speed all of a sudden he can move at bullet time just like the Analyst? And for some reason we give up to the whole idea/mythology of the One that was built within three movies and that -yes indeed- needed Trinity's love to step up, only to see now that Trinity is now is equal to him? That's got to be called a mess guys...",5
3563,Excellent coda to the previous films and sort of makes up for the over-wordy pontifications of the Architect in eps 2 and 3! Neil Patrick Harris is great!! Keanu and Carrie-Anne Moss are fabulous!,9
3564,"Well written, you could tell there been a lot of thought behind it. Love that Neil Patrick Harris was brought in he played his part perfect. When trinity shouts Neo it gave me chills. The only down side. Wasn't keen on smith didn't feel right. His screen time was pretty small can't see how schedule conflict would of been that bad if an issue with the original actor who played smith. Hopefully there another movie and he comes back because his screen presence is powerful! Great movie!",8
3565,"No spoilers.7.5/10 if not for impotent NeoThe look they cast on capitalism and how it reflects matrix in real life is great, the psyche aspect of people being sheep trapped in the system is also true.The action is okish, but repeatable, no imagination. Too many nerds and nerd terms first half of the movie was very cringe. The real issue is they used very little cgi and low budget combined with budget emo actors to deliver a rollercoaster with no apparent point or end. Looks to me there will be Matrix 5 involved.Also, everything in this movie is just trailer for their game ;)6 /10 watchable but cringe for so many reasons.. The movie is for kids, previous installations had that dark grit that rocked, this is all rainbows, butterflies and happiness.. a bit too much influence from the changes watchowski themselves went through wrongly ended up involving with the project that could had been much better.Change is not always good. This deserved better than to become a flick.",6
3566,"The Matrix films were always more than sci-fi. They are quite clearly a hard-hitting commentary on our society, and how everyone is enslaved to a sort of matrix that our leaders have set for us. This entry continues this social commentary, adjusting interestingly to the modern period, with a number of allusions to current culture (digital addiction, third gender, consumerism, etc).The first thing I (and everyone) worried about is how they would continue the story of the original trilogy. It just didn't make sense for me to follow up with a fourth film, except with a bad story. I'm happy to say that the film succeeds in making the scenario make sense. This is a ""new matrix"" with new parameters, and somehow Neo &amp; Trinity are in it and not dead.You thus have a good scenario that works well, and a solid cast with a memorable Keanu Reeves, Carrie Anne Moss, but also the rest of the cast which is good. The new Agent Smith is particularly good, in addition to ""Bugs"", a new character. You also have a quite good villainous figure. Just seeing Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann, who are as strong on screen as ever (as if they didn't age), makes the film worth it.I also very much liked the tropes used in this film, such as the psychologist, and basically the idea that someone is telling you that ""everything is fine"" and ""just take the happy pill"". I'm sure many can relate in real life.Now onto the negatives I can identify:1. Laurence Fishburne is absent and Morpheus has been re-cast. A real shame because he was a necessary memorable character in the Matrix. His absence is explained well, but it still hurts not to see him, when Keanu and Carrie-Anne are there.2. The art-style and color-palette of the Matrix. Maybe they are making a point about this iteration of the matrix being different. The original Matrix films had this dark cyberpunk neutral tone color, quite de-humanising in a dry corporate office kind of way, but very realistic. ""Fight Club"" and many 90s/00s films had this color palette. The New Matrix has a very SGI, colorful color palette, that isn't nearly as visceral and real as the original.3. The fight scenes in the original Matrix films were always so real and visceral. The atmosphere so tense and thriller-like. In this film, although some fight scenes are good, it's nowhere near on the same level as the original films, especially the first Matrix film.Conclusion: This is a solid effort by the Wachowskis. It's nowhere as culturally significant and game-changing as the original 1999 Matrix film due to some design changes and (maybe) a lower budget. However, it is a strong start to what I hope is a sequel trilogy. I very much appreciate the Matrix films for their social commentary above all, and would love to see the future of this iteration of the Matrix and how it unfolds.",7
3567,"I loved it, not sure I could have done any better it was so meta my brain was melting which is what I wanted from a matrix movie. There was some moments that could have been omitted but I still think the movie deserves better than what people are saying. All the questions about what has happened since the matrix revolutions was answered and answered pretty directly.",10
3568,"I remember when my mom introduced me to the first Matrix movie, I was instantly sucked into the Wachowski Sisters' futuristic world. Bombarded by Sci-Fi extravaganza and out-of-this-world action-packed choreography and computer graphics beyond its time, my eyes couldn't leave the screen. I knew this was one of those movies where I would return regularly.This movie is one of those blockbusters where I would watch it either alone or with friends every few years. But as I grew older, I started having a different interpretation of the movie. I realized that the actions were only sugarcoating to capture viewers' attention. The real meaning lay beyond the action sequence. When you look deeper into the movie, you realize that it is a movie about spirituality. A movie about the desire for transformation. A movie about finding your true purpose.When the 4th movie was announced, I remember some of my friends saying, ""They should have ended with the trilogy; now they are turning the matrix into one of those franchises where they milk money out of viewers' pockets."" Back then, I wasn't quite satisfied by how the sequels turned out, but I was glad that they gave it a conclusion instead of generating a never-ending money grab.After walking out of the cinema today, I am glad to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie (The first Matrix will always be the best), even more so with some of the hidden subliminal messages that reflect the world we live in today - hint hint (Metverse?) A lot of viewers would probably just see this as another Hollywood blockbuster action flick. Look deeper, and you will realize that it is not much different from the world we live in.Our main character Neo played by Keanu Reeves or now back in the Matrix as Mr. Anderson as a game designer, where he creates videogames about the Matrix Trilogy to enslave people around the globe in its own virtual world (Complicated right?), but he soon realizes something is off when he starts to see through the Matrix glitches when his boss asks him to make a Matrix 4 videogame. Battling to understand if the world he lives in is real, he once again has to follow the white rabbit and discover the truth behind what is happening.This loud uproarious action-packed mind-bending addition to the series has a lot of great exceptional things to offer, bringing back all those nostalgic moments of the first film. Throughout the first hour of the movie, as we watch Mr. Anderson get sucked back into the Matrix. I can't help but feel satisfied watching Action Choregrpaher Yuen Woo-ping (who brought us some of the best martial art movies of all time E.g. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Kill Bill) choreograph the fight scenes, adding another layer of punch to every action setpiece. We also get introduced to new characters such as Bugs, played by Jennifer Henwick, and also Morpheus, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. The film does a great job in allowing the new character edition to shine while also allowing our main hero in the film to radiate. The charisma of the unique characters helps propel its storytelling forward.The first segment of the movie was so compelling to watch with heart-pounding scenes and psychedelic computer graphic imagery that will cause you to grip the edge of your cinema seat. Unfortunately, the second segment couldn't quite hold up to the hype from the first portion as we watch Neo return to the real world. With a sudden abrupt cut from a rollercoaster thrill ride, we are suddenly thrown a bunch of narration from characters explaining what happened to their world after the Matrix Revolution, which didn't quite fit the film's tone. From a rambunctious buildup, it all suddenly turns quiet but not in a way that compels viewers to learn and understand more about what happened while Neo was gone. There were a few shots of the now newly rebuilt world they live in but instead, they decided to focus on exposition that is not too compelling. I was hoping to see how the world has evolved visually, not just through vacillating dialogues to propel the story.Don't worry, the last segment picks up tremendously as Neo has to venture back into the Matrix to save Trinity - Played by none other than Carrie Anne-Moss. The final part of the movie touches on one of the things I love most about the movie. Love. Love can conquer anything, and that if you are meant to be together, the universe will do anything to get you back into each other's arms. Throughout the movie, the word ""Fear"" is brought up quite a few times; Neo kept saying he was afraid. But when the movie's final segment arrives, he finally realizes that there is nothing more potent than love. Love is the most powerful weapon anyone can have. If you let it guide you, you can do anything and achieve everything.Matrix Resurrection might not be the best of the series, but it did fill a hole in me that the trilogy couldn't. Will there be a Matrix 5? God, I hope not. I think this is the conclusion it deserves, but you never know with the series' success; they might try to push another trilogy forward.Life is beautiful, although sometimes we may feel like we are stuck in a vicious cycle, like a slave working 9 to 5 every day. Just like Mr. Anderson in the Matrix, a lot of us are afraid to venture out of our comfort zone (including me sometimes). We, as homo sapiens, always feel safer with what we have in our vicinity. It is part of our nature brought down from our ancestors. But is this really what we want, though? The Matrix challenges that. Do you want to live like this for the rest of your life? Or do you want to take the red pill? Be adventurous, be brave, conquer the world with love, and let the universe guide you and allow you to see through the Matrix. The choice is yours.8.5/10This will probably be the last film I watch this year in cinema, and I am glad I finished my year with the Matrix Resurrection. I hope everyone has an amazing year ahead and that you make the best out of the remaining two days. Let go of fear and let love guide you. Peace.May everyone have a great New Year :)12/30/2021The Matrix Resurrection, now showing in cinemas.",8
3569,"It feels and looks like matrix which is great.Music is good.New story is intriguing, with nice ideas.Old cast are all great, new cast Bugs is really good, shes really good.Only negative, Bugs crew on this ship is a bit weak acting wise.I loved Matrix in 1999, as a 19 year old programming student it was awesome :)A film can't recreate our youth, or the first time we saw something amazing (matrix). This is a good addition, that's a modern matrix with all the right hooks :) Well done!",9
3570,"Well, let me say this upfront, if you're a Matrix fanboy/ girl (like me) then you'll get the point and pardon (and maybe empathise and thank) Lana Wachowski for killing any future plans of reviving the Matrix franchise and also making sure that that this 4th instalment (if you can call it that) to be absolutely forgotten and never be linked to the original trilogy in any aspect. I'm pretty damn sure neither of the Wachowskis wanted a 4th Matrix. The Trilogy is exhaustive enough in itself.It seems to me that the movie was forced upon the Wachowski and one of the siblings made sure that the Warner Bros studio and anyone in the world who thought there was a need for a 4th Matrix movie was put in their place and were silenced for good.And boy does Lana deliver on this agenda vehemently. This is a rather bold, courageous movie making endeavour to drive the point that this whole idea of reboots is Total BS. The movie from the get go sets on this path of self destruction in splendid style and superb self deprecating humour which I have never witnessed in cinematic history before (that's partly why I rate it 6). The whole movie seems like a big budget SNL sketch with very telling commentary on this prevalence of reviving classics and reducing them to money making cash cows.The movie seems to be on purpose made Bad. In everything and most of all the areas which the audience would look forward to - plot, action, soundtrack. Nothing comes close to what the Trilogy is known for, on the contrary you'll notice Lana teasing us with the nostalgia in more than one ways and telling us (the loyal fanbase) from behind the camera that this movie doesn't deserve to exist.I give it a 6 only as vote of thanks to Lana for showing the studios that they can't always have their way with creators and audiences from behind their studio contracts and IP ownerships.Thank you Lana and Andy for giving us the Trilogy and making sure there's no room for anything more to the story. Good on you guys!",6
3571,Long slow and filled with unnecessary amounts of chatter and tedious explanations about how and what and when regarding the architect role - the agent isn't as badass and evil as we liked him and Neo is a shadow of his former self - like a reunion with the sport star from your younger yearsAnd when the action finally begins they went overboard and diverted even further from the known and liked original universe og the matrix trilogy.,2
3572,"I think in reality happened like in the beginning like in the movie, Keanu was squeezed one last time to try and fill the big corporations throats with fresh cash and hopefully a new milking cow., but it didn't work, the movie is boring.",2
3573,"""The matrix resurrections"" is, as expected, a mediocre film at best. The pacing feels off, some parts of the movie are difficult to understand for most casual fans and as a whole this movie is more of a love story than an action movie. The first half of the film had its problems but wasn't atrocious while the second half, when the whole love story thing happens, absolutely ruined this film for me. It seems like Warner bros didn't care enough to make this film anything more than a forgettable sequel to the trilogy.",5
3574,"This movie was so much better then was actually expecting because of all the negativity around it.At first may seem confusing and odd, however with time it all starts to make sense, give it a chance. Very creative return to an amazing original trilogy that actually is not a retelling however an addition to it. Also, the main purpose of this movie in all honesty is a love story, and what I found about this movie was that it really sealed that love story from the other 3 movies. Great movie, no idea why so much hate over it, was actually a perfect end to the original trilogy.",10
3575,"I read a bunch of negative reviews but as a huge matrix fan I thought I should at least give Resurrections a chance and watch it at the cinemas. I don't think it's as bad as some of the reviews I've read but it's also the worst of the 4.Just to put this in context I LOVE the matrix. To this day Matrix 1 is my fav movie ever and unlike some I really enjoyed the last 2.The problem with Resurrections is it just tries too hard to be a parody of itself. Almost felt like a fan made movie that wanted to bring back the nostalgia of the original but failed at doing so. There are so many scenes that are basically clones of the original it's tiring. Then worse than that are the constant flashbacks of the original trilogy. If I said there was literally 5 minutes of scenes from the matrix I wouldn't be exaggerating. Almost felt like every 10 minutes they needed to show a flashback. It got tiring like watching a simpsons rerun episode.Add to that the length of the movie 2.5 hours was just too dang long. The lack of substance in the story didn't justify the length and had me feeling restless by the end.The characters were all pretty forgettable, even the new morpheus didn't really have an important role. The most interesting scenes were with Jessica Henwick (blue haired chick) she's an amazing martial artist and added some cool special effects moments. Unfortunately most of the cool scenes you will see are in the trailer, since there really isn't much action in this movie.My biggest issue though is it all just felt like a weaker watered down version of the matrix. Even Neo always felt like Neo 0.5 not the god level Neo we are used to. That I think is it's biggest let down. How do go from full all out world ending action scenes to this? Once you've driven 200ks an hour 80kms feels slow.Too slow, not enough action. Hardly any kung fu. Weak characters. Pointless no direction story. Couple of good actions scenes. That unfortunately is the new Matrix.",6
3576,"Easily the worst of the Matrix lot. Fishburne did not return as Morpheus, and Weaving did not return as Smith. Those were two very important casting decisions that effected the quality. The plot was also not up to par. The film seemed hurriedly written, not very well acted, and hastily put together.",4
3577,"This trilogy was so close to my heart for my own reasons and having literally dreamed of one day hearing that matrix 4 would come to us, I was stoked to finally watch it.I don't know how to feel about it.As much as it hurts my heart to say, it probably wasn't needed and I probably would have preferred to never have seen it. But since I have, what can I say?Purists won't enjoy it mainly for the seemingly forced 'wokeness' of it. That's why the first movie was so good, it created this intense subculture of people who did question more. Now it's like the flavour of the week and this movie sums that up perfectly.New viewers probably would specifically for that reason I mentioned above.Either way, Keanu looked like he let go of Neo a long, long time ago. The character felt lifeless and painfully alien to me.Trinity was brilliant with what she was given to work with. Together they brought back my first ship which in itself made this movie endearing to me.Other than that, not much else too add.They relied too heavily on flashbacks that it formed basically 30% of the movie which I find a cop out.I feel dirty writing negative things about it but my heart just didn't flutter with the wide eyed awe I hoped I would once again relive.Hope it brings you more happiness, ye whoever reads this.",6
3578,"The movie brought feelings of nostalgia but to watch was work, I fear it may have done damage to Keanu Reeves return to fame as well as the Matrix legacy. Overall the movie had to many changes and copied previous matrix films it seemed like recycled garbage to me.",2
3579,"Is it as good as 1,2 and 3...no way..it's entertaining but takes them over an hour to explain how he is still alive ..it's fun to watch bit it's nothing along the lines as the first 3..",6
3580,"You have set the perfect place to start an explosive trilogy with 2 new movies.Both Neo and Trinity are The One. They are the most powerful of all in the matrix, not even the machines can stop them. They could bring an end to the machine war, eradicate bad programs, set up a new unified human/machine society, that works to undo the damage of the sky, and ends with them restoring earth, and moving off into the galaxy to explore and make new habitable places with human and machine thriving.",10
3581,"What was this film if not a soulless cash grab?Watching this felt like I was watching a ""Previous, on the Matrix"" recap from a weird alternate reality.There were things I recognized like iconic scenes and characters - all with plot points I've seen across 3 different movies yet I didn't connect with any of them and none of them seemed coherent or justified.I wanted this film to be good, but this felt so scrambled together and overall probably would have been better had they started with new characters and a new plot - perhaps a prologue? But no. The film just plots along aimlessly nudging you on the shoulder shouting "" 'member this? "" and occasionally takes a break to fill you with rushed exposition or try on ""haha aren't we meta"" jokes.I think a hallmark of a good sequel, is to see how it stands on its own - and if you remove the footage from older Matrix films and change character names etc. It'd be hard to decipher what world this film and it's characters are supposed to be apart of.",3
3582,"Neither should you.From the people that have watched it, I did not hear nothing positive. At one point someone has told me that Agent Smith does omg humor. Leave that californication humour out of this franchise.Lana Wachowski, do not mess with legends.",1
3583,"What this movie should have been:After the events of Revolutions, the machines were unable to delete Neo and Smith completely due to a fail- safe code that Smith left with the Oracle somehow. The new, now combined ""Neo/Smith"" are at war with themselves and in the process destroying both the matrix and the real world. After unsuccessfully battling this new threat, the machines work with Zion to ressurrect Trinity. If she can reach what is left of Neo, combined they might have a chance to defeat Smith for good, save the world, and together become the true ""one.""This cannot be any worse that what the plot actually is.",5
3584,"The first matrix was an extraordinary film which will stay one of my favorite films of all time. The second and the third were also very good but not like the first one but at least they kept the atmosphere of the original to a certain degree with the fight scenes and the colors (the lightning) like the light green background while in the matrix, sophisticated and smart dialogue, psychological and spiritual hints etc.. but this sequel feels like a forced sequel with no soul. The fight scenes were terrible, the dialogue was lame and boring, and the side characters were easy to forget. The whole atmosphere of this sequel is not like the previous matrix movies at all. Don't expect a lot of this matrix sequel after waiting 20 years. I gave it 5 stars just because Keanu Reeves in it and i don't know why he agreed to do this forced and soulless sequel.",5
3585,"So, for all the heaters out ther, just stop it. It was pretty entertaining and was fun to watch. Was it necessary? Did it add anything meaningful to the story? Nop. Completly unnecessary. But it was not a wast of money and I had a good time. So, yeah, go watch it and have a good time as well.",6
3586,"But it wasn't so bad, OK the story is not perfect or brilliant but it's never could be, but in general it's ok. I hope there will not be another part as I don't want to see the same what happened to Start Wars.",7
3587,"Don't bother, it's 2 hours and 28 minutes you'll wish you'd spent cleaning the house, or getting a root canal, or pulling ticks from the swollen ass of a rabid baboon. 🙄",1
3588,"I specially registered to leave a rating and review. The film has nothing. To my great love for Keanu, but then I could not look at him, the years take their toll for him to retire. The whole film is all so much so that nothing is invisible, the fights are intermixed like necks and this trembling camera is just disgusting! In the end, people are like zombies and again complete darkness and these movements neo how he lamented them is horror. Lana thought if she made the trinity fly it would be epic, but no. This film is a mistake and the ego needs to be removed.",3
3589,Like other fans I have been waiting for this movie. There are many cool things about this movie but less is more in this case. This movie doesn't add anything to the trilogy. They should have stopped after nr. 3. The first half is basically flashbacks from the trilogy. Either there is a sequal to this movie or this is a bad attempt to do .... well im not sure. Very disappointed....,4
3590,"Beautiful. Amazing. Breathtaking. As a huge Matrix fan I couldn't wait to watch Resurrections and it exceeds all my expectations. Full with metaphors and analogies which means it is for those who can open their minds and who are able to experience this world (or other worlds) on another level as well.Well done, Lana, well done. Thank you.If you are reading this and haven't seen the movie yet, please don't believe the haters. Let your own heart guide you and make your own choice. We are controlled in so many other ways.",10
3591,Loved the three first three Matrix movies and was excited to finally watch this. But I had to stop watching half way as it was so bad. Sjould have had Laurence Fishburne and the original Smith actor and then it would have saved it some..,3
3592,"I am hard Matrix fanboy. Have watched the original matrix 5 times at least. 2 and 3 at least 3 times.So I couldnt wait to watch my favorite childhood characters on the big screen again.The movie has a story, not as complex as the original, but honestly the 4th part of any movie just cant be more original than the original. The story was faily simple, though I did miss some points, such as the Doctors' intention behind all this.The action was above average, expected a bit more from a movie like Matrix.The new characters were great, but some didnt get enough time or background, I believe.VFX is top notch, some scenes were just breathtaking.Overall, I couldnt have asked for a better ""resurrection"" of the Matrix, came out of the theater with smile in my face.Not really sure where the bad reviews come from, but if you are a matrix fan, just go and have fun. You wont regret it, mark my word.",8
3593,"I got the message clearly: there should be no more matrix film. But it should be not that way to say it.I think, most of the people, who really loves the Universum of Matrix deeply, doesn't deserve this way of disappointment.It just breaked heart...",1
3594,"When I heard they were doing a fourth Matrix movie, I felt excited and worried. Given how the trilogy ended, I knew the producers would have to ""pull a Marvel"" to bring characters back. Their explanation felt lazy and forced.But, the biggest problem with the movie is with its tone. Everything seems to be thrown at the viewer:Let's mock ourselves for a blatant cash grab.Let's mimic and recreate scenes from the original.Let's make this a love story.Let's change what it means to be the one.This messy tone is due to a script with no clear story to tell. If someone asked me to explain the story, I couldn't. Read the logline description for Resurrections versus the original Matrix. The logline for Resurrections is both blurry and inaccurate. It doesn't describe the movie at all. The logline for the Matrix neatly sums up the entire story.I wonder if this is a movie that you have to watch a few times to understand the story. Unfortunately, I don't think it's that slick or sophisticated of a script. There are lots of callbacks and Easter Eggs, and those may be fun to watch for on multiple viewings.As others have pointed out, the original trilogy used a green hue when inside the matrix. That's missing here. Is that by design because this is an all-new matrix? Not sure. Likewise, the music isn't as dramatic and impactful this time around. Also, the action scenes are all close-cut with fast edits. All of this, when taken together, makes for a very different experience from the trilogy.I feel the producers missed a huge opportunity. The matrix is a unique world that could/should allow for endless storytelling. If you think about it, the entire concept is a ""cinematic universe"" that so many others try to build. They could have used de-aging VFX to incorporate Neo and Trinity into a different story, instead of having them older and needing to explain it. They could have rebooted a new Matrix with a new cast. They could have done a prequel with Morpheous on the hunt for other ""ones"" before finding Neo. I feel there were so many better - clearer - story ideas they could have pursued. Resurrections is too messy and too all over the place.",5
3595,"Yes, they had bad ass women, but if they were going for woke they failed, the original had bad ass women. The action was good and I know they didn't mean too, but the free mind idea was so right wing today. I think it's worth a watch, if it has a message, it's don't become part of the the sheople and we know what side that is. But the action was good, it's a mindless action flick that thinks it's more than it is.",6
3596,Omg what i just saw? Why this movie was so bad ? I'm asking my self the same thing all the time from the minute I saw the movie. After the first 30 minutes the movie was not going nowhere. Big disappointment !,1
3597,"The film is quite enjoyable, as long as you don't expect to feel after it like you felt after the first three films, which gave you the feeling that there must be more to the world than what is before your eyes. After this film, I'm quite happy to be in the real world again, after a somewhat limited film.So, people are sharply dressed, there's some pertinent social commentary, quite a bit of humour and.a happy ending. That's all good. So is the action.Bad? Well, bad as such is only the new Zion. If you can create a strawberry out of a datafile, surely you can also get rid of Niobe's wrinkles?You know, it's funny. I've been saying for some time now that the fact that Hollywood can only come up with dystopias in the face of new technology says something about that technology. This is a utopia for once, but the greatest benefit of superhuman artificial intelligence? Strawberries.No, it's safe to assume that ZARDOZ, although not really meant as a utopia, still captures the imagination: eternal youth, wireless linking of brains with computers, can't beat that.And since I'm talking about this... yes, the old Zion was a war matrix. And the new Zion? Look, it's always a rat race, right? Whether it's powerful humans and the dynamics of their system or powerful machines and the dynamics of their system, you better run or you're out, because, if you had time to do what you want and wouldn't be overrun by history, who knows what you would do and who'd you overrun? It's not that difficult.In the beginning I was thinking: Training modules, cool idea, let's make a film about that, who cares about Neo and Trinity? Well, when the guy said he found out he's really Morpheus, I knew that there wouldn't be any metaphors or riddles in this. But... everybody is allowed to make the film he wants. And this is what it is and it makes little sense to criticise it for what it isn't.",7
3598,I rewatched the entire trilogy so that I would be completely where I needed to be when watching this reboot... The first movie and somewhat the second change cinematography as we knew it in the early 2000s... The third subset of the trilogy really lost its place and became the quasimoto doomsday save humanity good vs evil equation.I watched this reboot with goose pimple anticipation of being witness to the next generation life-changing visual mental cinematography...Nope! 2003 in 2021... Thank God I had HBO Max or otherwise I would have asked for a refund.,6
3599,"The initial idea in the first half hour could also be there. I was harboring a hope that it might turn out to be interesting, despite expecting a disappointment. But in the end the disappointment came. The historical characters have been desecrated, both the good ones and the bad ones, the elegance of the original trilogy has been desecrated (yes, I'm one of those who appreciated the whole trilogy), the very meaning of the sacrifice of Trinity and Neo in the third film was completely distorted and canceled. In the end, the film falls into the most absolute banality, destroying the sense of antagonism between humans and machines.For me there are two cases: either it is a film made only to make a profit, or it represents the intellectual decay of the authors.",2
3600,"""The Matrix Resurrections"" it's a Matrix movie and it's not about The Matrix, as the title suggests. The entire movie is about the lost love between Neo and Trinity, which is now called ""Tiffany"". I guess what this movie lacks the most is the focus on the main idea that guaranteed the success of the first trilogy in the first place and that is ""The Matrix"". The movie feels strange... Of course, it's about a virtual simulation that is called ""The Matrix"", but it doesn't create the same aura of mistery that has been created in the first trilogy.I don't know... Probably the main idea of this movie is a good one, especially because has been made by one of the original producers of ""The Matrix"", but it is how you put it into perspective that matters most and the movie failed to do this. I didn't understand too much from it, because I think that there is nothing to understand. There are a lot of senseless things that happen and you don't even get an explanation for them, or you don't even know why something is happening, when is happening.The level of acting is high enough, the special effects are also good, but even the first trilogy had some badass special effects for their time and what matters most is the way how the storyline is told and this is what this movie lacks. It has a foggy beginning, because you don't exactly understand how the events that occured at the ending of the original trilogy, are connected with those that takes place now and besides of this, the movie isn't entertaining enough... I think that it deserves a rating of 5.",5
3601,"I really appreciate everything they tried to do and tell through this movie, all the concepts and existential questions... I enjoyed the action and visuals, I found it efficient and fairly solid. I like the design of the movie and how it looks overall.I personally think that it's more about the experience that you take from this screening, that it differs from the previous three episodes of the franchise. It doesn't impact you on all levels, the way the three other movies do...But I'm not one of these people who think it is an unnecessary addition to the franchise and that it should be erased from the cannon of the saga.I think it brings a lot to the franchise, and I think the strengths of the movie lie in what is added to the conversation around this universe and all the fascinating topics about it all. I like all of the meta elements, because it bounces between everything that you know from the lore or things that you're learning on-the-go, and links it all in a way that satisfied me quite well. I really enjoyed how all the story evolves and where it ends.It is a weird feeling to describe this movie, because even if it feels like the weakest movie of the saga, it also feels like the one who took the most risks and tried the most to tell you a lot lot more about the lore and its pretty cool questions.So yeah. I'm very happy it exists and will explore it more, because there's some interesting meat on that bone...",6
3602,I love the Matrix movies.... But this movie wasn't impressive at all. Almost fell asleep. Definitely glad I didn't bother going to see this in theaters. Won't be recommending this a movie or watching again.,2
3603,"Not sure why so many critics on here have such a downer on this movie - i loved it !!!The original was an absolute classic and this took me right back, bringing me those same emotions all over again.Thoroughly recommended.",9
3604,"With a slower start that may seem time consuming to most... to me this a completely necessary!This film reminds you of what you loved from the original Trilogy all while developing a fresh take on the old/new Matrix world.As a Wachowski fan I was so happy to see some of the cast from ""Sense8"" getting the chance to reunite and play on this Matrix world.This film delivered those epic fight scenes, an open interpretation script... to me this was brilliant and it gets better with each viewing!Do not let the poor reviews stop you from enjoying! I suggest re-watching the previous 3 films before jumping into resurrections!So worth the wait! I am hoping Lana builds on this with more films! Would love if Lilly jumps on for future movies!!!",8
3605,"Despite the films choppy, uneven editing and pacing, Matrix Resurrections is more of a character study about Neo &amp; Trinity. For as many problems as I had with the filmmaking decisions I found myself entertained, regardless.",6
3606,"The Matrix (1999) is my favourite movie.I went in with an open mind, knowing it was going to be something different. I was enjoying the first act. Then it became a train wreck.This movie has been compared to The Last Jedi in terms of being a sequel that takes risks. At least ""The Last Jedi"" knew what it wanted to bethis be. This movie is a directionless mess. Don't waste your time.",3
3607,"Ok, wow I can understand while people may have walked out of this film during the first hour, it honestly seemed like a cheap parody of the original films I just could not see how this film could be redeemed, then it seemed in the last hour once neo had been ' released ' we got back to what made us enjoy the original film/s, now let's not kid about the special effects aren't even in the same ball park as the originals whether or not it was lower budget I don't know but it was lacking, that aside I resonated with the cast who took on the final part of the film, they were funny and I was genuinely worried they wouldn't all make it to the end, no idea how he got there but I thought the new smith was brilliant with a twist at the end , shout out to bugs and the new Morpheus they were entertaining in all of their scenes, so to summerise don't be put off by the first few acts I think you'll be happy enough come the end credits and.",8
3608,"I was excited but kind of dreading watching this.Sometimes when they release a new movie or a reboot, it can be really bad, or just simply disappointing.This did not disappoint at all.Brilliant references to the original films, explained a lot of unanswered questions. Great casting. I can't wait fornthe next movie.Only downside is, I really wish they had the original morphius in the film.",10
3609,"The first 10 minutes is just the original matrix, but with horrible acting. Everything is a worse rehash of the original movie. We all know why this was made; and it is sad. Forget this ""movie"" ever existed.",2
3610,I Had high hopes for this movie. It's not bad but not great either . To many flashbacks of the original in the movie it just felt like they needed space fillers and the start was very slow.,5
3611,"Well, I don't write much reviews but I was simply shocked. Wtf was this!? I can't believe there is some people who gave 10 to this movie. I loved Matrix and I was excited to see this sequel, but this movie just made me angry. I never rated a movie with 1, but honestly, this movie deserves a 0. Simply, this movie is a joke. Very disappointed.",1
3612,"Okay, this movie has a lot and I mean ALOT, Of negative reviews. Personally, I like how Lana made it, a good nostalgic throwback and experience to the other 3, while making something... bold, spectacular, and different from the others. Sure it's weird not seeing Fishburne as Morpheus, and Weaving as Smith, but just 'unplug' and enjoy it! Definitely a must own.",10
3613,"When I watched the first trilogy 20 years ago, it was a life changer, and I was never getting tired of watching it again and again every now and then. Characters had a powerful presence: Morpheus, Smith, The Oracle, The Merovingian, The Architect... They all taught us precious lessons, it was as the Architect said: ""A work of art, flawless, sublime""When I heard about The Matrix Resurrections, I was expecting nothing less, especially regarding how the world in which we live now is changing dramatically: but God, how I was disappointed. All the powerful presence of the past characters was no more, it was totally focused on getting back Neo and Trinity with a shallow ""Why"". I am not even considering watching it again.",5
3614,"I can see "" the director told the audience that she really dosen't want to make this movie"". Many key roles have been omitted or replaced, and the flashback scenes obviously destroyed narratives. Of course, the most important thing is that the storytelling and action design are nothing new compared to the trilogy. It is more of a comforting feast for fans.",6
3615,They should have invited Laurence Fishburne and worked around Hugo Weaving's schedule to involve them in this 4th film. It just wasn't the same without them.First time writing a review on IMDB.,1
3616,"Don't expect to find a sequel of Matrix here, the trilogy is over and this is something different. Even the director state it in the movie in a parodic style. So it'd be easy to criticise this weird proposal from the point of view of a fan of the saga. However, it's not that bad. Some parts of the movie are quite clever, specially the.first third, it's not the typical money grab movie from Hollywood Studios. Instead, it's.a protest movie from the director,crying out to let the original trilogy rest in peace forever, and proposing a completely new story reusing some of the elements that made Matrix unique.",7
3617,"I read the reviews people have written and im on the other end of the fence, i loved it, and it was exactly what i want in a film.... yes a FILM, something to remove your from the daily worries and turmoil we are going through and to loose yourself in some good sifi action, and not have to think about anything else, or over think and analyse every millisecond of what happened, to me it is a good sequel, not a reboot or rehash, it answered some basic questions like ""what happened to Zion"" and ""how did they live"" as well as flashback to the original helping Neo figure out that he was stuck back in the matrix, and didn't just wake up with all his powers and wipe it all out, my only real negative would be with ""smith"", he kept calling him Tom but (in my opinion) he should have stuck with Mr Andersonthe tie in to the original films works well and some real thought had gone into the script, and. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II slight mock/impersonation of Morpheus 1 added a good little bit of humour, even The Merovingian ranting about the franchise and a spin off made me chuckle.",9
3618,"Glad i didn't drive to the theater. If they had added a couple hot chicks, i would've put up with this nonsense. And now I'm still typing just to reach the 150 character minimum.",1
3619,I'm so glad I got to see this for free. Nothing but a blatant money grab. Too many plot holes to even begin to mention. NPH was actually the only bright spot in the whole thing.,1
3620,"I love the original films, all three of them. With this movie you get neither The Matrix nor anything else enjoyable.The story is a mess, filled with nonsensical techobabble to conceal weak writing and plot holes. So too is much of the dialogs, coming of as stilted and uninspired.Keeping things fresh is good, taking out what separates your movie from others and filling it with a weak love plot and poorly hidden double meanings is not.If you love the trilogy, give this one a pass as it can only tarnish your memory of the originals.",2
3621,"Okey so I tried to give it a fair try and I wanted to love it. The first 20 min are the worst of the movie, it gets better.They changed the concept in to some kind of ""the power of love"" movie. Got a few of the good actors and the rest are just ""meh"" not bad but nothing you will remember tomorrow. It's just feels like a money grab.Kinda disappointed that Keanu Reeves now plays in money milking movies.",4
3622,Wachowski's have failed again sorry to say. I don't think any sequel to the matrix could ever be as equal to The Matrix. 2 &amp; 3 were unwatchable. This was worse. I wanted to like this film as I like Keanu in his later life roles but unfortunately for him the story was terrible. The lack of Laurence Fishburne was such an obvious miss. As well as Hugo Weaving. Can we really take Neil Patrick Harris seriously as a baddie? No. Can't get past his Dougie Howser.,2
3623,"The goodsI personally liked the first half of the film, in fact, I loved the idea that First trilogy was most likely inside Thomas Anderson's mind and that it was a game he created and it became a big hit. I like the part that, they were making Matrix 4, that felt real meta. I liked the I especially liked the scene where Tom and Tiffany (Neo and Trinity) had their moments in the coffee shop, in fact, for the first time I actually believed in their romance. I thought him looking in the mirror and everyone really seeing him as an old man was clever. The train scene was awesome, in fact, I like the way anyone can be possessed rather than turning into agents. I liked the fact the machine, and human can live in harmony, and that they can grow crops and vegetations, it makes Real World feel like a place where you want to go rather then living in Matrix. I did liked all the callbacks.The badI thought the action felt really flat, especially during the final showdown. NPH as the main villain just felt random, I liked him better as a Therapist. Smith was under utilized when he should've been the main antagonist rather than NPH, in fact, felt they could've done more with Smith. Jonathan Groff is a great, and talented actor/performer; however, thought he was miscasted as Smith; rather he should've been casted as another new character, same goes for Morpheus. I especially didn't like it when Neo and Trinity became this powerful force once they holds hand.But these are all my personal take. Started out really good, then it just turned flat. Disappointing and forgettable.",5
3624,"Made an account just to give this film bad review, one of the worst films I've ever seen. Creators don't get to choose the audience of their art, if you don't like the people who support your art too bad.",1
3625,"I was hoping for so much more and left the theatre kind of disappointed. No disrespect to Keanu Reeves or Carrie Ann Moss, who are GREAT actors, but the first half hour or so of the film was painfully slow. Some of the action scenes were entertaining, and there wasn't too much of it, which is surprising given the run time of nearly 2 1/2 hours. I hate to say this, but it almost felt like a spoof at times. Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) is also absent from this film and another actor plays the ""new"" Morpheus, which also left me disappointed, but the ""new"" Morpheus"" seems to tie in with the plot regardless. Despite this fact, Fishburne still does make an appearance, although only through archive footage from the original trilogy. It has been suggested online that his version of Morpheus was killed in a previous video game release (""The Matrix Online"" circa 2005) and that the writers decided to remain true to that plot.Neo is now a video game designer and gets sucked back into The Matrix after having signals sent to him through his computer by a character from his past. Several references to the franchise are actually made within the film itself as well. Their own production company, Warner Brothers, is name dropped too! Not sure if they thought that would be funny, for marketing purposes, or both. In summary, this film missed the mark for me and you'd be better off waiting until streaming platforms pick it up over paying more to see it in theatres.",6
3626,Trite money grab making a mockery of its original genius and failing to make a good point regarding obnoxious corporate driven mega sequels in the process. The first Matrix is enough for this viewer and Buddhist.,2
3627,Go watch for yourself! Don't believe the Hate! Of course it's Matrix! I loved every single Moment! Thank you Lana for this Christmas Gift! Welcome back Mr Anderson.,10
3628,"The Matrix Resurrection,lacks the spark and spontaneity of the original Matrix Typtych.It falls flat and is an uncessary addition to the original Matrix Trilogy,a bad addition to an already perfect original set of films.",5
3629,Watched Matrix Resurrections yesterday!Such a brilliant movie!The movie is self criticizing its own 90s structures and aesthetics. It deconstructs this authoritarian attitude of black and white or good and evil.Gives a strong message to contemporary capitalism.I highly recommend to watch this.So sad to read all these shallow reviews...Well done Lana Wachowski💚🖤💚,10
3630,"Good story, action, acting, sci-fi.I don't know why people gave bad review about it.I really enjoyed the movie...,....................Whole team has done good job.",9
3631,"This movie is bad in a good way, you are entertained a little, but it is not as bad as people say, and way above 1 star.THe sad thing is that Martin lawrence is not in this movie, and that is not good.Keanu and moss are doing agreat job.So watch it but don´t expect something special, it is ok as a movie that is it.",6
3632,"Well, I officially walked in with some skepticism thinking the formula for the first run couldn't be recreated. But, I found myself to be surprised by the continuity storyline actually working. Then it really got going and going and I was happy! I delivered for. I guess you had to be a fan to like it. Good movie!",8
3633,"In 1999, the world witnessed The Matrix - a revolution in cinematic storytelling and technique. Thousands of filmmakers from across the globe ripped and ripened the cutting edge action sequences of the classic sci-fi action thriller. Just like the protagonist of the film, 'The Matrix' was The One that stood out.Fast forward 22 years (60 years in the Matrix Universe since Matrix Revolutions), the Matrix does a reboot to cater to the taste of the new MMO video-game generation while keeping sentiments of the original fans alive, frequently picking on itself in the first act.They set the story in a simulation where Thomas Anderson is a world-famous game designer who made the video-game called The Matrix. Now, he is tasked to make a reboot, but then he keeps getting these visuals or dreams or whatever you want to call them. He sees the therapist played by Neil Patrick Harris, who keeps telling Thomas that the Matrix was just a game he designed, and that his mind was losing grip on reality, hence the vision and confusion.But since someone has to drive the narrative forward, there are a bunch of young recruits who have been influenced by Neo, who come to get him back to the 'real world' where machines are not united anymore. Humans have aligned with some machines to keep the system running in peace. Wait, what, then what is Neo doing here if people had finally existed in harmony? To liberate Tiffany... err... Trinity, the love interest.... Ufff!!!Matrix Resurrections is a stylish film high on concept and everything, but there was something seriously lacking with the motivation of the protagonist. If I wasn't a fan of the original trilogy, I wouldn't have even cared to root for Thomas Anderson a.k.a Neo. Keanu Reeves looks hot but boy does he struggle to maintain the charm, and they haven't hidden it at all, which makes it believable. Neil Patrick Harris is the bad guy in this one. Priyanka Chopra Jones is there as the face of diversity, with literally nothing significant to do in this one. I really wished she played The Oracle. I am sure she has a higher purpose in the sequel just like Carrie-Anne Moss.Rating - 2.5/5Serpent's Verdict - Matrix Resurrections is an average movie when you compare it with the original trilogy. Watch it for a little nostalgia. You won't be bored despite the length of the movie.",5
3634,Very average with a poor story and some very average action sequences. Not sure why this was made. Was great seeing Neo and Trinity back together but even that cant save this movie.,4
3635,"First scenario; Assume you didnt watch first three movies; then you will feel the movie is very dull, no real story, no real action, there are no intraconnections to anything except neo and trinity and it is only upto some content.Last words: *The movie was like worse version of ""Supernatural"".*Second scenario: You watched trilogy, you are a fan or not...(This applies to me, i am a fan, i'll speak in my point of view)I am highly disappointed. The movie is screened like they are in a rush. Even i know how well some of the characters, still i felt like they are strangers. When i watched the trailer, i tought how nicely they adapted new Morpheus, but no. Who is main antogonist? How fast Trinity changed her mind? Etc. Lots of unexplained or rushly executed things...Last words: *I think they tried to remain some elements as mystic and as mystery but they were in fact misery.*Only plus is, i went back 20 years and felt those times in The Matrix World and also my life again. I realized how older i got, reimagined memories related or unrelated to The Matrix trilogy.",4
3636,"Already gave a Google review , too bad to write allover again.They should have left Neo and Trinity die than to resurrect them for this horrible movie.The movie dint have a vibe as the previous movies. Neo looked homeless the entire movie. The cast dint have any style of the previous movies. Action sequences were below average . Hope the writer never gets to write another movie or sequels for that matter.poor production.",1
3637,"I was so excited to see this movie come out I'm a hug fan of all the Matrix movies from the 1st one to the over use SGI last two before this one, with that being said the storyline was amazing the acting was very good and love being the undying drive for one person is very clear with neo but personally I understand the logic behind what they did to neo which was pretty genius if I may say so myself rewriting him him but also keeping him around for a safety safety measure but the execution on how they brought him back its one thing to erase is memories but then when he do get it back he is a wish up of his old self this version of him was to the point awful he went from a almighty to sorry citizen even when he did get everything back he use the same move for most of the movie so neo had no upgrade to him it had a little to much talking a lot of it could have been cut out and focus more on other details of the movie they could have focus more on the machines going to war fighting each other if this is the last neo matrix base movie its a great send off.",6
3638,"It felt like an appropriate beginning for a new trilogy. Don't know if they'll get to continue the story, but for someone who is a pretty die hard matrix fan (and a Sense8 fan), I found it both enjoyable and satisfying.",8
3639,"It comes down to this. Keanu is Lebron James, they're trying to make them do a Video Game/Film that they don't want to sign onto...So Warner Bros. Just redid the SpaceJam 2021 story but they did it with The Matrix this time...That's extremely odd and the Matrix universe even makes an appearance in the SpaceJam 2021 film. Kinda lame of Warner to do this... but atleast The Matrix 4 is much BETTER than Space Jam 2021.",8
3640,"From a fan of The Matrix: skip this one, unless you just wanna waste sometime, fall asleep, or see how bad this is for yourself.*next, not realy but potential spoilers...The movie has almost nothing to do with the old trilogy except in poorly matching some characters, creating flimsy references or connections, and attempting to re-make the first matrix. They added some tricks, piled features of differentcategories including romantic (with, some I guess, jokes) to make it better than it is, but that nothing could reverse the nonsense and the complete lack of substance in this movie.",3
3641,"I love the Matrix, the original, from where this hideous copy tries to steal and make a dime.Could not even stand till its end. Complete lack of creativity. If you copy from someone else it's plagiarism. What do you call it when someone copies from their own work (one starts wondering if it was their work to begin with)",3
3642,"Spoilers below.I loved the first movie. Not really the next two. But I had a brain injury in August 03. So, when I watched them, I am not sure if my mind was fully healed. I was excited to see a new movie. Here are my thoughts.I didn't take my eyes off the screen. I was so hooked on the story. I was very excited to see what would happen.The effects looked cool. The set and all that was interesting.I didn't like the rest. Well, I did to a point.First, it just seems to play off the old movie too much. You see scenes from the others. Then, at a point, I just felt like I was watching a bunch of cars drive fast on the street with explosions. There seemed to be no feeling in any of those scenes.They kind of well into the story to fast. They didn't have much of a setup because they relied on the past movies. It just felt like I was watching something made my fans of something.The fighting was cool, but it's been done. They had people run up walls a few times, but it felt like even those that made the movie were sick of those scenes.How they came back kind of bothered me. It's not them. They are closes built by a machine. Which I find interesting because it is that machine for with which they are fighting against.The worst part was at the end of the movie. The last few lines spoken. They gave me an instant feeling that the entire movie was made just so those lines could be said.I did watch it. I was excited. I just feel like they need more of a story. I mean it really does feel like there was no point to anything but that last part.",5
3643,"It all seems just a bit off. I respect the attempt to bring some new life to the story, but not if the price is destroying the image of the original characters.At times the first act seems to be leading us down a path liken to scream 1. But things are so meta it doesn't fit the overtone of the first 3 films.Casting is way off and although it hurts me to say it Reeves misted the mark. Maybe if he simply cut his hair and shaved the beard for the whole film it would have felt more like an old friend than just John wick.This one will need more than one watch to give it justice. But i think we cab agree that in this case maybe two sisters would have been better than one!",4
3644,Hollywood should blacklist Wachovski after the piece.One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Even Keanu does not save it and acts like a robot. All other actors feel like they came from an amateur theatre. No... Even amateur theatres often have better actors.The picture is a parody to the original movie. Keanu learning to fly for 2.5 h ? You had better go to a flight school man...,1
3645,"When I was watching this, I started with these feelings. I recommend you don't do that, even though that question is in all of us...That is all i will say.",7
3646,"I Am Totally Dissapointed From What 2021's Reboots And Sequels Showed Us. First ""Mortal Kombat"" (2021) Ruined My Whole Childhood Passion And Expectations About My Favorite Game And Movies Of All Times. Then There Was This Second Mistake Called ""Dune"", Followed By ""Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City"" And My Only Hope Was ""The Matrix Resurrections"". Fortunatelly The Last One Got Highest Vote From Me Among The Previous Ones Mentioned Above. I Voted Them With 1 Star Or Maximum 4. The Matrix Gets 6 Stars Because It Can't Get Just 1! I Know It's Dissapointing To All Fans But It Doesn't Deserve It. It Has Its Deep Meaning And Parallels With The World We Live In. So What They Showed Us Is Very Authentic. Nothing Could Be Compared To The 1st Classic So I'll Just Leave This Movie Not Ruining My Passion About The Trilogy And Consider It As An Apart One As An Another Version Of Matrix Which Actually It Is.:)",6
3647,It is an OK movie I guess but this is not enough to justify its existence for me. And I would have preferred more original ideas rather than a remake of all the iconic scenes from the first movie.The best part of the movie is that it makes me want to see the first Matrix again.,6
3648,"How does the quality decrease technically and visually after 23 years? It's like Netflix-style low-budget sci-fi movies. The color is bad. There is no depth. Also, those slow motion scenes suck.",1
3649,"Matrix is back after decades,after the disappointing sequels. Matrix ressuruction .the movie was supposed to be titled LOVE and love only .what a Garbage movie.still relying on trinity and no love story .bad plot ,bad direction,bad action sequence..everything is bad with this movie.there is not any single sequence which grabbed my attention.The worst sequel in the Matrix quadrology which made reloa nd revelations legendary after watching this.",4
3650,"I saw the original trilogy in the theater. I thought parts 2 and especially 3 were just boring. A friend who accompanied me for part 3 actually fell asleep during the movie. I can hardly remember what the plot was about.This fourth part, while certainly not perfect, is well made with some sophisticated action scenes with a kind of suspended motion effect I have not seen in this quality before. Not great, but entertaining and fun. It seems to be targeted at an older audience that has seen the older movies when they came out. Refreshing to have heroes for once who are not 20 years younger than me.",8
3651,"I really cannot understand how people can give this nice to watch movie a 1 Star Rating! Go Watch Spider Man no way home if you really want some unexpected action. This movie is nostalgia and i felt like a kid again and see how much i grew with the matrix cast since it is still one of the best movie story back in 1999 and still is. Watching this movie is fun like driving an oldtimer and not lika a lamborghini. Somehow people think this is a bad movie even it was a 10 out of 10 priceless experience. Do not compare this with actual Marvel susperhero movies, dont worry one day Marvel will suck too and you want to live back in the days when you watched their movies before they started to getting boring.",10
3652,"I understand why people are disappointed in this. It lost its gritty grungy mindfudge. It feels much more like a super hero movie.But it is a nice gateway for the next generation to experience the matrix. And like the world, it is changed and new and though some of us morn the loss of what was,things will always move forward. And I'm glad this has been brought into the future.",7
3653,"It's... it's bad. Slow, convoluted, entirely too on the nose as if fans have forgotten key moments from the original; it's a long, boring mess. It took me 2 sessions to watch this as I couldn't make it through the film in a single sitting. It's a shame.",3
3654,"And was annoyed at the self awareness in the beginning of ""derpa derpy gonna churn these sequels out right? Haha"" but really didn't do anything beyond what it was mocking on it's face. I guess it could be a shameless revitalization cash-grab as long as it's self aware about it right..? Right guys..?This is complete with throwback scenes from the first films, literally just playing clips of the matrix movies at times, it's incredible the lack of grace the film has at reinventing and rebooting the franchise.The preview lead on that it was this subtle bleed of ""the real"" into the fake reality, leading a trapped Neo slowly realize something isn't right. Again no grace whatsoever, just throw Neal Patrick Harris in there (not that I hate him or anything), a blue haired chick that may as well have said ""come on grandpa let me show you around!"", new improved sexyman Morpheus and the endearing Mindhunter agent smith who would give you a hot cocoa after beating your ass and slap on some Jefferson Airplane and you got a hit baby!Again I have stated this, but the intro to the film is supposed to be like this nerdboner soup of self awareness, throwbacks, and nostalgia, but all I felt like it was was lack of creativity and willingness to take the story anywhere new.. almost anywhere at all for that matter. The first 70% of the film is a downright blur to me of nothingness and boredom. Pretty much zero story.Action sequences were surprisingly half assed and lackluster. I felt like the story wouldn't shine and was prepared for that actually but at least we would get that good old fashioned high budget Hollywood action.Gunplay was unsatisfying, bullets would create a white powder or dust effect on bodies. I had to check if they sold out and slapped a PG-13 on this... nope it's rated R, so I don't understand toning down the blood/gore to non-existent levels in the film. The fighting other than key moments was literally ""basic background characters fist-fighting"", I was totally done with it the minute it started, and waiting for it to end to get back to the ""story"".Odd choices were used in effects, they kept using this blurry slow-motion effect that seemed to lower the framerate, it came across as an extremely cheap movie maker type effect a high school student would use, it was genuinely that bad. Other effects used, called ""bullet time"" in the film to slow Neo down didn't feel as cheap but still was rather unsatisfying. I would have been really happy with a simple high framerate camera and slow motion effect of some real movements by the actors, shooting etc, it's not new but capturing something raw in high frames and high definition is a lot more compelling to me than cheap effects like the ones used.The only real redemption of the film was the last action sequence which was roughly 15-20 minutes, it is the only reason I'm even giving a 4 star rating, without that sequence the movie is a solid 2.The scenes action started much too clustered in the lobby but developed into multi vehicle chase scene with the ""bots"" chasing them on foot, the ""bots"" divebombing out of windows to try to stop the protagonists, protagonists weaving in and out from bad guys, cars, explosions etc. It's all been done before but honestly after sitting through the first part of the film this was incredibly relieving. It is what I was actually expecting from this movie the entire time but was constantly failing to deliver, now it was finally here! The last 20 minutes...It didn't need to blow my mind. I was prepared for it not to. It didn't need a revolutionary story. It didn't need to make me think about some deep philosophic implications and symbolisms for free will, determinism, and the choices we make. I was ready for some explosions, cheap action, and bullet shells pouring down on concrete like rain for a good hour or so for a fun ride with a scotch in my hand.Unfortunately I got neither in any satisfying dosage.I will be looking out for the next one though to see if it's any better than this and if it can develop a better story or just a better mindless fun Hollywood action ride.",4
3655,"Dialogs that treats you as stupid and action scenes that you'll forget a minute after.I loved the first movies, but this one seems an amateur attempt of recreating the original movies.",2
3656,"I just got back from seeing it in the theater. Jan 18After reading some super negative reviews today I almost didn't go see it. But I am glad I did. I thought it was pretty good, and it also made you think hard to follow some of the plot. Maybe the haters didn't like the complexity and mental challenge of the story.For sure it is a solid 6, and then two more points for being a Matrix movie with some good Matrix nostalgia.There was plenty of action, so not sure why one review I read complained about the lack of action. Maybe they were being sarcastic.I waited for it to be out a few weeks and there was hardly anyone in the theater. Or you can wait and watch it on DVD from your local library or online.",8
3657,"I think what bothered me most, is that Neo looked like John Wick. Other than that I enjoyed the movie. It's rather an adventure movie where hero saving his princess because they are in love with each other. I was alright with this. I am kinda fan of the original Matrix. Watched it multiple times and read stuff about it. I was not disappointed. Of course, I wanted a sequel of a different kind. But I can accept other points of views.I don't think the movie deserves the hate it's getting now. I don't know what the problem with those people.The best thing is that it's still a smart movie with deeper layers, links, easter eggs. I wait for people to analyze this and find explanations to many things happening in the movie. I remember some explanations helped me to understand things I did not realized in the first Matrix and helped me appreciate it very much.",9
3658,"Matrix excellent, Reloaded very good, Revolutions good. We all feared Ressurections would follow the rating trend, but hoped it would be something special. Sadly it followed the trend.It was nothing more than a means to make one last earnings from the franchise. The trailers gave the plot, and left nothing for you to guess.The plot was slow, not very sound, it left more conflictions than solved questions, and for me simply was an uneccessary story to tell. It simply wreaked of money grabbing from a great Franchise. Maybe Lana should sell it onto Disney, they'll sell it in their Franchise brothel along with everything else.It was great seeing Keanu and Carrie pick up their roles, along with a couple of others. The acting was good, the action scenes were on par if not a little more tame compared to the other movies.It was not a bad movie, but if you are going to jump on the back of a successful trilogy, sit at the table with the script for a little longer.",5
3659,"Of course, I've watched all The matrix movies and my favorite was the third part of the series, however this one doesn't disappoint at all.The action is a little bit confusing and you have to watch carefully, but in comparison with The Matrix: Revolutions, I'd say it's as good as the third part and definitely deserves a high rating.Great job!",9
3660,"I wanted to like this so bad, but it's just meh at best. As weak as the story is the effects and fight choreography are worse. You can see that each punch is missing it's target by a good 6-8 inches. It's hard to understand how 20 years later they could take a step back in the effects department. There's a strong low budget half thought out vibe to this movie. Keanu and Carrie still have it and the new blue haired girl with the old familiar rabbit tattoo was also good, but there were few if any other good actors in the film. The casting for Morpheus and Mr Smith was especially bad and so was their dialogue. Even Neo's powers were kinda lame. The last rooftop scene could have been good but it looked so fake. You could literally imagine the rope they were hanging from. If you're going to do a flying scene at least try to make it look somewhat real. The people saying this is better than 2 and 3 are out of their minds.",5
3661,"I'm a huge fan, the story, dialogue, action and acting. I never thought a 4th movie would do any movie justice, this movie proved me wrong. Everything about this movie makes sense to the story and answer so many questions on top of thinking out of the box in ways (I bet) fans never expected. Another amazing Matrix movie to watched again and again and again until we wake up from the Matrix ;)",10
3662,"So, the beginning is promising with a small follow-up scene after which everything turns into an exhibition for about 30 minutes and I became very confused. After that, it feels like a Matrix movie, but it's still missing something. The whole part with Trinity seemed silly to me, in the old trilogy ""The Chosen One"" was just Neo and now the movie is trying to tell us that without Trinity it's incomplete, idk seems to ignore everything that happened in the past and the end is exactly what I expected because yes we are in modern times. I forgot that Morpheus is in the movie, Smith was surprisingly ok and Bugs seemed like a really good addition! Overall I don't know why this movie exists, -6 for nostalgia and some good action scenes!",6
3663,"So I taking a different perspective to review the movie. While Matrix is purely FICTIONAL but just like the ""Terminator and Skynet and John Conner as the Chosen one"" - the prototype of these fictitious character is now being tested by scientists in vast majority of industrial like military and Space technology or nano technology in the hospital. I mean the technology and robotic digital AI being weaponize in military prototype.Matrix is our sort of Future MetaVerse in Scientific and technology perspective. This could be a alternate ""universe"" in the near future since the MetaVerse is now officially look to took shape more or like the Matrix world.Just like in the movie , I suppose the more we give up our freedom and rely on technology, digital world and robotic, we may end up just like in the Matrix movie. We lost our human freedom and big tech exploited it for profits.Most people dont realize that this is actually possible with the technology we had in our real world to create a larger facilities for a VR pod + hospital equipment to keep people livin inside their VR pod. While this hardly can be imagine nor understand beyond our human brain but I read few a medical paper research saying that our brain wave actually can create a 2D digital imaging just like the X-ray MRI or CT Brain scan used in the hospital.I just happy that I livin in 2000s and not in 2200s. Good luck with our future humanity.Because I hated robots, bots, virtual reality and argumentation reality and AI. I rate it 7 / 10.",7
3664,"This movie left me feeling like blade runner 2. What do I mean blade runner 2 was clearly set in the blade runner universe but it felt like you were watching a movie made by a fan where everything was just a little off and this new Matrix feels the same.A couple of things that stood out for me was the colour grading was missing, in the previous 3 movies they colour graded the scenes depending upon where the characters were which gave the trilogy a definitive feel, this movie didn't have it and it was noticeable. Also the action shots and fight scenes in the other movies were wide angle fairly long shots whereas this movie has the usual up close jump around camera bs that a lot of modern movies suffer from.I know this is from one of the original creators but they just seem to of missed everything that made the first trilogy great but a small amount.Also the concept for the story was decent it just wasn't that well executed. The new architect didn't feel like part of the machine world and neither did the Smith character, similarly we've had 3/4 movies already with the agents appearing with a very specific look and sound and now we don't and it's lost something. The action doesn't feel tense at any point it just feels directionless as does the plot. Like I said everything is just off what we've been given before and it doesn't work.Just goes to prove catching lightening in a bottle a second time isn't easy.Brian.",6
3665,"I wanted to like it but it's like listening to a child tell a story. They try to add so much but then skip parts so you aren't sure what's going on from time to time. Not much for plot and no real action. Hey, let's fight because we used to, then I'll help, then fight, but you won't know why.....",2
3666,"Where Larry and Andy once delivered an iconic crowd pleaser, Lana and Lily decided making a statement was better than letting someone else carry the torch. Like everyone else, I've been looking forward to this movie since it was announced. It was obvious early in the film they didn't want to do this movie at all. There's a whole scene early in the movie about Warner Bros forcing Neo to make a fourth installment to his successful video game trilogy (The Matrix) from 1999 that he swore he would never do. This is the Wachowskis telling the audience they didn't want to do this movie but didn't want to let anyone else do it either. This is when you should make the decision to watch something else. Literally everything is bad. The story is garbage, the casting and acting are awful (except for Keanu Reeves, of course), there's obvious plot holes, about 10% of the movie is just flashbacks to the original trilogy, and even the score seems muted and mediocre. Really just a complete disappointment and waste of time.",1
3667,"I don't know what I was expecting, but an unremarkable fan fic version wasn't it. Definitely don't waste your money (and health) in a theater, but if you're bored on your couch and you have HBO MAX, it's fine, or whatever.",5
3668,"It was a decent-ish movie with amazing visuals and a lot of sentimental references. It felt like Star Wars Episode VII, same story with much better CGI and some new actors.Apart from that there were two characters that were miscasted - agent Smith and the Analyst. Both characters did not click in the role.To summarise, the difference between original Matrix and its fourth instalment was this - first one was made by the Wachowskis brothers and the the (hopefully) last one was made by the Wachowskis sister(s).",5
3669,"The Problem remains the same: Choice. But only one can make the choice, the one who knows how important the choice is. All the others are only part of the matrix, which can be saved.",10
3670,"That's how I felt watching this movie. I am heart broken that this pseudo-movie exist. I knew it's gonna suck but I was at least expecting some fun moments and action. Lana, you and your sister are done in Hollywood. Thank you for the Trilogy which I loved - all of those movies. Seriously. I loved them. Despite some minor flaws, I felt like they were competent pictures. This one made me turn right and left on my seat, wanting to get out of the theatre. It was a waste of my time.",4
3671,"Don't waste your time. I saw it on someone else's HBO Max so it didn't cost me anything but even now, I still feel like I got ripped off. Started out BAD and got a tiny bit better then abruptly ended. If I could have given it zero stars, I would have.",1
3672,"Qualitywise, it's another Matrix sequel, not as good as the first one but still entertaining. It's worse than 2 but better than 3. The action is not that good though which is understandable because the actors are much older now. First act is pretty weak but it gets better. Overall i think with low expectations, you'll enjoy it but if you expected another Matrix 1 well ... get ready to be disappointed!I expected something as bad as Terminator: Dark fate but it wasn't like that.6.5 out of 10.",7
3673,"The beginning of the movie is very well centered, intriguing and keeps the attentino high; it is a very refreshing way of retelling the story of the first movie.Then, action comes into the movie and gradually but actually quite fastly turns it into a chaos with shots, freezed bullets and computer science jimbo-jumbo to quickly justify what's happening on the screen.A whole (shorter) movie entirely thought to explore the psichological aspects of the first movie would have been really great to watch.",6
3674,"Massive fan of the Matrix movies. I expected it to have great action sequences (which it did). I expected it to have all the usual gender politics, box ticking elements etc in it (which it didn't). Overall I thought this film holds up as a Matrix movie although not as good as the others mainly for nastoligic reseaons and the fact some of the characters were in it but with different actors playing them. Morpheus's character didn't really suit and was off from the originals. Some elements of the film I thought were put in for the younger audiences but overall was a mature movie. If your a Matrix fan I'd recommend watching it or a fan of action movies.",7
3675,"I want to help people to save the 2,5 hours of their lives. I'm just sad... They just replayed half of the first Matrix story was bad, poor Keanu doing stunts like he is 70 years old. Its obvious that this was just an attempt to do a quick moneygrab and cash in in nostalgia....",2
3676,I was excited to see this film. Maybe I built my expectations to high but it failed on every level for me. The special effects don't even measure up to the first one and that was over 20 years ago. The dialogue and acting were atrocious and the storyline fell flat. Unfortunately I can't believe that we will ever get another sequel to this franchise and that's a shame. There are so many stories that can be told about the Matrix and this mess is what we get? Do yourselves a favor and just rewatch the first one which is a masterpiece. This addition to the franchise is not worth the time.,4
3677,"What a disappointment...I hoped this film will carry some of the values and seriousness of the first movies. It did not... The whole story consisted of them trying to save Neo then Neo trying to save Trinity. I did not understand what was the message or the plot? Felt like a 14 years old wrote a fanfiction of Matrix after the 3rd movie and someone made that fanfiction into a movie. It almost felt like a parody of itself. Smith and Morpheus were really camp and did not carry any of the original seriousness. The new female character tried to do this...to some extend I appreciated her as it almost felt like she is the only one trying. The visuals were nice but the director absolutely overused scenes from the previous movies and literally put flashbacks in it so many times that it got annoying and almost embarrassing to watch.The only reason I am giving it 5 stars is because I loved the idea of the Matrix wanting to make Neo to think he was insane and the whole ""made my sickness into a game"" thing. It could have been a great movie with how it started. Such a shame it did not deliver due to the lack of plot.",5
3678,"OK loved loved it . Trying not to spoil it for anyone here that hasn't seen it yet but it's super epic love story between Neo and his great eternal love Trinity and it's action packed as well . I was thinking something kinda similar to the ending and kinda comes close . Again,without giving away too much away , one of the best scenes with one of the chief bad guys , Neo and Trinity just done phenomenally . Shows his great love for her .. even in the first part of the movie .. only one of the series that make me want to own it and make me rewatch the rest of them.ove love it and have watched it twice now . Some are hating that it's not in continuing the others a total break but naah I see it as a completing fullfilling it . Unfortunately they can't be bothered to have an open mind and still have an misunderstanding / misinterpretation of the series . 1) the love epic is always soo central to everything and as such even more so in the newest one 2) Trinity's was special not only was she a total badass in her own right but believed in Neo before he did as he admitted this 3) without Trinity there'd be no Neo 3) a lot of hidden meaning ( symbolism ) in the matrix comes full circle . 4) they each in turn saved each other's lives . Look at her saving him at rooftop scene after agent shoots at him and he callled her for help she goes up to agent's head and shoots him in the head "" Dodge this "" also when he's shot and flatlined she calls out to him telling hin she love shim . Also him saving her when she's been shot reaching in her and pulling bullet out and even massaging her heart . The new one Resurrection(s) Plural is both getting resurrected because she's also unique essential part of it all and whole trilogy is about his love for her and in new one , even when the whole world tells thenm they don't know each other never met thry're still rawn to each other . That's as agent Smith to quote him "" inevitably """,10
3679,"The good: TMR does a solid job expounding on the basic existential premise &amp; nostalgia of the original movie, being caught up in the desert of the real, the feeling of constant deja vu, creating the slow pacing of being on the treadmill of life, &amp; having been down that road before &amp; knowing where it goes, etc. Cinematography &amp; CGI we're also good. Storyline was ok, but finally kind of panders to the pc liberal crowd. Cameos were great, but it would have also been nice to see 'the spoon' kid, too.The bad: Keanu Reeves &amp; Carrie-Anne Moss live up to their roles, b/ the noobs just delivered sub-par performance, at best. I would much rather have seen Zendaya as Bugs, as opposed to Jessica Henwick. &amp; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II just doesn't give us that Morpheus, despite even his best effort, that Laurence Fishburne seamlessly &amp; flawlessly gave us. Perhaps, those shoes were just too big to fill. I found those 2 characters alone extremely lacking, as far as acting is concerned. Also, the fight scenes were just meh. Not as well choreographed as the 1st 3 movies.The ugly: Potholes galore! For example, Niobe does a horrible job explaining away what happened to Morpheus, like the audience is supposed to just buy that version of events. &amp; Smith... just completely repackaged, no explanation there, whatsoever. &amp; he just seemed to jump into a scene out of nowhere, via a bad camera angle, like a bad guy about to fight Chuck Norris, in a Walker Texas Ranger episode.Overall, I found the movie relatively entertaining. But unfortunately, it just doesn't generate the same hype the 1st 3 did. &amp; it certainly could have, had both the acting in the supporting roles (-2 stars) &amp; the story line been a smidge better (-2 stars). &amp; by better I mean less plot holes.",6
3680,"Speaking as a matrix fan, this film was like a tonight show parody.like an old characters 20. Year reunion. Worst of the worst scenario, bad acting, bad characters, bad choreography, bad system critisism, bad casting, no logic, no philosophy, Notting at all. There wasn't even one action scene to remember. The film was made only to Raise the woman power. Nothing more. This film was useful for showing only one thing, that the actual mind behind the matrix idea is andy/lilly wachowski. Total dissapointment for a matrix fan.",3
3681,"This is almost certainly a movie. It has actors, special effects, and titles. There are guns. Some people are bald, some are hairy. In conclusion, it is definitely a movie.",10
3682,"I can't believe it's done by so poorly and messy!Whole story is sooo messy confusing and visually bad, bad cinematography, bad casting in alot roles(except keanu, trinity etc), it's hard to follow the story if there is any. Its a total disaster! I wish I could erase my memory of this, it destroies the good memories of the originals.",2
3683,"Before watching/criticizing this movie one must ask as to they liked the trilogy? Was it because they liked the idea of matrix, the meta world of reality vis-a-vis a computer generated illusion of a reality? Or r u fan of the franchise for high quality action sequence/CGI. I am an ardent fan of Matrix trilogy because of the idea not mere CGI action sequences! If you want CGI, watch Marvel movies. The Matrix Resurrections is a long waited course correction by the makers. There is a reason why the architect/analyst/father are all men and the oracle is a woman. There is a reason why the makers have reimagined Trinity in a way that they have done in this outing. There is a reason why they have made this movie about Neo and Trinity and not just a war for survival between humans and machines. This movie is saying something very different from the original vision. I may not agree with their views but I do like/respect the symbolisms/views, which I am sure people will 'Wake up to' in years to come...",9
3684,"After seeing this with my father who saw the trilogy 16 times now, we were both satisfied. The action was cool and the plot was intruiging. The callbacks to the older movies were also pretty cool.Now, of course it isn't as good as the first movie, none of the sequels are. But I believe that this one is as rewatchable as the others.",7
3685,"Just watched it a second time and it gets better and better! The movie has so many layers to discover, if you are open-minded and want to engage in it. Do not watch it for pure entertainment!I can understand the disappointment and all the negative reviews, but this stems from watching too many dull movies in the past. Those movies, like many of the MCU movies, that just serve you something, you would expect and probably have seen many times before. You simply aren't used to watching a movie and have questions afterwards anymore. A movie, where you actually have to use your brain and rethink, what you just experienced.Surely this movie lags of what the other Matrix movies where all about, like huge action scenes, well-planned martial arts choreographies and creative camera tracking. It also has some dumb jokes and weird Disney-like robots, but this can be seen as a reflection of what movies have become. Like the last Star Wars movies, that were made by a company, owning the rights to this incredible universe, only wanting to maximize its profit.All in all this is well-played by Lana. She gave us another intelligent Matrix movie and did a brilliant job. Great fan service, social criticism and maybe the happy end this movie series deserved. Now it's up to Warner to continue or leave it be...",8
3686,I have never written a movie review but I felt so compelled to write one seeing as how disappointed I was. The story line although having some interesting plots was not great at all. If you're going to reboot a franchise like this which had such success in the 90's and captivated us with such out of this world concepts..its gonna have to be way better than this. Such a shame guys :/,4
3687,"I'm the original crowd - but I still enjoyed the movie quite a bit. It's NOT an action packed, cerebral, philosophical movie like the original Matrix was. It IS a story about mental health and love.I feel like a massive majority of the movie is the point of view of a schizophrenic trying to get help while feeling that all of the delusions and hallucinations are real and that the world is just trying to control them. Made me question why any of the schizophrenics I've worked with have ever trusted me. Maybe that ISN'T the message, but it's what I saw, and it's part of what kept me watching.The other part was the connection between Neo and Trinity. The strength and pervasiveness of it made me emotionally connect to both characters even more than the original. The switch of Neo being less of the individual savior of humanity and more of a partner with Trinity near the end, and him being HAPPY to have a partner in saving humanity made ME happy.In conclusion, this movie isn't for everyone. It's a definite change from the previous movies. People who have never seen the Matrix may be more likely to enjoy it. It's NOT a super action movie hell bent on reimagining how action sequences are done along with a deeper philosophy. It IS a visual treatise on love, mental health, power, and control with some action thrown in.",6
3688,"It's brilliant, creative, modern.Don't be afraid of recent trends in modern movies being 'applied' to this film. On the contrary, it's about being free of the system, once again.You will find quality in every aspect of the film. Thank God, a sequel that makes true homage to its roots. It's the Empire Strikes Back of the Matrix universe. Which is really great.",10
3689,"The effects are worst than the original one which had very decent graphics, the movie replaced a powerful cast with a bunch of teenagers and a clown playing the great morpheus, they even brought the clown from howimetyourmother to play a stupid character, the movie is super political in which a family life for trinity is mediocre dream, themes of feminism everywhere with distaint of children and replacing the chosen one with trinity.",1
3690,"It's a fact that when you decide to continue a legendary franchise, you should do it brilliantly, not in a ""pretty good"" way because doing so will automatically turn the movie into a disappointment for many people. The script wasn't bad but the way they show it was terrible. The worst thing about this movie is the action, which was the specialty of the Matrix franchise.",7
3691,"""Warner Brothers has decided to make a sequel to the original trilogy. They informed me they're going to do it with or without us."" This movie is largely a metacommentary, yes. The same stories keep being told and recycled but with new wrapping and new faces. The one thing that the filmmakers here understand is that there's a reason why some messages and stories persist through time and are retold. Call me a sucker, but one theme I'll keep coming back for is love.This is a love story...and it comes at a time during a pandemic when people need it most (albeit rough business move tacking it on a release slot soon after Spider-Man No Way Home lol). The majority of the film is tongue and cheek and it honesty feels like a little too soon to be looking back on the original trilogy with nostalgia-lenses...it's not THAT old. But if ol Warner was ordering a soulless reboot with just $$ in mind, I'm glad the artists (Lana Wachowski and co.) still got in there to leave their stamp. I'll keep coming back to hear new stories of love in all kinds of new wrapping - including neo-Matrix-style. Just please...don't reboot it again...lol.",7
3692,"It is impossible to imagine better than this, the participants in the manufacture of this film entered another level of art, congratulations on achieving the achievement of ""insult icon"".",1
3693,"How to ruin the legacy of a really good movie even more.It's just sad. Just because someone thought this series could be a cash-cow again, the slaughter the memory of the first movie.",3
3694,"Was nothing groundbreaking and rather quite light, but I still enjoyed it. It never goes to any true highs or lows but had this pretty steady light level to it. It lost some of its dynamic but strangely felt nice.I enjoyed the added depth to the world, even though it was mild. I liked how Neo and Trinity had been healed, but that exposition did last too long. I also liked how the Analyst kept them in a new Matrix. I thought it was clever to trick Neo into believing the Matrix was a video game he created. Almost a smart move to put the lie right in front of his face.Wasn't sure on the new Agent Smith. I like the actor but didn't feel we needed Smith again? Was funny seeing the Merovingian though.I loved the opening of the film as Bugs sees a ""remix"" repeat of the original opening. Did wonder if the new Trinity was a new Trinity or just some glitch in the matrix like the cat and they saw it repeating?The film does take a little while to get going, and while the exposition is perfect in the original film, here it is over-long and extended, especially with the Analyst. I would have liked to have seen more of Thomas Anderson having his own awakening, but not as much as Trinity's.For Trinity, especially as she lives with a husband and kids, I would have loved to see a strong story getting to know these other characters even if they are only programs and not real. It would have been really interesting to see some dramatic breakdown and realisation that these people are not her real family, and her children never existed. Instead it was rather subdued and like a shrug. But I didn't hate it either as my idea would have just taken longer.I liked the real world elements linked to the established world already created. For example, it never says how the real Morpheus dies so we can presume it was the same way as in Matrix Online. And perhaps how the video game ended was when the ""purge"" happened that was talked about in this. And maybe this new Morpheus can also be linked the the alternative AI of him that was created in Online? The machines working with the Humans fits well as characters attempted this in the final Animatrix short. Even some characters awakenings such as Bugs fits well with some Humans realising the world is a lie themselves, such as the athlete in the Animatrix too. Even the Machine world 01 is the opposite of the new Human world with IO. I liked all of this as it really felt connected and consistent, which a lot of ""reboots"" tend to fail at and there is almost something that makes me feel like the writers didn't even review their own script to see if it matches the original films. Here they obviously did in my opinion and was reallyResurrections isn't as dark as the original films and doesn't truly create many fascinating true characters (I do like Bugs though). But it does build upon the established world well and feels more like an answer to what happened to Neo and Trinity rather than a proper worthy overall sequel. The score is weak and action edited quite fast. But I enjoyed it for what it was and had a good time watching it.",7
3695,"Ladies and Gentlemen, First of all I want to say. That this was the biggest mistake in my life to watch This sorry excuse you people call a ""movie"". Thought It would get better after 1hr but ofc it didnt like other reboots the directors only want money so they dont give a damn about How the audience ""we"" would react when they approve garbage like this.. Second of all I dont want to disrespect anyone who may actually like it but anyway. They kicked their own bucket and I would be shocked if this ""movie"" hits the box office. All or most of the characters lost their sense of emotion, Morpheus acting like a total clown and the story was just an illusion to us viewers.I actually loved the first 3 Matrix movies than this hunk of junk.They should have just left the matrix alone..",1
3696,"The story line picks right off were is should and the plot is well developed and the action is well presented. I enjoyed the movie. Look forward to at lease two more in the future. As for the low ratings...don't let that stop you. If you enjoyed the first three movies this one will satisfy. In a world that can only type out sentences that are less than 140 characters, maybe this film was too long and complex to for the younger generation to follow. In the past I would tell these people to go back to school and learn something, but considering the crap they are teaching our new generations while not teaching them how to balance their checkbook, write on paper and use the library for research vs. The internet, that wouldn't help them.",10
3697,"It seems to be à la mode and easy to complain about the Matrix Resurrections, but I bitterly remember how the movie 2 and 3 had extreme weaknesses in sense and writing (albeit many aspects of the real/sensorial human city that were interesting and sometimes misunderstood I feel). In comparison to the enormous deception that were movies 2 and mostly 3, I really appreciated this ""resurrection"". The sense and writing were clearly superior. Also, for me, this new film had a lot of symbolic resonance. I like it.I presume our memory of The Matrix (I) stops a lot of people from just letting themselves be immersed and appreciate a different chapter and take on the story. Is it not also a sign that we have become so spoiled and saturated that we cannot appreciate decent (but not great) movies and give them horrible scores?",8
3698,"Can't believe it's got over 5 out of 10, I know it's one of those movies you have to watch but my days how bad was this movie? I'm find it hard to find the words to express how bad this movie is. I want a refund of me time so disappointed.",1
3699,"It's not a 10 star, but 9 stars indeed.CGI Was great, story was nice anot NOT BORING!This matrix continue from where the 3rd one endedAll together it's a great film! I really don't get why all the low ratings,Yes, neo is the one, there cannot be another ""the one"" this is the only bad part, Anderson was really good!THE MEROVINGIN WOW! Is it only me or it was an homage to month python's ""IT'S""????Anyway, sorry, this film is great, and please watch and decide for yourself.... I had huge expectations and came here and was bombarded with bad reviews, so my expectations was lowered, but brah, it was great!Thanks for reading ;)",9
3700,Best sequel in the series! Super smart and true! People that tend to be superficial will not like it...people that are connected with their inner feelings will love it!,10
3701,"I was so looking forward to this movie, since I'm a big fan of the previous editions. However, this thing stinks! It's poorly written, poorly acted and a terrible production. Did they shoot this thing on their iPhone??",3
3702,When both the sisters worked together to make the matrix movies they were good but idk why lana would make this movie with out her sister her sister was also the creative one without her she is nothing its sad but its true my bf and i can't even finish watching the new matrix movie she turned it into a joke.,1
3703,"The film is brilliant, but now it will not be properly appreciated, the film requires the ability to think and analyze, and ""you can't force anyone to sit with a notebook and a pen"", because films ""should be bright and stupid""! The director foresees this - the scene after the credits speaks about it, humorous and even with a great deal of sarcasm. Great direction, great music, masterpiece phrases! Everything that interferes with the perception of the essence is relegated to the background (for example, blurred battle scenes). The names of the heroes, as always, saying, the game is excellent. This is essentially a release instruction. Many thanks to Lana Wachowski and everyone who made the film!",10
3704,It was Genocide!! They just destroyed the original!!! Horrible cast!! Awful director!! What French man was doing exactly. Just don't watch it. It must be remove from film history. I'm so disappointed!!,2
3705,"After finishing the movie, I feel like I've eaten reheated pasta: I still have a taste of the original dish, but the experience was just bad.The overall plot of the movie is decent. It doesn't feel like a heartless cash-grab, but the execution does.* The movie is littered with sequences from the old movies (which I found very tacky), as well as over-explanations. The best thing about the original movies was that it made you think. It made you keep processing what you've just seen for a lot of time.* The Matrix movies felt cold and serious. They were about serious issues, there was no silliness in it. There was no room for it. The silly atmosphere and lines just make some things feel gross. Any attachment that you feel to the characters is reset to 0 in that moment.* Fight scenes are sub-par.* 3rd wall breaks are ok if you set them up correctly. These were not. Sometimes it felt like the director just watched Deadpool and said ""I want some of that"".I think the best thing that could have been done in post is just not name it ""Matrix"". Name it something like ""The adventures of resurrected Neo"" or something. The movies doesn't do justice to itself or to the original trilogy by latching itself to them. It's fine if you want to do something different. But don't raise expectations by packaging it in nostalgia.",6
3706,Lame action that looks like a CW show. Terrible dialog. Set pieces were not impressive. Lack of proper action scenes. The meta described at the begin sets the ton for the rest of the movie. Not sure what happened at the end of the film. Pay attention there's 2 helicopters and 1 straight up disappears into thin air with no explanation.The actors did well.,1
3707,"I preferred to see the Matrix Resurrections on IMAX format rather than on the smaller screen. I did not regret watching it at the cinema, but I already had low expectations before going to the cinema. I appreciate the effort to push the story forward instead of restarting the series as a reboot, but there's just too much nostalgia for the movie and it isn't a good thing for a movie that progresses the story forward. Let's start with the positive aspects of the movie first.The first half of the movie was much more interesting for me as it fed the curiosity of the audience while Neo trying to get rid off the loop. On other hand the second half of the movie does not maintain this curiosity effectively.I can appreciate the movie's special effects, but they're not as groundbreaking as the first Matrix movie from 1999. 18 years passed since 3rd Matrix movie, the visual and special effects have improved further and this has contributed to all the high-budget movies. Also, the Matrix Resurrections benefited from this condition.I must say Keanu and Moss still have chemistry, plus Jessica Henwick, who plays ""Bugs,"" is the best new character that was added to the movie, giving a very impressive performance. On the other hand, I missed Hugo Weaving and Lawrence Fishburne so much, the new castings were not enough to fill their shoes. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is not a big disappointment as Morpheus but you still looking for Laurence Fishburne. When you hear Jonathan Groff's Smith says ""Mr. Anderson,"" you realize something is missing because of the Weaving performance in the trilogy. Also, the motivations of some characters' actions are not very clear, like Smith and Niobe. It doesn't look like a full movie and the ending didn't satisfy me. Finally, the choreographies in the action sequences don't even come close to the trilogy as they are so dependent on CGI but they are not bad. In short, it's a mediocre movie, but still slightly better than its current IMDB rating. Matrix fans can see it at the cinema because after all years seeing a new Matrix movie is a dream that comes true for them. Keeping expectations low will decrease the hugeness of disappointment.",5
3708,"I don't usually leave reviews, but I'll make an exception for this one. A disaster movie (literally).The plot is all over the place. The movie misses the atmosphere and look of the original ones. I feel main actors like Laurence Fishburne ran away screaming after reading the script. Average acting, average special effects (that don't feel special). Quite a disappointment for anyone who paid to see this movie. To sum it up: avoid.",2
3709,"Sometimes it pays to know when to let go..when to hang up one s bootsThe Matrix was one of the movies that defined a generation... the script, the casting, the jaw dropping CGI for the time, the sheer spectacleEverything this movie summarily lacks!This movie tried to live in that past glory - from snippets of the old films to the flailing casting of the lead pairThe original script inspired us to integrate elements into our cultural references. This one leaves us scratching our heads. A disjointed, cliched, uninspiring effort at best and an inept marketing driven focus group mash up at worstIn the era of the marvel cinematic universe , the CGI looks or for the course and cannot carry a bad scriptFinally, the casting. Apart from the obvious Keeanu and Carrie Ann, who have done more than was asked of them, the rest of the cast just does not fit the characters.. After iconic portrayals of Morpheus and Smith by Mr Fishbourne and Hugo Weaving, this really rankles and strips the movie of the gravitas the originals oozedFrom clear editing gaffes and visible dubbing mistakes, and sub par, near creepy( not in a good way) performances, the suspicion of monetary gain from a zombie franchise seems to fester throughoutAlmost as if the executives made the artists do this at gunpoint..and a cry for help in the movie actually admits to thisThe fortitude of the artists would have demanded a stern NO..Instead, the fantastic original now stands desecrated!",4
3710,"Visually stunning and the concept for why it's been so long is interesting. The story however doesn't keep your attention at times and there is little character development for the new characters, which is unfortunate because Jessica Henwick (Bugs) gives a great performance. I just didn't feel the same sense of enjoyment watching the film as I did the previous installments.",6
3711,"This movie was like watching a slug cross a bridge. You think eventually you will get to a successful ending, but it just keeps dragging on with no real action or excitement. I wouldn't.purchase this movie if it was in the $5 bin at Walmart.",1
3712,"THE SET UPDecades after the events of Matrix 3, Neo is once again Thomas, inside the Matrix after the M-3 reboot, and struggling with reality and existential crisis with the help of a therapist and pills. Reeves is quite good at playing nervous wreck Thomas. Some humans from outside the Matrix break through to reach Thomas /Neo.The setup and following events similarly mirrors M1 and does so fine. No new ground is really covered although for those unfamiliar with M1-3 (or if like me you don't remember M2-3 well) this can be watched as a rebooted stand alone. Although if you do know M1-3 there's plenty of links and bridges to the previous films world building.The major flaw in this film in my opinion is the lack of Weaving, Fishburne and new plot direction. The biggest is Weaving's absence.Agent Smith- I mean THE Agent Smith is in this film but portrayed (satisfactorily) by another actor. The problem is Weaving OWNED that role and perfectly portrayed robotic menace. The new guy didn't. This really bugged me (haha bugged) the whole film. Also it's not clearly explained why THE Smith is back in the Matrix after the M3 reboot.Morpheus was not Morpheus. Although its kind of explained. As another reviewer said, it was kind of a mockery of OG Morpheus.As the film is basically M1 rebranded with shiny new characters, backstory etc - there's not much in the development of the saga plot. M1 was Free Neo. M2 was find the Oracle and Source. M3 was fight the machines and win freedom. M4.... Back to zero?The film was good. The effects were good. Reeves was good. It was all enjoyable - it was just not groundbreaking like the original series.",7
3713,"Like morpheus said no one cay tell you this movie is bad or good you have to see it for yourself! It has lots of nostalgia in it as the fans want, enough action and thriller but not too deep as we expected...still harsh criticism towards today cinema so it is understandable why critics dont like it much and also the message of the movie is not likeable for everyone but that is what matrix wants to do! Free your mind not please it...",8
3714,"Strictly judging the movie itself, without comparison to the original, it was not disappointing. The plot was good, the acting was great, awesome scenes, very entertaining. That stated, nothing beats the original Matrix.",8
3715,"Man. The hate this movie is getting is mind boggling to me. I saw it in IMAX today and loved every second of it. Super entertaining, full of action, and packed with great story. The first half of the film reflects the original a lot, but there's purpose to that. And I thought it was very well executed. The second half is completely original, and offers up new, exciting ideas. I loved the new characters and enjoyed the fact that there was some comic relief and personality as opposed to the typical robotic dialogue that the first three installments relied so heavy on. I don't know, man. Lighten up. It was a really solid movie. See it. Enjoy it. Have fun with it. That's what a movie like this was meant for.",9
3716,"Went in with a lot of expectations and hope, but never imagined that I'd walk out of the theatre halfway into the film. This film is an enormous waste of talent, money and franchise. This is a sequel that was absolutely unnecessary and millenials who would be watching this as the first matrix film of their lifetime would laugh at the fame the previous trilogy had. I can't even imagine a good reason why stalwarts like Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss even signed up for this! The film is at best a low budget cheap thrills type and doesn't have any of the important traits of a good movie - acting, storyline, action or visual effects. Such a massive letdown.",1
3717,It's not good as old movie it's boring more conversation less action sequences but ok ok movie. But u need patiance to watch it u really get distracted while watching.Interesting part is less and boring part is more in the movie.,5
3718,"I'm not sure why so many write negative reviews. Most of the negative are actually positives. I've been a huge fan of Matrix movies and seen them all in the theater. If there was a problem with this, I definitely would be writing a negative, but I'm not.This is a psychological movie more than action. Pretty much like the first film and highly amplified. The more I watch this film, the more I appreciate the psychological references and usage of it within the story and how it was used to bridge the years between the 3rd and 4th movie.Sure, it uses a lot of flashbacks, but one needs to think that it has been nearly 20 years since the originals ended. There is a whole generation that has never seen the originals and are just now jumping in. I feel that it was tastefully done, not only to help newbies understand, but it gives more emotion and depth in his confusion and fight for what is real.The usage of making him the creator of the matrix video game gives it so much more depth. In the words of Morpheus, ""Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony."" For Neo, Trinity, and agent Smith. You would understand the more you watch the movie.I hope all this ignorant backlashing doesn't prevent them from making more. Given the chance, they will be more action oriented like the previous 2 movies. They're just warming up.",10
3719,I loved the first 3 parts of Matrix and my husband and I were really excited to finally watch the 4th part after so many years. But it was dissapointing! Way too much of liberal views have being adopted into this movie and they just couldn't leave it alone. The storyline was just too much and less action to how Matrix is suppose to be.,5
3720,The idea is great and compared to most of what's out there it is entertaining but there are so many questions I have. Why is the non matrix so dreadful looking? Why do they have to go back into the matrix all the time? Mostly just questions but I still was thrilled by it.,7
3721,"It misses the chemistry of the trilogy. I expected so much more from the producers, director and actors.I am hoping I am in the the Matrix and this movie isn't real.",2
3722,"The Matrix: Resurrections is the most recent attempt to reboot the franchise that was so important to the zeitgeist of the turn of the century, and boy did it disappoint.I truly wanted to like this movie, especially because I did not care for the last two films from the original Matrix trilogy. I thought the first one was groundbreaking, the second one wasn't as good but still worth the watch, and the third was a complete waste of time and Jada Pinket-Smith.So when word came out that Lana Wachowski was going to make a fourth film I was hopeful. I mean, if anyone can pull it off it's her right? However, watching it on HBO Max over the Christmas holiday weekend, I think Lana should have brought her sister onboard, if anything than to pull the collective head out of this film's collective arse.Yes, it's meta; yes it's self referencial, and yes I did enjoy the not-so-subtle references to consumerism being the great downfall of our times (the line about ""sheeple"" was particularly excellent). It was so busy patting itself on the back that it forgot it still had to entertain and make sense.I did not appreciate the total and complete lack of any kind of story, or deeper meaning. They rehashed all the fight sequences almost shot for shot, and the new group of ""woke"" young people helping Neo (Reeves) and Trinity (Moss) look like what old people think young people look like at an all night rave. So much black pleather and hair gel!I don't know why they brought the Morpheus character back either, especially because it's not Laurence Fishburne (played instead by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). If everyone in the original trilogy dies, and they can bring all them back with the stroke of a keyboard, why did Morpheus get recast but Neo and Trinity did not? They clumsily explain all of this away, while introducing the Gen Z cast mates, whom I felt nothing for. I didn't care for any of these characters, the stakes were almost non-existent and the ""peril"" they faced felt like BS fan service that did not excite me, or make me care any more about what was happening on screen.If you liked the second and third Matrix movies, I'm sure you will enjoy this one as well, but if you're a purest like me, do yourself a favor and grab a bottle of booze to wash down your disappointment and white hot anger before you sit down to watch this cash grab unfold before your eyes.Like I said at the start of this review, I really wanted to like it, but alas the Hollywood reboot machine has spit out another expensive, unnecessary and disappointing sequel. But at least it's better than the last Indiana Jones.",3
3723,"Easy to rate the first three.10/10, 9/10, 7/10People weren't kidding when they said this was meta. This is about as meta is it gets. I thought I was watching a behind the scenes documentary at some points. At least at the beginningSome minor woke bits, nothing too serious. (But seriously making the main bad guy misogynist, it just doesn't make sense)Still has cool philosophical ideas in it. This is why you shouldn't always trust reviews. Some people just see what they want to see, but it wasn't their choice, they were always going to react like that just as I was always going to defend itl.Not all of it makes perfect sense but it's a movie, they don't have to. You need to suspend your disbelief and enjoy it for what it is.Also enjoy the whole idea again of is this reality or is this the matrix and you're being manipulated and held captive.Very different approach and style to the original 3 but that's ok.I always find these is it vr/matrix or am I going crazy fascinating. Ultimately how does anyone ever know, it's impossible. We just have to live our lives with the best evidence available until something else comes along to sway you, and even then there's actually no way of knowing. This film still gets my philosophical juices going.Would have been nice to have a higher purpose main objective (on top of saving trinity) like coexisting with machines or bringing them down etcAnd of course the metaphor of the matrix being the double speak and thought police that institutions place on us instead of seeing the world as it really is and our freedoms that we think we have and if you take a step backwards there's actually very little freedom even in the western world still holds true.There is something missing from this film. A je ne sais quoi and feel to the old ones that doesn't seem to be present in this, maybe it's nostalgia (i don't mean that this film doesn't constantly remind us of how special the trilogy was, just that it's new so can't ever be what the old movies were to us, yet).Not really a fan of the heist style at the end where the plan is talked through and we see the plan in action in little snippets that cut back and forth.Nothing particularly new or special but a decent film in its own right.Went from an 8/10 to 7/10 then the ending almost brought it back up to an 8.Seems to be missing some of the nuance and magic of the others but still as good as the third which was pretty average.Maybe one too many call backs.",7
3724,"This movie has nothing to do with Matrix trilogy, Matrix genre, dynamic, iconic fight scenes or the general spirit of Matrix. This is pure fanfiction of someone who ""shipped"" Neo and Trinity and imagined a story that would bring them back. And as fanfiction it has it's own qualities. But this is not Matrix. And I guess the reason that Keanu and Carrie-Anne agreed to make this was nostalgia. And it was nice seeing them again together.",3
3725,"It was with the 2021 movie ""The Matrix Resurrections"" from director Lana Wachowski. Of course, with the popularity of the original trilogy, then I can understand why they wanted to cash in on this franchise. But come on...",6
3726,What you want from a Matrix film:-Great set design-Great action scenes-Emotional Rollercoaster induced by great acting-Something new and iconic-Cool dialogueI'm telling you: this movie delivers!This is why people come to a cinema and this is how cinemas can stay alive.,10
3727,"Ok, just finished watching it... I will proceed without spoilers so don't worry..This is gonna be super divisive especially for fans of the original, but I liked it quite a lot .It has issues, bare in mind, I say this as someone who ranks matrix 1 as one of my favourite ever movies, but even through my rose tinted specs, there is far FAR to much fan service in this... It's literally referencing the original every 2 minutes....I really like the way Lana wachowsky reinserted all the characters back into the story, it was well done, real 4th wall inside a 4th wall stuff ..A solid 8/10 from me, but I suspect it will be review bombed Hard... It'll deffo have some spicy reviews.",8
3728,The bar was set pretty low following the standard of the second and third Matrix films. This latest effort was easily able to limbo under it. I still rate the first one highly but this was just a pointless revisit.,3
3729,"Tried to watch it with open mind, taking into consideration « Maybe Lana wanted to showcase « « this... or that ... »In the end a PAIN to watch, everything Matrix was, is and should be about was broken.",2
3730,"As a lifelong fan of the trilogy, I absolutely loved the new film. Packed with nostalgia but exciting in new ways! Both Neo &amp; Trinity and the new characters were wonderful to watch. Familiar soundtrack, relevant storyline, great action sequences, never boring. It all made sense to me. My only complaint is I would've loved to see Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne reprise their roles. Neil Patrick Harris was entertaining as hell as the Analyst. Definitely worth a watch or ten!",10
3731,Crap movie filled with woke propaganda. Thank you Larry Wachowski for ruining a beautiful franchise.My thoughts are Keanu was constrained to play in this movie by some long forgotten clause WB added on the footnotes of the contract he signed.The cinematography was subpar and visual effects looked like were created by amateurs.I'm really disappointed that Keanu Reeves took part of this.,2
3732,"The stupidest act ever. Terrible acting as well as the initial idea of matrix was ruined. Even the first matrix was based on talks, it made a lot of sense. This one, does have a lot of talking which is so stupid and pointless.",1
3733,"Set might be isn't that bad. Everything else is. Poor casting, poor directing, poor actor play, poor effects, poor operator work, poor montage, poor dialogs, poor marketing. Totally unprofessional.",5

3735,"....And it was not even 11:00 pm. I am glad we (I) watched on HBO Max... Otherwise we would had spent about $40 USD on tickets and popcorn. The movie is worth $4 USD not $40. I Guess $2.00 USD per star I am giving it. Really disappointed,",2
3736,"The Matrix ResurrectionsWell except the producers who surely had dollar signs instead of eyes ... although why anyone thought it was a good idea to release this a week after Spider-Mans No way home is beyond me. That could never work ... not just because of the pandemic we are still fully experiencing.I understand people being dissapointed. We have romantic views of things of the past, even more so in times like these. No I'm not trying to put you in a bad mood. We are all in this together - no pun intended. Having an escape like the Matrix ... I reckon some would choose to go and take the blue pill(s). If they were offered to them.Add to that recasted ... fans were not smitten when they heard that Laurence Fishburn was not ... reprising his role. Hey I don't remake these words up, they already exist - I am just reusing them. Ok I'll try to stop - maybe, let's just ... return to the movie...Accept this for the campy trip it is supposed to be, be happy for the new generation that can enjoy a Matrix movie, and try to enjoy this romp with great visual effects. Also stay through the credits for a bonus scene - and if you like it or not, the Matrix probably will always return in one way or another ...",8
3737,"I don´t know why they made this movie, because it seems to me that they wanted to create something new, but that is not always the best thing!I think they will continue this movie franshise, but they have a bad start..rent it if you want to see it .",5
3738,"GUYS TRUST ME. I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. MY REVIEW MATTERS THE MOST HERE, I KNOW KEANU PERSONALLY AND HE IS SITTING NEXT TO ME WITH A GUN POINTED AT MY HEAD. WHAT IS THERE NOT TO LOVE HERE? BEAUTIFULLY MASTERFULLY DONE ACTION SCENES THAT RIVALED ALL FIRST THREE FILMS COMBINED, EVERY LINE OF DIALOGUE WAS JUST PERFECTLY DELIVERED WITH SO MUCH DEEP COMPLEXITIES, THE MUSIC BROUGHT SUCH INTENSITY AND EXCITEMENT TO EACH SCENE I SIMPLY COULDN'T HANDLE IT. NOT A SINGLE BORING MINUTE! I WAS ON THE ABSOLUTE EDGE OF MY SEAT FROM START TO FINISH, I ALMOST CRIED AND SCREAMED FROM THE SHEER BRILLIANCE OF WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING. I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED WHEN THE CREDITS ROLLED. I HAD JUST WITNESSED GOD LIKE LEVEL FILMMAKING. MY EYES AND EARS WERE NUMB FROM THE SHOCK. I NEEDED A BREATH OF FRESH SO BADLY I WAS SUFFOCATING AND FELL TO THE FLOOR, MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS CALLED 911 TO WHEEL ME OUT OF THE THEATER. I WAS THAT BLOWN AWAY GUYS. I MIGHT HAVE PERMANENT HEART PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF THIS INCREDIBLE MOMENT THAT I KNOW WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. I FEEL FINALLY COMPLETE IN MY LIFE AFTER WATCHING MATRIX 4. IT HAS HEALED ALL MY TRAUMA AND PAIN FROM ALL MY PAST LIVES AND MADE ME A COMPLETELY NEW WHOLE PERSON TODAY. PLEASE I BEG OF YOU, BEFORE KEANU PULLS THE TRIGGER, WATCH THIS GENIUS WORK OF ART RIGHT NOW!! YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!!",10
3739,Honestly disappointed isn't even adequate a term . Wish the brothers had to direct this and it may have been amazing like the predecessors. The initial start was different and a little off track of where I imagined this film would take me and why couldn't they use Lawrence? Curious .,5
3740,"I am tired of all of the Disney crap out there, this movie the pretty good to complete this saga. Carrie-Anne Moss and Neo did there role great it was fresh to see them again. And the graphics were enhance in this matrix and Zeon looked awesome now with it's sky.",9
3741,The fourth installment of main character finally putting on sunglasses by the end of the movie with a side of something something matrix blah blah blah. Ohhh the guy who was in speed with sandra bullock is in this.,5
3742,"The original franchise was a revelation. It had character, groundbreaking action, an iconic score... a true identity. It left a dent in cinematic history. This movie had great potential to continue this path yet redefine it. I actually particularly liked the plot, the direction it was going in toying with this idea of ""breaking the 4th wall"". It offered commentary and references and respect to its predecessors. The story was compelling. However... it was a very flawed execution. I'll leave it at that.Thank you for the original films, especially the first two... this made me appreciate them significantly more.",5
3743,"As an ode to the 90s spoof movies ""Not Another Teen Movie"" and ""Not Another Scary Movie"", Matrix 4 should be re-titled to ""Not Another Matrix Movie"" being so bad its comes off as a bad SNL skit of a Matrix Movie. Seriously, they trolling us?",2
3744,"Hello all, no spoilers to the movie or any plot descriptions here in my review. However, you will read about my criticisms of these so called ""Movie Critics"" on these app. I read every single review of the Matrix by these so called ""Movie Critics"". Know what I found out, if I believed their reviews, I would have missed out on an awesome movie. When the 1st Matrix was released in '99, I was 24 and watched it in the movie; while most of these critics were not alive or to young to remember and base their reviews on watching the DVD releases or the sequels. Either way, if you believe everything you are told in life or what you see on the internet, then you will miss out on an excellent movie.If you read these ridiculous reviews from critics who have absolutely no credentials whatsoever, but feel their opinions are what matters...sorry for you.",10
3745,"For me nostalgia and seeing them together again, played a big part in liking this movie. Its not a bad movie and has some great scenes.Obvious issue is lack of any sense of danger, what original movie did brilliantly, killing off the characters, to show the dangers of Matrix, that battles and bullets in Matrix matter to the real world, that people actually die.This movie totally lacks thatNone of the battles or bullets matter as no one dies and there is no sense of danger, I don't know why, as very little has been done on character development of lesser characters.Il still watch the next one.",7
3746,"The film is not worth attention at all. Very sorry for the actors who were drawn into this absurdity, I hope that not of their own free will, but only because of their past involvement to the film. As for the new faces, I don't understand why they agreed to this. Lana Wachowski said that she came up with the story in one and I believe her, because it is clear from the first minutes of the film.",3
3747,"Niobe: ''For the first time, we saw machines at war with one another..""That line alone has a potential for a good matrix spin-off.War of the machines from the real world... The fall of zion.I sooo wish to see that, i think the story would be very interesting. Neo's conversation with granny naobi can really spark brilliant spin-off from this movie.",5
3748,"This is a great example of how 2021 Hollywood is a watered down version of Hollywood 20,30 or 40 years ago... The original Matrix was a ground breaking, out of this world movie that won 4 Oscars and it looked something nobody has ever seen before. 22 years later (time really flies) we have this. We have a scifi action thriller turned into romance, scifi-ish drama... We have Morpheus which looks and acts like a pimp, Neo who has became some sort of Marvel superhero and who didn't have a dialogue longer than 3 sentences in the entire movie, we have agent Smith who is now a posh CEO and Trinity that didn't age well at all. As a bonus we have a group of nerd game developer team who are I assume vegans who identify themselves as they/them because political correctness (and the movie tries really hard to make sure we are aware of their life choices). The mere fact that I, as a big fan of this franchise who saw all of the movies several times, didn't even know that this movie is being made until a few weeks after it was officially released, because Hollywood hyperproduction. I give it 6 stars, but it actually deserves only 4, I added two extra for nostalgia reasons only.",6
3749,This movie felt so half assed. Like a syfy channel series remake. I was initially excited when I heard there was a 4th matrix movie but after watching it I can honestly say this is one of the most pathetic additions to any movie franchise in recent times. I wonder if the directors were forced to make the movie because that's how it seems.,1
3750,"It felt like a fan-made movie with cheap fighting sequences and some bad acting. It was all over the place and not focused on anything enough to make it meaningful.The only think i liked about this movie was Carrie-Anne being in it. She was the only one that actually tried to make it work. Keanu was so-so but other than that, meh.Bugs was given quite a role but personally i think she took too much screen time. Explanations were not delivered well. The seriousness was never achieved due to some characters trying to crack a joke abruptly and I was really annoyed about keep seeing references and old scenes in every 5 min.Like i said, it was like a fan-made movie with really low budget and little creativity.I'll try to be happy thinking atleast Neo and Trinity are together again.",3
3751,"For the entirety of the film I wasn't sure what universe is this, because it didn't seem like matrix to me. Where is the iconic green hue? This honestly feels like the directors copied scenes from the first movie just to appeal to our nostalgia for it. In reality the story makes no sense, who is the main protagonist? Doesn't seem like Neo, I guess Trinity? But she didn't do anything the whole film. Who is the antagonist, what are the fighting against since they live so happily among the robots? What was the point in saving neo and trinity? All these questions arise from the lack of good story building.Its just another sequel that shouldn't have been made. If I'm gonna rewatch the matrix I'm leaving this movie out of the trilogy.",6
3752,Until there is nothing else left. How much bigger can you make things? Doesn't mean they will be beautiful.And characters as through have not aged or even aged backwards. The last scene is quite literally appalling. It's as though 20 year old in 40 year old body. And did they really have to even kill metaphors that were so beautiful in original?,4
3753,"The Matrix is a masterpiece. A movie with an extremely well written story and amazing actors. Every scene is an iconic one, and it put cinema as an art.And then, 22 years after, there is this atrocity. Probably one the worst movie I've seen in the past few years. Everything, from the scenario to the music, and even CGI, is wrong or worse.Here is a short review of a movie, that is a torture to every Matrix fans.The movie start with a new team, which seems ok but far from the charismatic one we have before. Then, almost from the first few minutes, flows are coming from all ways : the scenario is over complicated, with a lot of technical terms which, even for enthousiasts, mean nothing... Music is generic, and the only time it makes you chill is when they use the original score.Fights are unimpressive, every acrobacies are in slow motion, which makes the all very slow paced. Gunfights are ridiculous, with absolutly no friendly causualties dispite those beiing shot multiple time. Again, blood is scarse and nobody gets killed, it's a family show.The « outter world » is also a bad, very bad mimic of every dumb utopian world we have in films nowadays : robots are friendly and programs can talk through some steel balls ? Oh and obviously there are plants and a silly sky, every thing is biological and ethic, y'a know.And all of that is going on and on during more than 2 and a half hour...Finally, there is Keanu Reves. Whoah... how deep are you going to go Keanu ? After the steal of Cyberpunk 2077 you sell again a pack of s....t and are ok with it. You didn't even cut your hair in most of the scene because you were shooting John Wick 4 and 5 ?This is all wrong, and I ´m afraid for those upcoming movies, are they going to be that bad ?There is one positive point though : sometime, or a lot of time in fact, they show part of the original trilogy. And oh my, those are so goods.",1
3754,"The movie trailer is better than the movie.The trilogy has been successfully distorted.Poor movie story.It does not contain excitement or suspense, but rather you feel bored and frustrated while remembering the greatness of the old parts.",4
3755,"The viewers are literally called sheep and are being mocked throughout the film. Except of course of those who don't resonate with reality as it is, which reality the new Matrix is mirroring very well, especially in the scenes where the said swarm attacks the people that want to change it. Great b-movie aesthetics glue everything together and butthurt anyone who becomes emotionally attached to commercial products such as movies. Minus two points for the new Smith though.",8
3756,"They destroy the elegance of the Matrix it's to much color in the clothes Morpheus looks like the joker and agent smith dresses like going to the mall and the captain doesn't look like is taking things serious, the general looks to old, Keanu reeves is excellent and Trinity great, everybody else it's great but they need to make a 5 movie to fix and bring back the elegance of the Matrix the true art of the movie. Take things serious because what's flipper doing in the matrix and the zombie apocalypse.",9
3757,"Personally, I thought it was clever how they were able to continue the story of the Matrix. I was iffy on some explanations but they come together cohesively by the end. I didn't think it was as near as hard to follow as the Architect convo from Matrix Revolutions was. I thought the first 45/60 minutes were pretty entertaining. There is some use of previous footage but I honestly don't think they used too much, and that was a big concern of mine going in. The previous reviewer is wildly exaggerating by saying it takes up half the movie. I love the song ""White Rabbit"" and they may have pulled of the coolest use of it ever. So I give them a lot of props for that big time. After that montage I was so excited for the rest of the movie...For me it derails pretty quickly at about the halfway point. After that, some of the fighting sequences were pretty subpar for a Matrix film. They seem to escape danger by simply cutting frames too. They'll be completely surrounded and then next scene they're running into a building as if we're supposed to only remember 10% of the enemies. It's almost silly.It also becomes quite clear that this film another movie trying to push a (somewhat) feminist message. You can read my other reviews and see I'm not just some guy that says that every time. By the end of this film, they basically want you to believe that Neo was as powerful as he was because of Trinity. Then they go even further and basically make HER the powerful one.All in all it's worth the watch, but I wouldn't have been stoked if I had paid $20 at a theater. I'll watch sequels as well BUT probably wait until they're streaming.",6
3758,"Ok, first I wanted to enjoy this move. I liked the original trilogy, so I went in with hope for this. Sadly, the biggest they I can say is that is was...mmeehh!Way to many beats from the original movie. I felt like this was simply a rehash of the original movie with a few character alterations. Felt as though Keanu didn't want to be in this.Please Hollywood...original movies or at least a great script before resurrecting a franchise because this one certainly didn't need it or deserve it.",4
3759,"This was a total matrix reboot and it did not maintain any Matrix originality. Which is fine , it is not fine if one has the predispositions of the first three movies.I hope they make another one. The theme of the movie definitely was correlated to the theme of the first movie. The idea that everyone is comfortably nested into a fake made world. How ever this matrix was like a re nesting rather than a nesting of the mind. It eerily represents psychology and the reality we exist in but it is not uncommon for Hollywood to do that. It is disconcerting though that they use reality as a form of entertainment but I guess it works.",6
3760,"Had such high expectations. 20 years on and the technology/special effects would be even more amazing - it was so disappointing. The fight scenes were blurred and confusing. Neo and Trinity nearly pulled it off as actors on their own, but with Mr Anderson and Morpheus missing (the original actors) it just didn't get there. I scored the original a 10 - one of the best movies I've ever seen. You would think this was different writers and directors it was that poor.",6
3761,"Full of inconsistencies, holes and just lack of information.While the abrupt cuts and fast paced scenes broke from the usual slower shots from the first 3 Matrix movies, Resurrections still felt incomplete and doesn't seem to have accomplished anything by the end of the movieWith wannabe memorable quotes and useless ""gen-z"" content, it became harder and harder to take this movie seriously.",5
3762,"I really wish I'd never watched the last 3 matrix movie. The first one was almost perfect.It was kinda nice to revisit the matrix universe, but it just rumbled on in the background while I doomscrolled in our current dystopia nightmare.",4
3763,"That's the best I can describe the newest installment in The Matrix series. If you're looking for something new and innovative with the newest iteration of the Matrix, this isn't the place. While entertaining with the Cyberpunk Gun-Fu, the story is lacking what the character of Neo's One by using the same tropes of being trapped in the Matrix and escaping it in the first film while using plot points from the other films as well. Unfortunately this brought nothing new to the table nor really changed anything we already knew about the previous Matrix films.""Free your mind"" Morpheus once said, why not make something new rather than a soft reboot/non-reboot of your property.",6
3764,"This one is BAD, very BAD. I nearly fell asleep and was considering leaving halfway through. I was able to follow along the horribly put together story line having seen the other 3 Matrix movies, but it still bored me.",1
3765,"I love the Matrix and in another way M2 M3 too for what they where trying to say, Matrix always tries to start a thought process , an OH boy does this movie has something to say if you like what it says is up to each person but i like the way she goes about pointing it out.The only draw back for me was that they more or less shows you all the real world peoples reaction (the ones that don't get the matrix) to the first 3 movies AND this one and it so spot on! But also lays it on a little thick and draws out a little.I liked it a lot, but its not Spider-home 3 or The Shawshank Redemption, but it keeps the spirit of the Matrix maybe even more then 2 and 3 did.",8
3766,"The first movie of the trilogy was earthshaking and groundbreaking. This movie feels like Zack Snyder writing, producing, and directing Meet the Spartans right after making 300. Maybe Lana consulted Weird Al for the story and he decided to play a joke and she didn't notice. Insane.In this movie, the callbacks are unnecessarily long and detailed; the jokes fall flat, and the story feels like it's making fun of the original trilogy instead of honoring it.Not sure why this was made at all. Probably just to pay some bills, although the poor box office might have just created some more bills to pay!I watched the whole movie out of respect, but it wasn't worth it.",5
3767,"Not as good as it could have been but better than expected. It took to long to get ""there"" and tried to squeeze a bit too much in BUT in the end, a good popcorn movie...entertaining but not earth shattering. People expect it to be the second coming - what's wrong with just an entertaining movie.",7
3768,"Even someone who forgot everything or haven't watched yet can enjoy this movie. I love how they explain everything hrough the movie so they answer our questions and even the ones we wouldn't imagined you had the answers for, real sci-fi. 😁I enjoyed it though I sad I wouldn't watch it because I forgot wbat it is about since I haven't watched if since I was little.Hope there is a sequence like a pre-quel about the real world planned.",10
3769,"The original trilogy still, after 20 years, shines with its style and story. The new Matrix has blended into a mass of faceless blockbusters, just hardly gotten out to the screens.It parasites on the fans' nostalgia, attempting to distract from obviuosly illogical and, in parts, frankly silly script.Smith? Alive again? Yes! How? They don't explain. Why does he have a different look? (Because they couldn't get Hugo Weaving) Sorry, they don't explain either. What does he add to the story? Nothing. And yes, he's against Neo again. But not really. Oh, in this scene he's against. And in this scene he's for. And again, against. And again, for. Brilliant!Neo. He looks as weak and tired, as viewers after watching this movie.Trinity is a new Neo? Seriously?? Oh.. wait.. why not?The Analyst. Can stop time, so Neo with his super-powers can do nothing. While Smith bits him easily. Having been bitten by Neo. What a logic!And this is my favorite! An agent, secretly looking for Neo, because he believes in him and wants to be with humans! And then he transforms into Morpheus! Ohhh I wish I had the same mushrooms!Don't worry, I spared a lot from the list for you to check on your own.""Absurd! Ridiculos! Irrational!""The most important here is not to think. Cause once you start, you'll never stop noticing the absurdity of this super-advertised story.But I'll tell you, what's good in this movie. The trailers! They give us a feel of a serious movie with lots of dynamics and hints of a good plot. They show the story it could have become. So - 1 star for the trailers and 1 star for nostalgia.",2
3770,"Thank you to the filmmakers for destroying our nostalgia. I have a question, what is the benefit of this film? A disgusting reproduction of the original versions of the movie, I think the positive thing is that they were able to grow strawberries as an alternative to rust oil.",5
3771,"This film isn't new, it's the old Matrix with modern actors, Smith's actor is terrible, the effect's are good but the dialogues are really boring, they would tell an intelligent think with intelligent words and this is ridiculous. 1° Matrix+modern effects+terrible Smith=Matrix 4.",4
3772,"This movie is just another below average movie Ive seen. Few hours after the movie i think i forgot names of mostly everyone, even the plot is something i have problem remembering.To me the beginning of the movie is interesting. More mind bending psychology sf thriller that if worked out without fancy actions could have been another style of Matrix but very deep.What I've seen sounds like a cheap Netflix show that just needed to have few checkboxes checked. Character development does not exist, purpose of the story, hard to justify. Acting quality... you'll see it. I even think mr. Neo had problems going with the flow on this one.Reboot on this matrix world concept could've been great for many stories, but sadly this felt more like lets earn some quick bucks.",4
3773,"I am one of those people who saw the matrix when It first came out, and I did enjoy the second and third and was very much able to enjoyed and comprehend your vision. I was not very happy to hear about resurrection, but felt obligated to watch it nonetheless. To my surprise I very much enjoyed myself somewhere in the middle. Since 1999 people evolved but so did the matrix and this is expressed well I felt. It didn't bother me that you didn't have the Hong Kong team working on the martial arts, or that the effect were a bit half assed at some points, because what you were expressing was resonating with me. But in the end it was all lost! Sense8 could've been a masterpiece if it wasn't for your personal agenda that corrupted the project, and here in the end I see it again. You're trying to make a gender statement. The movie in the middle was great because it reminds people ""although you know about the matrix does it mean you're free from it"". But in the last part this all disappeared, when instead of telling a story you allowed your personal agenda to corrupt the movie. Which shows me, that The matrix still has a grip on you. You're close to the truth, yet so far (""depends from what distance you're looking at it""). Good luck to you in future projects, I really hope that you will not let your personal issues interfere with your storytelling again.",5
3774,"I think comparison with the original are almost inevitable as that is where this new movie goes so far away and forgets its roots which ironically it glorifies in the first 30 minutes. The original Matrix was a visual revolution, no doubt. Resurrections provides nothing even close to extraordinary. Quite the opposite. It even falls behind some of the recent movies in the same category. For example, the analyst speed power feels extremely cheap. The world of the original was almost a timeless stylized alternative reality while this one feels like just another movie set in 2022. The crew of the Nebuchadnezzar all mattered and had a role to play With a few exceptions this new ship's crew matters very little. I don't even recall the ship having a name. There was a sense of threat and tension in the old Matrix. Resurrections has none. Nobody dies nor is even remotely threatened. The urgency to find a phone and escape is non-existent here. Agents appear briefly and that's it. The new bots are supposedly more effective but while 1 agent can dispose of the whole crew, it takes a thousand bots to do absolutely no damage. Neo went from being the one into being less than half. In Reloaded the architect is supposedly a busy program and was close to impossible to locate. Here, the analyst is Neo's psychiatrist. To what purpose? There could have been a program for that. There's probably more but that is all I can think of on top of my head.Major annoyances and spoilers: Never understood how did they bring Trinity back from the dead? She died in the real world where none of the matrix's rules works. At least Neo's body was physically preserved save for the eyes but they recovered those as well. No way could the Matrix work as a game. What would happen if the player picks the blue pill? Game over? It's way more plausible if it was a movie, but the new generation associates more easily with video games. Niobe's makeup was just horrendous. She looks fake and nowhere near whatever age she's supposed to be. Nobody else survived since Revolutions to remember Neo? Zombie chase scene and Neo's Jedi powers near the end feel very very cheap and for what is considered the climax of the movie, it is extremely poorly executed. Agent Smith shouldn't be in the new Matrix. He had a clear purpose as an agent in the original before going rogue. There was some huge purpose that happened in between and yet the biggest nemesis to everyone and everything got spared??? Him addressing Neo as ""Tom"" is probably the most annoying thing I found with the whole movie. NPH was too much himself from any other movie and not enough of a matrix character or a villain. I was expecting him to say ""wait for it..."" at some point. New Morpheus was confusing since he was nothing like the original, too. I don't even get how his character was mixed with Smith while being programmed.Minor annoyances: Music wasn't up there with the original soundtrack. Up to this day I listen to Reloaded soundtrack. The music in the original trilogy went so well with the action scenes. In here it felt as if it was just thrown in. It's not terrible but not memorable at all.Good impression: Bugs was probably the best thing in the whole movie. She really stole the show. Her and maybe Trinity were the most memorable characters.Last thoughts - I honestly don't think Lana Wachowski wanted to make this movie. It was almost clear when they mentioned WB and the sequel game inside the movie itself. Obviously, there were good ideas within, but it is almost as if the desire to do it wasn't present. You can't make a film of which 1/5 is just a rerun of the original. Everything felt as if the green light was given for a fan-made direct-for-TV movie with the exception of the huge budget. I don't care how bad Revolutions was, at least it tied up with the other movies and was a good conclusion. After I finished the original back in the days I came out of the theatre not realizing what I just watched, almost wanting to back in again for a rerun. For Resurrections , I feel no desire to do so. Nothing remains unanswered.",6
3775,"I was hoping for the movie to be in the same kind of raw visual and art directed world as the older matrix movies, where are the bondage inspired suits and the raw e.b.m. Music?? Probably a production call, ""this movie needs to be for everyone"" i didn't beleave the actors, it felt almost like a parody, the old agent smith was a badass mofo you realy hated him, the new agent smith.. the instagram model looked like he came straight from ibiza.The look and feel of the film:It looks like a high budget commercial with the same lighting. Color grading was as all the hollywood movies. Visual effect kind of cool!For me the story ends on 3 and when im going to teach my kids what movies they should watch i wont mention this one.",3

3782,"Enjoyed the first 3 Matrix movies and completely enjoyed this 4th one. What a refreshing break from the so-called blockbuster movies where dialogues are kept to a bare minimum. The matrix Resurrection has plot, setting, and tons of novel special effects. Lana Wachowski did an exceptional job making this sequel. I look forward to seeing Matrix 5. Keep them coming!",10
3783,"Unbelievably cringe. Constantly playing scenes from the old movies. My god it's tiresome, boring and painful to watch.Also, there are so many charachters introduced that you just don't care about. And Lawrence Fishburn is not playing morpheous? Ugh.",3
3784,"Average storyline with average action sequences and average acting, especially Reeves' performance. All this for the sake of money squished out of fans' nostalgia. This whole irony and metacritique that happens throughout the first part of the movie and in a post-credit scene do not make it better. As they say themselves - Warner Bros wanted another Matrix no matter if anyone had an idea to make a sequel or not, so they gave us average sci-fi movie and that's horrible thing to make for the Matrix series.",2
3785,I was excited for this one because I really enjoyed the first two. My hopes were crushed for the same reason a lot of movies are sucking now days. I'm not sexist I enjoy a hot woman kicking ass as much as the next but when it's so inorganic it's ruins it. What they did at the end with trinity was just stupid to me. The action sucked as well. He never was his old Neo self. The director ranked this sequel and it made me lose interest for any future matrix movies that may come out.,3
3786,"The story works, however the music seems to have been revamped into some sad 2020 replica and the constant nostalgic flashbacks could have been replaced with an intro recap..",6
3787,"I usually don't write reviews, but thought this was necessary to defend the low rating. I was going to give a 8 or 9 out of 10, but then thought I will add a star or two for those that wrote shallow reviews. I was worried at first, thinking what another sequel could offer. After watching, I am very satisfied and think the writers, cast and story deserve way more credit than it receives. No one can be told what to expect in this sequel, you'll have to see it for yourself.",10
3788,"I think the negative rates come from those, who like the sheep in the movie, are stuck in a cycle and crave comfort in conformity. They want it just like the originals with nothing original in it. But how do you follow up one of the greatest trilogies of all time. It's been soo many years. I think the concept and execution were great and the explanation on how the movies tie together on point. The nods to the originals were appreciated.In short this movie opens the door to a world that has otherwise been sealed shut for years. I hope more comes from the Matrix and the ""sheeple"" (Neil Patrick Harris nod) stay quiet.",8
3789,"This was so disappointing. I was very excited to see this bc I really loved the trilogy. Well... I wish I hadn't now. I didn't like the direction they took with the story at all, and the effects were barely straight-to-dvd worthy. I could literally write several pages listing all the cheesy head nods they included to the original, but I'm going to end this here. Should have been named, Matrix 4, Repulsed. If you haven't seen it, don't. It's bad enough to taint the whole franchise.",1
3790,"I had very high expectations for new Matrix movie, but when I saw it it felt like not a sequel but like separate movie apart from all trilogy. So sad that I will watch first Matrix to get my mood back :)",1
3791,"Was so excited to see this movie finally, when I bought it digitally. No way was I going to a covid SuperSpreader event in a theater!Didn't read any hype, watched two trailers, was very pleased with this movie. Glad I bought it. Will likely buy the DVD for features.",10
3792,Wow so glad this was free on HBO otherwise I would be really upset. Definitely not worth a ticket price. Even my kids thought it was terrible. I will keep my trilogy and forget this garbage was ever made.,2
3793,I do not doubt that the original Matrix trilogy is one of the best movies ever made.The Matrix Resurrections looks like a tasteless fan-made remake of the original Matrix with documentary and parody elements.,1
3794,"The movie was what it needed to be, a high budget South Park episode. And I honestly loved it. The original trilogy had closure, and that's what I consider canon. This movie was apparently Warner forcing a fourth movie and the writing team mocked the whole situation and the fan base, which I think was great. Not every piece of art must be serious and meaningful, I laughed a lot and had a great time. It was better than any Marvel DC movie, better jokes, they subverted the iconic moments in the originals and the movie does not take it self too serious. It was truthful to the writers, not the public, and I think this matters a lot in a world where the spectators are taking everything so seriously.",10
3795,Yes. You heard it right. It's not what you were expecting. They killed this movie's legacy by making this below average crap. Nothing looks exciting and it looks like script is forced to make something out of this movie. Overall complete disaster .,3
3796,"If you see this movie, prepare for The Matrix to be forever ruined for you.The pinnacle of the film is the 10 minute comedy scene in the first 30 minutes, where the movie is mockingitself and Warner Brothers openly.",1
3797,"Lana Wachowski has missed everything that made the first film interesting, this film felt more like a sequel to Jupiter Ascending. She figured out how to work with harnesses out between buildings and that's her new thing.The action scenes sucked, from the series that had the lobby shootout, the highway chase and even in revolutions with the dumb mech suit thing at least that was an action set that seemed thought out. None of the settings in Resurrections felt lived in or real. They completely flopped on execution here.Everything that was clever about Neil patrick Harris's character was ruined by the 4th wall breaks and directly calling it bullet time.. That was something the audience called it, you can't address the audience in a film like this. Also how did Smith interrupt his powers of bullet time with a punch then somehow keep him incapacitated for the rest of the scene even though they were split up. Wouldn't he just go back to freezing time and subduing Neo and Trinity?The amount of cuts to the Matrix one made it feel like what Disney is doing with Star Wars nostalgia has been tasteful. That was forcing a comparison by contrast.The editing, CG, framing for action shots, all were horrible throughout this film. This was a shock coming from a Wachowski you'd think the person who revolutionized slow motion action shots would have been able to produce one memorable moment in this film but no. The action scenes look like Liam Neeson in Taken 3, Keanu Reeves does not have the speed after back surgery and his age. This should have been factored into the screenplay.The action scenes without Keanu also, some of them people were being shot at point blank and just spinning around the room on a wire harness. It looked silly.I think all this fourth film has proven is that Lana Wachowski isn't a good filmmaker and there's a strong chance The Matrix was like The Hangover and the Wachowskis never really wrote the whole thing. It was probably a director for hire to finish it or make it interesting. The hangover was a Jamie Kennedy script he sold with rights to star, Todd Phillips took it over dissolved that contract and filmed it with another cast. Thats why every film after is so different, most of the production was helmed by another creative team. I think it's very likely this is the case with the Matrix.",4
3798,"Definitely a nice different approach to the story.Hopefully we can get more.The acting was on point with the action.On a low rating it's a seven.On a high rating it could be considered a 10.I gave it a nine because I loved it and I want more.Don't hold yourself to the past too much, this movie was a great continuation to the story.",9
3799,"Just don't compare it to the original. I'm the first half of the movie when Keanu Reeves acidity has to convey emotion, his woeful acting goes beyond something you can ignore. Once he's back to being the one, it's not so bad.Don't want to spoil but the whole thing seems a little unnecessary, and yes they play on that a bit. It's reasonably well made pushing most of the buttons that made fans love the originals, if not quite as stylish or well put together.A 3 star movie, nothing mind blowing.",6
3800,"Remember the Matrix from 1999? Remember its moments? Its iconic dialogues, Hugo Weaving as agent Smith, Morpheus , Trinity..... of course you do!! In fact this film banks on it and forcefully reminds you of all the iconic moments, scenes, dialogues from the first Matrix movie by literally having footage from the 1999 flick.It starts out pretty interesting with its meta self aware plot, where we learn what Neo has been upto and the where Trinity has been. Its self awareness is perhaps a bit too on the nose but intriguing nonetheless. Its probably the best part of the film because it abandons all that to settle back into the older Matrix questions and ideas.There are lot of great ideas particularly in the first 30 minutes, less so in the rest of the film, the execution however is questionable. One of the greatest shocks that this film delivers is its disappointing action!Its ironic that the franchise known for staging some of the most revolutionary action set pieces of all time has now delivered some of the most forgettable ones in modern cinema. The film looks and feels like any other modern generic sci-fi show and is devoid of any artistic personality that made its predecessors stand out.The tone switches from comedic self-aware to intense and super serious, which leads to some really bad techno babble which is pretty hard to understand or care about. It at times feels like a parody of the Matrix but then there are some really intense moments that force you to take it seriously and those two things don't mesh with each other well.There are still cool things and sci-fi concepts being displayed but in meagre numbers, the editing is sloppy and pacing haphazard. They are quick to remind us of the original Matrix by playing the original footage over and over in many of the scenes to literally feed us nostalgia. The plot gets increasingly convoluted and quite needlessly dumb if you stop to think about it.Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss are on point but the film just doesn't stick with them for most parts, the other new characters are forgettable and aren't that interesting to begin with. We get Niobe back and a revisit to Zion which looks interesting but are only there briefly so it isn't much valuable.The third act should be simple to understand but certain changes and character growths are so seemingly drastic that you are left with more questions than answers. Ultimately this sequel pretty much kills any desires of any more sequels or spin-offs that we might have expected or wanted , in fact there seems to be a general intent from Lana Wachowski to bash on this whole idea of franchises which she has subtly conveyed through the films first 30 minutes or so and also with an end credit scene.Is this an Anti-Sequel? Are we supposed to enjoy the trashing of the Matrix franchise by its own Sequel??Is it romance?? Meta Commentary??? All of it ?? Lana Wachowski doesn't stick to one thing but adds all of it in one film that results in yet another messy Matrix sequel. For many fans this could be the worst one.......and will probably leave them with no desire to rewatch it anytime soon for this one for whatever reasons feels the most heartless and passionless.Or maybe I am looking at it from the wrong perspective?? Maybe ......maybe not....time will tell but for now The Matrix Resurrections is another messy sequel that fails to capture the hearts or the imagination that the 1999 one did so brilliantly.",3
3801,Worst movie I've ever watched. My bf and I watched this today and almost fell asleep in the cinema. And I got constipation today so I'd rather spend my time in the toilet instead of sitting in the cinema watching this movie.Never watch this again!,1
3802,"This Fourth Version of the Matrix Universe had moments early in the film that was reminiscent of the first film, which was the best of the first three. It started as a minimal film as Neo was brought back from world and reintroduced to another. Unfortunately, it couldn't be that intimate film that was so enjoyable but had to revert back to over extended martial art battles (boring!!!) to a cast of thousands, or maybe hundreds (?) and extreme destruction that made the third film a complete failure. This film went from entertaining to boring back to entertaining to extremely bad. Such promise that ultimately became a disappointment once again. At least the ending was...you decide because I won't spoil it. And, just my opinion, the music selection at the beginning of the end credits was atrocious.",6
3803,"According to my wife, The Matrix Resurrections is a comedy. To explain further it is a self-parody of the trilogy meta-perspectively made by its original creators. This is a movie of a middle-aged man who couldn't get out of childish illusion nor over foolish imagination which he truly believed in and cared for in his youth. Don't take it seriously. Just have fun laughing at the man in the mirror. Wake up!",5
3804,"I get the hate. I really do. I found Resurrections to be a refreshing entry into the series. Maybe it's because I went in with such low expectations, prepared to hate it, that I didn't have the same reaction that so many are having. Maybe a rewatch is in order to really know.Resurrections did a fine job of incorporating its obligatory nostalgia-based fan service while also taking off on its own legs to carry on the story in a satisfying way that sees our two primary heroes reunited. It's not as good as the original but nothing was ever going to be. I would rank it well beyond Reloaded and put it about on par with Revolutions.It has its problems for sure. I wasn't a big fan of the portrayals or Morpheus or Smith (nothing against the actors) and the ending certainly leaves a bit to be desired, but other than a few nitpicks here and there it managed to deliver in ways I didn't quite expect.Was it necessary to make? No, of course it wasn't. But I'm happy to see it exist. Don't expect the same old formula because the times have changed.",7
3805,"They should have kept it with the trilogy of the late 90's early 2000's. As a huge Matrix fan, I am very disappointed. The story is weak. Also the acting of Keanu Reeves is horrible. Not amused.",2
3806,"When I first heard of this movie being produced I was excited, then I saw the trailer and got less excited and when the day came to see the movie I was not excited at all.I dont know if thats the case but it felt very fastly made. I didn't see any thought, scenery, grandeur etc that was in the original Trilogy at all in this one.But honestly, I think the biggest problem can be summed up in one word, ambience. The original trilogy gave such a perfect feeling of reality and matrix. You really felt the difference. But it wasnt just the difference between the two worlds. It was the ambience of the two worlds themselves.Lets take the real world, it honestly felt more like a feel good sci-fi movie with so much smaller sets or at the least, sets were even Io felt tiny and recorded in a tiny studio. With so few important characters. This wasnt the feeling even in the hated revolutions.The size, the feeling, everything is gone. The big crowds, the many important figures in Zion and so on.Then we have the Matrix. I get that making the real world properly sizeable mightve been a budget issue but the matrix felt real.I know its the fact that its made as a refreshed newer version of the old matrix but Neil Patrick was doing a comedy bit. Smith wasnt menacing at all and all in all, the matrix honestly didnt feel simulated at all.And oh my god, the swarm function, such a cheap way to solve the issues.The story was fine, just everything around it felt not accomplished, maybe it was the budget, maybe it was ""following the trend"" and make it less dark/green as in the Original trilogy but it was just ok and didnt give any other feeling that thinking this was a fast project to get some money.",6
3807,"For what it's worth, I didn't mind the core story. It's everything else I didn't like. The choices with Smith, over eccentric Morpheus, and terrible acting by Jada. The camera work in the fight sequences was awful compared to previous matrix movies. Hand held. Shake. Close. Can't follow well. Great action pieces were pointless due to the cinematography.All in all its half. Half. I liked some stuff. Hated others. I think If it was smaller it would have been better. It suffers similar issues Star Wars prequels if that makes sense.Oh and where did the Second helicopter go?????So 4 out of 10. Wait to stream for me.Oh. Carrie Anne Moss did great.",4
3808,"As a Matrix fan I wanted this to me much better. There are issues with most areas of this film. From the poor plot, to the casting, the lack of cinematic effect/presence, the shocking music/score and through to the off putting throwback references. The film lacks presence throughout and consequently suffers with engagement to the audience, at least in my opinion. It has that feel of a ""change in management/direction"" so I was surprised to find a Wachowski behind the wheel. I guess they can't all be greats. On a positive - I enjoyed Niel Harris as the Analyist, this was one of the few fitting new characters. I await the next one and hope for something more fitting to the skills that the Wachowski's have shown before. Keep the faith :-)",4
3809,"I almost never add a review, but this one was such a disappointment that I'm going to the trouble of doing so. The plot was very confused until well into the movie. Then it finally settles into an old, recognizable pattern. But once there there's absolutely nothing new or imaginative happening. It's was mostly so-so from there till the end of the movie. But the device of trotting out ""old"" characters played by new actors (in at least one case wearing makeup intended to make her look old) is overused. The acting skills of the General in particular are not only unsuited to creating the impression of being an old person, she's an insult to old people, with her rigid posture and faked faltering-voice. Come on guys, she's supposed to be old, not dying. The actor playing Morpheus really tries to measure up to his predecessor, but those are big shoes to fill and his abilities aren't on par with his predecessor's. With most of these characters played by new actors it would have been better to abandon the old character in favor of developing new ones. Instead, they rely on new actors who mention that they're really the old characters and therefore they skip any character development. The trouble is, if you've seen the old movies then you're generally unconvinced by most of these portrayals, and if you're new to The Matrix then they fail to capitalize on these actors' skills to show you who these characters really are. Its wholly uninteresting. It's just a poor job. As usual the special effects are crazy good. But that's about it. Finally, there's a hint at the end that there may be yet another movie to come in The Matrix franchise. If there is then I doubt that I'll watch it. I really looked forward to this movie, having seen all previous versions and loved them. With this one however, I not only wish I hadn't spent the money, I wish I hadn't seen the movie.",3
3810,"After 20 minutes it is painful -- the writers must have though we are all dumb because we believe lockdown new normal is good -- terrible, lack of storyline.",1
3811,"Ever since I first heard about this movie I've had a weird feeling. A feeling...I guess you could say is a little bit foreboding and uncomfortable. Like, maybe this movie should not exist. Maybe this movie will be one of the worst things to ever come out... like maybe this new Matrix movie would kind of exhume the coffin of a franchise that is dead and buried. Like maybe this new Matrix movie would violate the corpse inside of that exhumed coffin.Not that The Matrix Franchise is an inviolable corpse, it has its faults (i.e. The last two movies), but the most respectable thing about the third film is that it has a definitive conclusion. Say what you will about Revolutions, that movie ends. Hard. Like a book slamming closed. It makes it pretty clear that the series is finished.So why is there a new Matrix movie?That exact question gets asked, a lot, in The Matrix Resurrections.But I am going to stop there. I don't want to say too much about the plot.But I will say that The Matrix Resurrections is actually a good movie.Like past installments, it's not without fault, but what franchise is faultless (besides LotR)? I like the way Lana Wachowski turned everything on its head and tried something bold and brave and strange and new. That's exactly what made the original Matrix so appealing and enduring, it was so unlike everything else being made at the time. The irony is that after it was released, everything attempted to be just like it. Endlessly imitated, endlessly parodied, never bested. It set a new standard in sci-fi, in the narrative of action films, and film in general.It would be nearly impossible for Resurrections to match the original, but Lana doesn't do that; and that's why Resurrections works. The movie would be a total embarrassment if Lana tried to outdo the brilliant film she and her sister Lilly created 23 years ago. Lana finds brilliant ways to acknowledge the towering success of the original movies but makes Resurrections its own beast with a very unique identity, yet it still fits in the family.It's a good movie, but as mentioned above there are faults.It is too long, it clocks in at 2 and half hours, it feels very front heavy. Setting everything up takes way too much time and isn't incredibly helpful now that I've seen the whole thing.Restraint (not those kinds of restraints, you Bound freaks!) has never been Wachowski's strong point and this movie needed more restraint in it's exposition and dialogue. It gets laughable (not the good kind) at a few points, and even cringe inducing at others.Keanu Reeves feels right at home reprising his role, but he is completely outshined by Carrie-Anne Moss. She truly delivers a phenomenal performance. That cringey dialogue I was talking about? She makes it sound good and that is very difficult and is a testament to just how great she is.Visually the movie looks fantastic. The CGI is good. I just saw Spiderman: No Way Home and thought the CGI looked so cartoony; it's crazy that Resurrections is far more cartoony in it's premise but visually looked so much more impressive and realistic.This is a good movie.Why do I have to keep saying that? Like I am trying to convince myself...Despite my praise I still have reservations (possible Matrix 5 title?) about this movie. An unresolved sinking feeling in my gut. A mild discomfort.I think it's because I inherently feel wrong about this film's existence. I truly don't believe it needed to be made. It bothers me that Lana and Lilly can't get the money they deserve to tread new ground. Warner Bros. Just wants to keep the money rolling in, so why not resurrect the franchise?But I can't hold that against this movie...can I?",6

3817,"First of all, people who wanted to have the same emotions and shock when they first saw The Matrix should just move on. Nothing can even come close. However, if you keep an open mind, the movie has a bit of everything. Some scenes to relive the first memories and emotions from the original movie, some fresh new ideas that I didn't anticipate, but overall the story holds together with a few unexpected twists that keep you into your seat. I recommend it to anyone, it is fresh and original yet still has bits from the original story, and lives up to the original movie. If I were to complain about something that would be the cast choice : there is no reason why Hugo and Lawrence are missing. Changing the original cast is always a big faux-pas in my opinion - just makes you wondering : what if?...So don't judge the movie by its lower rating : definitely worth watching and not to miss!",8

Anything you've seen in the previews that left you scratching your head, those things are answered, and answered well!Thomas Anderson is a middle-aged game designer, who's trilogy called ""The Matrix"" has made him a small time celebrity, but he has problems distinguishing between what's real and what isn't. But his psychiatrist is helping him get through it. Or are those flashes actually memories...Get ready for a wild ride as he learns who he really is, and who he's up against this time!This movie pays proper homage to the original trilogy, as well as makes it fresh and new at the same time! Highly recommend seeing it more than once!And there was one scene I'm not a huge fan of because I thought it could have been done better, but it still fit.........(Spoiler!!!) When they jumped off the building holding hands and stop in mid-air, I think it could have been done better. It's the only thing I wasn't a fan of.

3822,"I was hoping to watch a good movie and was seriously disappointed. Acting was bad, they killed one of main actors and that is Lawrence Fishburn in favor of some other. On top of that you got John Wick playing Neo. The hell?!? I mean, the movie seems to be forced instead of being created with passion. Obviously Keanu was not in the mood to make it better and he should at least change appearance instead of that beard and that ""greasy hobo hair look"".In short I was very disappointed.",5
3823,"I still don't understand what happened to the new sequel of my favourite movie. Everything was in place to make a wonderful sequel, yet it's as if the makers deliberately didn't want it to be good.I understood that they were making fun of today's filmmaking..but I'm a fan, that's why I watched it, it wasn't even funny.The story specifically would have been good if it was half the movie max, meanwhile when it finally had iconic moments, nothing helped it make an impact.E.g. Trinity finally knows who she is and recognizes Neo...so what? 5 second scene and we're rushing on into some pointless shootout. That's it?This kind of revival of the character of Morpheus is beyond my understanding, why, why? He was there, but not there?THE Builders successor was simply annoying.Smith was also featureless, uninteresting in all his appearances. The new characters are just flat, nothing makes them interesting, they didn't even try to be. The majority of the conversations are uninteresting, simply passable.For me, it lacked the catharsis I always got in the prequel films.I still don't understand what happened to the new sequel of my favourite movie. Everything was in place to make a wonderful sequel, yet it's as if the makers deliberately didn't want it to be good.All is given for a sequel, but please make it better!",6
3824,"The characters, story and development of both are mind bending and perfect. The setup and pay off work at a master level. Watch it for yourself. Neil Patrick Harris and Jonathon Goff alone add layers of interest on their own. Don't listen to the negatives. This movie is wonderful.This site isn't updated well enough in its own Matrix to know there are no spoilers above.Do yourself a favor and rewatch all 3 of the first ones.It will benefit you and has 100 items through the movie that matter.",10
3825,"And a way to tack on a happy ending for Neo and Trinity. Makes fun of itself about being a cash grab and adds little to the original story. CGI was good but the action scenes appeared stiff and unnatural. A lot longer than it needed to be, and it still appeared disjointed.",6
3826,"As for coming up with a story they even admit it in the first 45 mins of the movie when brainstorming for the 4th game how difficult it is to come up with something as mind blowing as the original matrix story.For everyone thinking ""this isn't the matrix from 1999"", yea that's literally the point and what the analysis says. This matrix is based on ""feelings"" (which makes us produce more energy) not on facts and theories as the original 1999 matrix.Do I think a part 5 will come out, yes. Do I think they teased just enough open ended questions for the lore to be expanded on, you bet.One thing I think they should have explained more on ""bots"", who populate this matrix with humans. I took it as individuals the humans meet who are jerks, Karen etc etc to invoke strong emotional reaction from the humans to produce more.I find this film of fitting 2021 given the political and disinformational setting we are are in.",8
3827,"These ppl rated the flash series 7.8, the series that's an insult to human inetellect! One thing i'm pretty sure about: ppl are dumber and i'm serious. This Matrix opus called them the Sheeple and it's so true! Great sequel with great story ! Thank you Lana!",10
3828,"Great flick! It wasn't the greatest in the series but LW didn't hold her punches back on why she made this movie. NPH, Geoff and Henwick were all fantastic additions. Yahya was great as well although his part felt a bit on the short end. In the end I enjoyed everything I saw on the screen and the crowd I was with had a blast! Definitely recommend it in IMAX!",8
3829,"If this movie wasn't related to the Matrix saga, it would be an ""ok"" movie, at best. But as a sequel for such an iconic franchise, this movie is weak, and it hardly held my attention. I watched the previous three before going into this one, because it had been a while, and I wanted everything that came before to be fresh. The good thing is that I could get those minor references that I would never have gotten otherwise, but it was also bad because of the contrast between them. It didn't... feel like a Matrix movie, I guess? It was a bold move to stray so much from the feel of the originals, but if you wanna go as meta as this, you'd be better off playing it safe and try to get the most out of the feeling of nostalgia from the audience. I felt everything was rushed, even though the movie has a duration of over 2 hours. There are so many new concepts and so much things happened between Matrix Revolutions and Resurrections, that it was just a lot to grasp and didn't feel natural.",4
3830,It has lots of ideas and even art put in a package that the producers hoped a new generation would like. Original film: 486's with large screens and the internet was being slowly picked up by the media. Current film: Everyone has social media so obviously the original film had the wrong plot given that everyone now has better equipment. It's like a priest trying desperately to update Adam and Eve after seeing how DNA works. Fails but it didn't have to. The people who made the first one were clever. This one was made by people who thought they were smart.,6
3831,"When the Matrix came out, it instantly became one of my favorite movies ever. It still is. Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions made me feel like I was betrayed. So what is Matrix 4?It feels like an apology to a specific part of the fans of the first movie. Ab apology for Reloaded and Revolutions"". With an artistic fourth wall bounce, the movie makes it crystal clear what this is all about and what the first Matrix was all about.",7
3832,"Revisiting the matrix was always going to be a risk 20 years later. The costumes and hairstyles of 1999 which identified the ""unplugged"" as the coolest, calmest, and most collected of stylish badasses have aged like... well, a millennial that still wears his matrix-inspired trenchcoat to the club on Saturday night.They touched on some inception-esque philosophy in the first act which was almost interesting, but ultimately a confusing exposition dump. Something the Wachowskis and Nolan are both known for.There was plenty of self awareness and very on-the-nose writing in the first act which prompted a few wry chuckles, but meta humor is not a substitute for a quality story.The story oozes contrivance for the sake of having a story - one is reminded of another IP with ""resurrection"" in the title here - and while this could be forgiven if we were at least treated to some new and ambitious action scenes, this is sadly not the case.The first movie revolutionised the action genre. The second movie had its work cut out for it but made a fair attempt at upping the ante with the mansion battle and infamous highway chase, but this movie feels like a massive step backwards in the realm of action choreography.Sluggish, uninspiring melees which frequently feel like they were filmed in a mosh pit. Confusing camera cuts and messy angles, slow-mo and bullet time used to death alongside the deep bass audio cue which we have seen and heard everywhere for the past two decades.The least I hoped for going into this was an attempt to introduce some new and exciting action scene ideas, but there was nary a lifted brow in the house throughout the film. Neo employed a new and underwhelming ability, and then proceeded to spam it for 30 minutes straight reducing the phenomenal cosmic power of being The One to nothing more than mashing the X button repeatedly.There was a scene in the final act that almost prompted a ""whoa"" from me, until I remembered an almost verbatim scene in 2008s The Happening.The wardrobes and hairstyles were all hillariously distracting, with Agent Smith being the only exception in his new Harvey Spectre inspired skin.Very impressed that Keanau appears to have shaved for the role. He looked like John Wick for 90% of the film, though.It could be argued that the film is well aware of all of my criticisms and even addresses these challenges explicitly quite early on, but the fact still stands that I walked out of the theatre underwhelmed.All around a bit of a wasted opportunity here. I'm convinced the only way to get a win out of the IP now, is to bring on a passionate action choreographer, slap an R16 rating on it and focus on hyper-violent, ultra-creative action scenes. Beats letting all of the shoe-horned scenes with swords and other feudal knick-nacks go to waste.",5
3833,"This movie should not have made it to production. The 1st one was Great, second dipped, 3rd was meh... But THIS ruined it.Casting:gimme Laurence Fishburne instead I don't care if he old as a prune old and wrinkly and gray - he's still better and would fit the part easilyMr. Smith?! What the heck happened?! Hugo Weaving IS Smith! Instead you casted... never mind I still want this review to be posted without spoilersUse CGI or somethingThe Plot was all over the place.The fight scene between Neo and Smith, I dunno if Smith wants to destroy Neo or sleep with him, it looked more like some lovers quarrel.Haircuts:What on earth is that?!Oohh tryin to be edgy?Is it too political? You be the judge.",1
3834,"I could see the writers had an overall ok idea for this movie but the acting and production was sloppy. Done to make a quick buck. The fighting and action scenes were not good at all. No 360 degree effect, not at least one. Just a few running on walls lol... too much slow motion dragging out scenes 😴Morphes was terrible acting, Agent Smith was terrible acting aswell. I found many of the actors and actress terrible! Like if they were low budget actors for a B movie.Could've been alot more promising but was just too sloppyfor me 😂",5
3835,"I really wanted this to be a good film as I am a fan of the originals. There is an odd mix of nostalgia and forgetting of the lore as half of the movie are clips from the original and the ending.....SPOILER... the ending has the biggest part of the original films changed as Neo is no longer ""the one"" and Trinity becomes a carbon copy of him. They could have made this interesting and created a new path for Trinity where she became Neos equal in her own way and we could have had a great film just about that, instead we depower Neo to make Trininty seem stronger and throw away the mythos to the original film. This film deserved more than being a copy of the original and the characters deserved better than just becoming clones of each other.",3
3836,"I can see why a lot of ppl didn't like it but for me I enjoyed it for what it is. I was good to see the Matrix universe and some of the casts again. Definitely nostalgia lane. Good to see Keanu again, action was decent, and Bugs was the standout. I thought they could of done better job of casting Morpheus and Agent Smith...they both sucked lol. Other than that the movie was entertaining and nostalgic. 7/10.",7
3837,The funniest part was when they shook hands and a lot of energy was released at once. Similar to kids animation :)John wickJohn wickJohn wickJohn wickJohn wick.,1
3838,"If you love to laugh about really trashy movies, this is a gem for you.Bad acting, horrible dialogues, bad music, horrible camera movement and very cheesy and cheap cgi effects. The directing seems to be done by an amateur child director. And the script is such a bad storytelling.It is fascinating, how bad of a movie you can make!!!So it's a good laugh.If you expect epic cinema, like the first Matrix movie, please don't go. You will leave the cinema dissapointed.",4
3839,"I just watched this movie and was very pleased. It was a great addition to the Matrix. Not only was the story interesting, but it was fully aware of what it was. Every fan will love it.",10
3840,Why. Make this film beyond a cash grab. To be honest this film never held my attention. Rehashing concepts that were previously resolved. As far as I'm concerned pull the plug this matrix and let it die the death it deserves.,5
3841,"Some ideas I thought were cool but not fully fleshed out. There were also ideas I thought were pointless and just underwhelming. Something is lacking with this movie and it's a whole combination of things. I now understand why there were two writers/directors for the original Matrix trilogy.THE GOOD (but most of it wasn't fleshed out enough for me to give this a higher score)The Analyst (until the end). Neil Patrick Harris did a good job with what he was given and I was intrigued with the idea of this sentient program pulling the strings with this new iteration of the Matrix. His process of exploiting human emotions in order to generate more power for the machines makes sense considering the machines were using human beings as batteries in the first Matrix movie.-Neo &amp; Trinity scenes. It was cool seeing Keanu Reeves &amp; Carrie-Anne Moss together on screen again. I thought their scenes together were decent and at times I felt a little nostalgic.The new Zion. ""Io"" I think that's what it was called. It was cool to show the impact Neo's sacrifice on the real world and the neat idea of some Machines helping humans slowly regrow resources like plants, fruits, water, etc.THE MEHThe Merovingian. I was looking forward to seeing this character again especially when I saw he was looking like a bum in the trailers. I was curious to know how a program so powerful in the previous movies (who was in charge of ghosts, vampires, werewolves, a trainman, and had a hot wife) could lose it all. You could've made a whole movie based off that and if I'm being honest, it probably would've been a better movie too. Unfortunately he is only in the movie for a brief moment but Lambert Wilson does okay and made me chuckle with his over the top performance this go around. Sucks this character wasn't given much attention cause I truly wanted to know the full backstory of his downfall.The New Morpheus. I didn't like how he was introduced in the beginning as an agent and I wasn't completely sold on Yahya Abdul-Mateen replacing Laurence Fishburne. That is until the character revealed he was created by Neo as an algorithmic reflection of Morpheus &amp; Agent Smith. In addition to being a new kind of machine in the real world, I was hooked on the idea however I would've preferred this character to be called something else other than ""Morpheus"". Whenever I think of Morpheus, I think of Laurence Fishburne not Yahya. Also his character takes a bit of a back seat as the story progresses which kind of makes some of his initial scenes pointless.The Operator use. Cool to see some shots of the Operator looking like he's there with Bugs but it got old fast and it came off as lazy at times. Looked like they didn't want to cut back and forth from the real world &amp; the Matrix like they used to in the original trilogy.Bugs. Interesting supporting character who could've had more focus and depth much like the New Morpheus. I wasn't sold on the idea that she was a Captain in the real world because she didn't act like one as shown in the previous Matrix movies. She acted more like a second in command (like Trinity) or basically a loner who did their own thing and doesn't take orders well from people. She also takes a backseat as the story progresses. For someone who had been inspired by Neo to wake up from the Matrix, you would think the filmmakers would give time to develop Bugs &amp; Neo's relationship in a similar fashion to Neo &amp; Morpheus's relationship from the first Matrix movie. Not to mention the missed opportunity to develop Bugs relationship with the New Morpheus. You started the movie with Bugs &amp; the New Morpheus so why not make the whole thing about them learning, growing, and getting to know each other throughout this journey to bring back Neo &amp; Trinity.The Machine/Program Purge. Love the idea of a Matrix/Machine World Civil War. This also could've been it's own movie if fleshed out properly but it's glossed over and just used as brief exposition to catch Neo up on what he missed out on.THE OUTRIGHT BADThe New Agent Smith. I knew this was a bad idea when it was revealed in the trailers and after seeing the movie... Yeah it's definitely a bad idea to use a new Agent Smith. Reasons being is because it makes the Machines look extremely foolish to reinsert a virus program that nearly destroyed the Matrix in the past. My concerns came true when Smith turned on The Analyst at the cafe during the final fight scene. This made the Analyst look bad. Not to mention reinserting Smith as Neo's business partner where they work closely together knowing full well Smith has a grudge against Neo for stopping him in the past. Also why didn't Smith kill Neo when they were business partners and Neo was easily vulnerable with no memory? It completely takes away from Neo stopping Smith from the last movies. Much like the New Morpheus, this character should've been a new character with a new name because whenever I hear the name Agent Smith, I think of Hugo Weaving not Jonathan Groff.Neo can't fly but Trinity can. The movie has a recurring reference to Neo flying but it's turned into a gag when ultimately Neo can't fly anymore. However when Trinity flies for the first time in her life, she's got it down packed while Neo struggles. Doesn't make sense especially when Neo gets new force-like telekinetic powers in this movie so why not let Neo fly? It was an ability he easily had control of in the previous Matrix movies.Lore Retcons. Since this is a new Matrix. Why isn't there a new One? Technically Neo &amp; Trinity are from the last installment of the Matrix and they've even mentioned that they're old. I thought there was always going to be a new One for every new Matrix? There's no mention of programs having a purpose and returning to the source much like the previous movies.Action Scenes. The previous Matrix movies had lovely action scenes that had good kung fu choreography and memorable gun shootouts. Resurrections does not. If like the Jason Bourne rapid-edit cut fight scenes then you'll like this. I did not. Only memorable moment was the blue-pills falling from the buildings to their deaths while trying to stop Neo &amp; Trinity from escaping.Overuse of original trilogy clips in-between scenes. This was SO ANNOYING to see this happen almost every time they make a reference to the previous Matrix movies. It took me out of the moment plenty of times and it became distracting. It reminded me of how better the previous movies were in comparison to this one. I get the filmmakers were trying to be experimental but this backfired big time.The Return of Sati. The character was just there and forgettable. Don't know how to further explain it but Sati was only there to provide exposition and nothing else. No real impact and emotion came from her appearance. Could've been a random new program and it wouldn't have made any difference.The Opening. Spent a little too much time on Neo acting ""crazy"" plus being inter cut with the introduction Bugs and the New Morpheus made it feel clustered. Any casual viewer is going to be confused and likely bored by what transpires in the opening bits of this movie. The movie being Meta was alright but it got old quick by the time the scene of the game developers pitching ideas for a ""Matrix 4 video game"" came around.The Ending. Things got really lazy from when Smith turned on The Analyst all the way to Trinity kicking around The Analyst at the end. This really made a compelling villain look incompetent. In the end, I wasn't left intrigued to know what was going to happen next and the Rage Against The Machine Cover song didn't make things better. If you're gonna use the song, use the original band who did it please.",5
3842,"What a dumpster fire. Regurgitated one liners and unoriginal ""zombies"". The entire movie was far to slow to get going, and had a rushed plot toward the middle of the movie. There was little to no story telling.",2
3843,"The Matrix concept has so much potential for storylines of warfare and peace between reality and fiction. Why keep going back to the Neo &amp; Trinty love affair. I nickname this Matrix Regurgitation because thats the only way to get them two back on the screen. C'Mon, get real and make a Matrix movie thats fresh to resurrect the franchise not torture kids into barfing up their popcorn.",6
3844,"To quickly sum up, It didnt need to be made, brings nothing new to the franchise and is basically 2 hours of looking back and saying look how good the first movie was... Waste of time!Do yourself a favour watch Dune instead.",3
3845,"Sequels please! I think the fight scenes looked better than the originals and better cgi. The wire work looks really bad in the original and looks tuned down in this , which I'm okay with.",10
3846,"I was (like many of us) waiting for another episode of this legendary movie, but I was highly disapponted. The movie is full of cringe dialects and ""humor"". This wasn't worth the name of this movie at all. Shame!",4
3847,"I read everywhere, ""Matrix 1 is unsurpassable however 2 and 3...""B*tch, please...Matrix 2 brings up all about human freedom, the war between ""man"" and machine, and the third movie being a direct sequel. (the last scene of 2 is the first scene of 3) expands on that with the problem of choice and all that. Honestly and with all respect to those involved, this just doesn't add anything. Makes the machines look stupid.To me at least.Deus Machina gave Neo the source code?!?",2
3848,"Too many do not have patience for the build up of a story, They want action now (microwave world - The Matrix)... I thought it was great, loved the messages &amp; the acting. It started out slow, which requires patience &amp; understanding. Too People today just want action &amp; violence.",8
3849,"First of all, they should have left the series finished. I don't know what I watched but it wasn't Morpheus, Neo or even Trinity... Smith makes no real sense, the new Architect/Oracle/Analyst has no real influence aside from explaining why it took sixty years to restart the Matrix properly... And the ending refers back to The Matrix series and points out what we always knew about the pair, ironically highlighted by the Analyst in his explanation, he just underplays it.One one hand, the movie made some sense, on the other hand it was rubbish and ruined the whole series.",7
3850,"This movie is definitely weird, slow, hard to follow, and again, weird. Like, really weird.However, once you understand the whole point of the film, it grows on you.The first hour its meant to show how your world would be, if the Matrix was actually real. Which is why is so fast paced, wicked, so meta and self aware of its own existence. Miss Lana is basically showing you how Matrix would be in real life.Once Neo wakes up, the movie awakens itself from the Matrix Limbo, which is when it finally breaths, shows its true nature and colors, and it's a true continuation of what made Matrix 2 and 3 so damn fun.During the 2nd act and 3rd act, you can see how much effort it was put to the writing of the film; The IO story, the Machines Civil War story, the destruction of Zion, who the Analyst is, why the Matrix is so change, how Trinity survived.The movie takes it's time to explain everything, which in the end it feels good.The first time you see this, is nothing as you would expect from a Matrix sequel; after the 2nd viewing, the film definitely grows in you, like I said before.For me, it's a solid 8/10. It's not perfect, has flaws regarding how the story, pacing and editing functions, but everything else is quite notch.Fun movie.",8
3851,Lightning does not strike twice. This addition had its moments and it's own new additions but it isn't something I'd watch again. That's saying something coming from someone who absolutely loves sci-fi/action/adventure. I eat stuff like this up. This movie left me cold.,4
3852,"After taking a few days to let everything simmer down, I realized upon further reflection that I could really only justify giving this movie a 5/10. One of the main problems is that the ""meta"" awareness is used to a nauseating degree. While some self-awareness often works in movies in certain contexts, the problem is that it undermines the ability to have a plot. The first half of the movie is essentially a reworking of the first movie under different circumstances. When it does this, the problem is that the plot does not become one of mystery, but of psychological conditioning. It is like when you are seeing your favorite band live and the vocalist implores the crowd to sing the chorus of their favorite song. If one sees somebody dressed as a lumberjack in front of a tree with an axe, your mind automatically assumes that the lumberjack is going to be cutting down the tree next. You will probably be right. The problem is that you see one thing in this movie and then you are automatically able to predict what will happen next with too much accuracy. A part of the genius of the trilogy preceding it was the mystery that surrounds everything. When you watch the first movie, you had no idea what it meant to swallow the red pill. You had as much knowledge as Neo and the narrative setup was almost as if you were on the adventure with him as well. Therefore, the narrative had to do a lot of the heavy lifting. Basically, behaviorism is driving a lot of the plot while adding nothing original.One of the other problems is that it is a much more personal and selfish Matrix movie. One of the trends that I noticed with some recent Hollywood movies is that there is such a focus on the personal and it is devoid of the societal intrigue that surrounds it. One good example is comparing the new Dune from Denis Villenueve to the Dune from David Lynch that came out in the 80s. Villenueve's Dune was much more of a microstudy because it was essentially a coming of age story surrounding the prince. What it particularly lacked from David Lynch's version was the fact that societal intrigue and political context that gave relevancy and gravity to the way that the prince develops. In The Matrix, all you really get Neo's story as he comes to grasp with the truth yet again and his romance arc with Trinity as he attempts to rescue her. What is noticeably absent is a lot of the events that happened in Matrix Online (the true first sequel to Matrix 3) and some of the events referenced in the movie itself. The humans and the machines' peace did not last long and it would have been interesting to see how that has become undone. It would have been interesting to see exactly how Morpheus's idealism has lead to the downfall of Zion and lead to the need for a new city. Instead, we are subjected to this romance action thriller. The problem is that the stakes do not feel as huge as they do in the first three movies. If Neo had failed in the trilogy, humanity's remnants felt at stake. Nothing really feels at stake here. Also, nobody really dies here and we get a very Hollywood style happy ending where Neo and Trinity reunite. The romance arc felt kind of rushed because after not seeing each other for what was like 60 years, they are suddenly in love again like nothing happened. While we get to see Neo's perspective, Trinity's life throughout the time is mostly absent and we don't get to see what her struggles were in order to reach the understanding that she came to by the end of the movie. Whereas the Matrix movies from the trilogy were much more zoomed out and focused on the macro, this new one focused too much on the micro.To an extent, I was entertained. This is certainly not the worst movie that I ever saw. It had some very good ideas, but the execution was incredibly flawed. I particularly liked the contrasts between the new main villain ""The Analyst"" that is in control of the ""new"" Matrix and ""The Architect"" that was in control of the ""old"" Matrix. They represent two very different visions of how to control humanity through The Matrix and get energy. I thought that Neil Patrick Harris was a really good villain and I like the vibe that he brought. However, that is offset by the ""phone it in"" Keanu Reeves performance as Neo because it does not even look like he was trying that much or seemed interested. When people say ""Cash Grab"", I'm sure Keanu Reeves's performance should be coming to mind. The action scenes were generic, but relatively decent. I really liked the motorcycle scene toward the end of the movie. However, it certainly pales in comparison to the highway car chase that you see in the middle of the second Matrix movie. Those action scenes are usually enough to keep you entertained.I think that this movie potentially sets up a new trilogy where maybe these ideas can be explored and executed a lot better, but this movie ultimately falls short. When it rehashes too much of the trilogy, the problem is that the new philosophical ideas that will help to move the franchise forward as a whole are not really there. A part of the Matrix movies is to leave your mind with intense philosophical questions. In a lot of senses, this is very far removed from a Matrix movie with how the narrative and the philosophy is set up. I think that the cool action scenes are really a smokescreen to distract you from how hollow the movie is at its core and I think it deserves nothing more than 5. I think it is a well-made movie for sure, but those first 30 minutes of those ""meta"" jokes are truly nauseating and almost made me want to stop watching the movie. Perhaps without the first 30 minutes, I would have been able to justify giving the movie a 6. However, that is just not the reality and you have a barely watchable movie and that's about it.",5
3853,"Bringing it all back for a fourth movie was 99/100 doomed to fail, but this was a masterpiece. Honoring the trilogy and yet taking the story in a whole new direction that is organic, and when you see it, you'll say to yourself ""of course! I never thought of that, so simple"" With all respect to the actors who gave wonderful performances, this was all Lana.",9
3854,"Omg how should i explain how bad it is. Story is so bad and confusing, lost me in 20 mins. Just utter nonsense and garbage. Writing more just to add review of how bad it is.",1
3855,"If you watch the Matrix trilogy right before you watch Matrix Resurrections, you will have a good time. You will not be lost or confused. I really enjoyed this movie. It's not among the best movies I've ever seen which is why I give it the rating that I did.",7
3856,"Directed and written by Lana Wachowski. Starring and reprising their roles Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss as ""Neo"" and ""Trinity"". If you don't know anything about ""The Matrix"" movies it was a trilogy about humans being in a simulation of sorts called the Matrix and machines used humans as natural batteries, feeding off of them while hooked up to this simulation.""Neo"" Keanu Reeves character was the ""One"" the person who was sent to change the game, no pun intended and free the human race from the control of the machines. It was a action packed man vs machine movie, with a love story in the middle of it. Something that was super out there and grew to be a cult classic.But after the trilogy ""Trinity"" and ""Neo""died. But in ""The Matrix Resurrections"" they're back. You find out what happened after there so called death. Everyone from the originals are back at least name wise but with different actors playing some of the roles because it's a different version of themselves you could say. Now with different problems and agendas going on one thing is consistent. The love ""Neo"" and ""Trinity"" have for one another. This film is about them trying to find a way to be together while dealing with and trying to find their footing in todays Matrix.This film is every where. The first hour puts you in a constant confused face. It had great actors like Yahya Abdul-Mateen ll who played ""Morpheus"", Jada Pinkett Smith reprising her role as a well seasoned ""Niobe"" now, Lambert Wilson coming back as ""The Merovingian"", and with new comers Jessica Henwick playing ""Bugs"", Priyanka Chopra Jonas playing ""Sati"" and Neil Patrick Harris playing the Villian ""The Analyst"".The talent is there but wether it was making fun of its own self but also explaining what's going on makes life extra confusing. They had so many great ideas like Bots, and using the mirrors as portals amongst other things but it was so mind boggling and not in a good way. Even writing this it's hard to explain because you just have to see the madness for yourself.I saw where Lana Wachowski dad passed away then, a close friend and a month later her mother. That's a lot of loss in a short period of time. I know how it feels to lose a mother but not lose significant people, your parents one after the other. Lana was hurting bad. She found her self just writing a story of bringing these famed characters back to life. Yea it's not practical but it felt good to bring someone back from the dead.Lana approached her sister Lilly who co directed/write the trilogy with Lana but she didn't want to grieve that way. At the end of it she wrote something wild and crazy. Lana used it to feel better and help her grieve. This movie was never going to get made and only got made because of the tragic losses in her life. Lana gave her finish work to the powers that be and they made it happen. So after learning all that it puts things in perspective. She didn't have her sister this go around and was used for something completely different.""Matrix"" has glimpses of really cool action sequences. Them bringing back the main characters feels good, along with old villains/characters was Nostalgic. I wish they found a way to bring back Laurence Fishburne.Maybe with more thought behind it or focusing on one of the many things going on would come across better. This isn't John Wick, Keanu kind of feels to old to be playing this, at least how it was done. I never age shame but he just seemed stiff the whole movie.I'm extremely happy this helped Lana grieve but when it comes to the movie, bits and pieces of cool scenes here and there don't do it for me. It just leaves the audience scratching there head in confusion while noticing the mass potential.I watched ""The Matrix Resurrections"" on HBOMAX, you can also watch it in theaters. With the pandemic surging this is not worth going to the movies to see which hurts me to say. I watched the first ""Matrix"" with my mom and was blown away. When we heard they were not only doing a second and third movie, but they were filming them at the same time we couldn't wait in excitement. But my mom passed away and we never got to see the sequels together. I give ""The Matrix Resurrections"" two more fires 🔥🔥SB (Side bar) I would still love to see a prequel with Michael B. Jordan playing a young ""Morpheus.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin#CosmoMovieBlog#CosmoLanier#TheMatrixResurrections.",5
3857,"For the first 40-or-so minutes, i kept hoping i would discover that this movie is intended as an outright parody of the Matrix, but it's not. This is actually what they give us as a ""continuation"". From the outright idiotic looking and behaving characters to the story that... is mediocre at the very best, to the overall feel of the movie, this is complete and utter trash, hardly qualifies even as a B-movie. It looks as if it's made exclusively to milk the franchise cow just a bit more if possible, or worse, to make a mockery of the original trilogy.",2
3858,"Neo and Trinity are back and alive! I loved first Matrix movie very much and i love this one also, i like it even more than second and third Matrix movie, but first is still the the one, at least for me.",10
3859,"This film shouldn't have happened and it has tarnish one of the best trilogies ever made.Resurrections lacks the seriousness of the original (while being overly pumped with clips from the original and copying the first film in too many ways), is full of useless dialogue and has been made into a gimmick. A lot of the supporting roles weren't believable and appeared to be more like fans of the Matrix than actually part of that world.Bringing characters back from the dead who sacrificed themselves for humanity needs to happen in a believable way within that world to justify it. And this doesn't do it. Clear cash grab.If you can ignore the titanic sized plot holes, the dull dialogue and the lack of Laurence Fishburne. Prepare yourself for a Matrix that reads more like a new transformers.",2
3860,"Reminded me of Star Wars 7, take the original, copy it a bit and add a bunch of stuff to make it a comedy show, left the theater after half an hour. Do not waste you time, dont go in there for nostalgia, you will regret it.",1
3861,"It would be so great if producer could bring back Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne to reprised their characters in the previous Matrix trilogy. Replacing Agent Smith and Morpheus characters by another actors made this movie failed to satisfy all of Matrix movie fans. Also feels like I am watching John Wick who enter a world of Matrix, but lack of martial art acts. Keanu couldn't gave his best performance to reprise his role, unlike in the previous trilogy.",6
3862,"I went into this with very low expectations after seeing the imdb score. I'm pleased to say I was pleasantly surprised.I loved seeing the old characters and where they end up, especially the crazy French dude yelling critiques at modern society and when agent Smith remembers who he is and yells MR ANDERSON I got goosebumps all over me remembering one of my favorite childhood movies. Nostalgia at its finest.The only real problem I have with the movie is how poor bots are at aiming, the main characters don't even have to try to evade their bullets they'll miss anyway. I mean it's Stormtrooper level incompetence.Is Matrix Resurrections revolutionary as the first installment? No. Is it better than parts 2 and 3? Yes. Well worth the watch.",9
3863,"To start there's obviously a lot of people complaining about this movie but I don't actually agree with them.In Summary:The movie is not up-to-par with the original but in it's own way is basically just a recap/revised repeat of the first movie with the intention of pushing along the overall storyline. In the end it was way better than I was expecting.Preface of my review:The original movie was great and the sequential movies were not so much. I believed the order in which they were released also reflected their quality. I can appreciate all of the movies but I'm not a die hard fan either.The Breakdown:1. Neyo's story was an interesting take and I liked how it was constructed in a way that's believable and mirrored his original story arch.2. Trinity was interesting and her usage in the movie felt like the right amount.3. The new morpheus made sense once you understood what exactly he/it is.4. The new villain was honestly a believable take on the machines and reflected their overall purpose for the matrix &amp; the humans.5. The end definitely solidified the movie as a surprisingly good one.The Good:1. Reeves is great! Neyo has aged and it reflects some in his abilities and the need for trinity makes sense.2. I like what they did with the power duo and how it ended. Also how they draw their powers makes sense.3. A huge heavy reliance on the first movie made it easier to follow this one and understand how we got to this movie and how it all comes together.4. You don't actually need to know any of the sequential movies to be able to follow the storyline in this one. It would definitely help but its not actually necessary.5. I like how this new matrix was developed and ultimately how they were able to contain the chosen one and trinity. It's believableThe Bad:1. If you ""watch the movie"" and also play on your phone or have sidebar conversations or don't pause to use the restroom you will most likely be lost.2. The new characters don't really matter at all to me but that's okay because the main focus wasn't even them.3. They brought back some villains that basically just didn't fit to the movie I felt like and instead where just an easy cameo for fandoms of them.4. The main reason why neyo and trinity can exist again makes sense but at the same time sounds sort of a stretch given how much the machines want control why would they even leave the chance for them to cause trouble again?Ending thoughts:It was surprisingly good! I'd rewatch it and probably will end up rewatching it. To me the matrix storyline could literally start with the original and then skip to this movie. It wasn't as action packed as the other movies were but I think its main job this time was to reboot the saga or ""resurrect"" it while continuing the past storyline. For the die hard fans they will probably pick it apart until they hate it and for regular fans they will either like it like me or they will be more neutral about it. For the modern day movie go-er who plays on their phones during movies they will hate this movie because they wont pay enough attention to appreciate and understand it.",7
3864,"Okay so this movie is banking on the fact you love nostalgia. The movie starts off very weird and basically saying that the matrix movies where video game created by neo himself inside the matrix until he frees he mind yet again. And the only reason he wants to is because of his love for Trinity which is fine because i love love but i dont know this movie misses the mark on it. If i would have chosen how this movie went i would have started the movie with neo back in the life he had before he exited the first time wanting to go back to his life forgetting that he ever took the red pill. The reason he does this is only because he wants to forget about Trinity and the love he had for her so he would rather live in a life he never knew her thinking that would be better. And instead of it being 60 years it is actually 15 and Morpheus is still alive. Morpheus comes back to find neo because a new A. I has started a new war and thus he needs neo to come back and help them win. The new A. I happens to be Smith building his code back up not being fully destroyed. Once Morpheus runs into neo, it brings back his memories and he is mad because he doesn't want to be let out but come to find out Trinity survived and the machines kept her alive after neo fought Smith but kept her once the war started. Now neo has to save her just like in this movie but in a different way and also making Smith the main bad guy. I heard that the actor had conflicts with timing but honestly i would rather them wait to bring him back instead of not having him at all. When Neo freed his mind the second time he would have a little time getting back into the swing of things and when he sees smith for the first time he is so enraged he would learn to fight again and is able to bend the laws of this new matrix even more then the first one. And this time the ending would be Neo and Trinity taking on Smith together for the first time really and then the both of them dying together for good finally ending the war for good.So overall the movie was not good but i think if they would have gone down the route i have written then it would have been better.",5
3865,Disappointed but not surprised. Really. Waited all this time to drop yet another #MeToo productionWhere the Wachowski Brothers go?! These sisters are wack.(SN: Could care less if someone is offended. Like really. SO. ),2
3866,"Pros:1-) The story expansion is remarkable.2-) The human real world details are based on current discussions about future. From that aspect, it is really very contemporary. The new state of machine-human interaction is very very futuristic!3-) The text and conversations that including programming terms and computer science are at a quite high level.Cons:1-) There are too much new details and flow is too fast. Many details are being covered so fastly and slightly because of movie length, despite it is too long. That is why, i couldn't understand clearly and feel to ""rewind"" at many points. This film absolutely should be 2 part! One 2,5 hour film is not enough to cover everything.2-) Fight scenes are not at an enough level. Both from amount and content aspects. Kung-Fu scenes are not enough attractive and artistic. Keanu Reeves was much more serial at Reloded and Revolution.3-) Tension is absolutely the most absent thing in this film in comparison with trilogy. The flow is going on a plain level. Level of energy is low generally.",7
3867,"Greetings Fellow Film Buffs. Lana Wachowski is credited with directing this film and for those of you who don't know both Lana and her sister, Lilly, were also credited for writing and directing the complete Matrix film series. Authors David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon had a hand in writing this new addition to the series. The Matrix franchise proved to be a major box office success and it is fair to say that this forth film was eagerly awaited by all sci-fi fans especially as Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss are to reprise their roles as Neo and Trinity respectively. Yes, I know Trinity died in the last film but don't worry the latest sequel explains everything you need to know including a return by Morpheus now played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.. The new Mr. Smith played by Jonathan Groff. Struggles to be quite as menacing as his predecessor.You can't help feeling Warner Bros. Wanted an evolution to the Matrix Universe and here we see Reeves as a brilliant video game programmer, Thomas Anderson, working on a sequel to his game called the ""Matrix"" and these ideas come from taking the blue pill daily. You remember in the 1999 film he took the red pill, the difference being, ""The ""red pill"" and ""blue pill"" are a choice between the willingness to learn potentially unsettling or life-changing truths (red) or remaining in contented ignorance (blue)."" This new movie wants to reunite the Neo/Trinity love story and provide endless philosophy to explain the blurring of reality and dreams in the Matrix although this does not not translate into entertainment. Much of this philosophising conceals the reality that the film is not really headed in any one direction. Although there is an interesting scene where Neo visits his therapist, played by Neil Patrick Harris, who tries to analyse our understanding of the Matrix. Yes there is plenty of action with lots of cool people in sunglasses with impressive guns all shot in the traditional style of the Matrix films often doubling up with slow mo replays.I am still unsure what Warner Bros. Had in mind and why this story had to be told but it is the weaker of the series and not essential to have watched the earlier films first. Nevertheless I think we can forgive Wachowski this small glitch in her career. ""Sense8"" was very popular with fans and don't forget the earlier Matrix films became a major influence for action movies in this genre. Despite my comments, ""The Matrix Resurrections"" is still watchable and I have given it five stars under the IMDb rating system.",
3868,"You can tell they were really banking on having all the stars return with the script, Lawrence Fishbourne's absence and replacement kinda works cuz they establish him as a new character, but it doesn't work at all for Hugo Weaving's absence. Especially with the call backs like ""just like old times"" in their fight. It's not like old times cuz who even are you? You're some new actor that has no background other than ""I am Agent Smith now by the way"" and we're supposed to just go with it. It doesn't work at all.As for the rest, they literally have a Matrix 4 reboot meeting inside the film Matrix 4 which is pretentious and I remember during the big fight scene thinking ""this is like a Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV fight scene"" which isn't good considering that was a TV show and this supposed to be a blockbuster movie.",4
3869,"Honestly, I'm a fan of Wachowski movies. I think they're special filmmakers - unconventional and somewhat profound. From The Matrix to Cloud Atlas to Jupiter Ascending, and even the much maligned Matrix Revolutions I've found them all brilliantly intriguing. However, The Matrix Resurrections is a different movie.It differs so much from its original trilogy the only commonalities they share are their titles and characters. This movie looks modern, polished, and very in the times - a whole lot more than the trilogy that precedes it but it unfortunately, ends up feeling much cheaper and very conventional.There's some beautiful CGI and Visual Effects, some of which is entirely impressive. So the movie looks good enough and properly 2021. It also presents concepts that shine and introduce some new ideas or implementations of AI programs in cinema. And this is one of only a few positives the movie offers - positives are few and far between. While, it also does an OK job of representing aspects of our current world within the context of The Matrix.The movie certainly doesn't take itself too seriously. It does not try to be revolutionary and while that could have been a plus, in the end, it plays out negatively. The plot is weak, sterile and unexciting. Its action sequences are poor and barring the casting of Neil Patrick Harris as The Analyst and Toby Onwumere as Seq most of the cast of the movie while talented - seem completely out of place, and uninspired. As if, they were simply - easy and convenient casting choices.Every Matrix movie from the original trilogy was about a world vast and deep, with consequences that carried a whole lot more purpose for everyone linked to that world including its audiences, this movie however is based upon simpler, less interesting, less impactful - terms. There's some sprinkling of profundity within The Matrix Resurrections but throughout the movie it seems to be battling with the depths and grandeur of its past so much that it fails, and cannot realize its purpose. It cannot escape the shadow of its predecessors, it does not separate itself from them, and it ends up being worse off as a result.It tries to do too much and explain too much all in one movie. So much so that this fourth installment alone could be a trilogy of its own, which I think would have helped the story and its characters - but here, everything is rushed and packed into this singular title that just ends up feeling a little ambitious but truly disjointed. While sometimes literally trying to recreate its past.This is probably not only the poorest Matrix movie but also the poorest and most meaningless Wachowski Movie. Perhaps, the point was to kill any hope, idea, or possibility of the franchise having a future. Because this is a lifeless, conventional, and unfortunate disappointment.",4
3870,"When I heard that this movie was coming out I immediately thought ""Ok, obvious cash grab!"", but NO! Let me assure you, this is not a hack job, the writers really had an idea, going in. This movie is so hard to describe, even for the majority of the runtime I didn't know what to make of it. It's the continuation of where the series left off, and it is trying to tie up loose ends (while creating others, naturally), but it has a lot of what I could only describe as ""fan fiction vibes"", and a big part of it is just Star Wars prequels levels of boring. No action, just talking. Until the almost end, the stakes are non-existent. Before the end there is a really fantastic action scene, one that could top any one from the previous movies, and you do get a feel for the stakes at that point, but it's not nearly enough to make this movie worthwhile. The story is nonsensical, for the most part, but the series accustomed us to that a long time ago anyways. Still, it makes even less sense than anything from before (what an achievement!). Keanu Reeves still speaks like he's talking to microbes on his chin and wants it to be a private conversation, so nothing has changed there also, in 20 years, but his acting is fine. They made Morpheus into a token black guy, with ""urban"" one liners (and quoting previous-movies Morpheus), which I didn't appreciate, but it's just an annoyance, something to pad out the movie to be 2h 30m long. I think my best summary would be ""The Architect scene in the 2nd (or 3rd?) movie, stretched for about 2h, with 30m of OK stuff and the kick-ass action scene near the end. Also, maybe some nostalgia for Carrie-Anne Moss? Last I saw her in anything she was the mother of Shia LaBeouf (*shudders*)",6
3871,Everyone who doesn't like this movie are easy there transphobic or dislikes the truth. The truth about our modern society and they are just ignoring the beauty of the film.,10
3872,"I can't remember the last time I left a theater as mad as I was when the credits rolled on this stinker. I'm a huge fan of the first movie, and even enjoy the first two sequels. (Though I always thought ep. 2 and 3 could be edited together to make one excellent movie.)Basically, this movie is a mess. I'm not sure what Lana was shooting for, but it makes me think she didn't really understand the first three movies. It's goofy self referential humor just doesn't work and the continuity and logic is all over the place. Can Neo fly? No... unless he tries harder. Humans are still power sources, even though that never made sense. I had such high hopes that we'd find out the real reason for the matrix, but I guess it's just stupid.",1
3873,"This movie, true to it's title, is a great resurrection of the series. The story is well thought out, modernized, yet still deep and captivating. I enjoyed every minute of it, and look forward to re-watching it many times.",10
3874,The main message was delivered. For those who have ears . Sadly all the rest was a big failure. All.I give 6 stars because it s still.... Matrix.And now let's talk about the sheeps and the core of the movie: we all agree education is the only solution ?... we all agree shortcuts are not possible and we just have to push on this only valid/logic direction?....ok. Agreed. Let's do it .,6
3875,"The Matrix movies are science fiction horror movies where sentient machines took over the earth, enslaved humans, the earth is destroyed, people die, the machines are in control and they barely let the small human resistance live.The Matrix Resurrections does not have the same tone. I guess they just decided to make an action popcorn flick.It's self aware, it breaks the fourth wall, and it seems to make fun of the original a little. It's too colorful (the green hue is gone) and too silly to be a Matrix movie.It didn't feel like they ever even tried to give anything any real weight to it like you had with the original (whether it was when Neo wakes up in the real world, or when he sees the code, etc). Everything just falls flat. I assumed the action scenes would be good, but not much of them were.The replacement for Laurence Fishburne doesn't work. The replacement for Agent Smith is okay I guess but I have no idea why Smith is in it with how they used him. I must have skipped a crucial scene, because one minute they were fighting tons of ""bots"" that Agent Smith set off...or something, the next they've somehow won and I guess Smith is just gone.I expected this movie to be better than it was. This is probably the worst of the sequels.5/10Hollywood, stop. Just stop.",5
3876,This was a great reboot I would skip the second and third and just go to this one. Great story a lot easier to follow that the the others.The Matrix is of course the best but this was really well done.,7
3877,"Given the disappointment of the 3rd instalment, this was what I needed for a final close of this movie series. Very well done. What a people complaining about? This won't end world hunger! I enjoyed the ride. Missed Laurence Fishburne. If we had Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith in this I would have rated it a solid 11/10! Sappy ending, but then who cares.",8
3878,"Seriously the worst Matrix movie. A poor attempt at making a ""happy ending"". Neo never returns to his ""the one"" status in any triumphant or satisfying way. And the blatant and shoe horned feminism is the end wasn't needed.",4
3879,"Obviously, this is setting up a reboot of the franchise but considering the execution of the first it probably won't make it that far. There's so much material to work with it's difficult to fathom why they chose to go this route. Between the MMORPG Matrix online, the Animatrix etc.. there was an entire series of plotlines/stories inside the universe to be explored. It seems to be an attempt to show the audiences a revamped original for younger viewers who have no memory, while attempting to explain away the plot-holes during the 20 year hiatus.Pros: The worlds developed which has allowed for an expansion of the plot &amp; certain themes(Mirrors instead of Phonebooths, Programs IRL ex.). They could've used computer explanations like ""Rolling restarts"", ""Kernel panic"", ""code compilation"" or ""bricking"" describe certain details; technical advisor would've helped but it's fine. Very polished GFX/VFX effects where they were called for, it was good to see bullet-time again. Strong nostalgia call-backs, alittle kitsch/campy sometimes but alright, very open ended allowing for growth. Alice in Wonderland allusions we're on point. Carrie Anne-Moss &amp; Keanu Reeves still have the chemistry that soft, calm, emotion not often found in Hollywood Romances.Cons: Too many tropes driving the plot forward ""Romance"" instead of philosophy. No Cyberpunk in the virtual world. The Merovingian was a crazy homeless guy, the dialogue consisted of tons of name-dropping/technical terms the actors didn't understand. They should've brought in John Wick/Yuen Woo-ping to do the martial arts choreography, the terrible fighting scenes from the cast underscores the absence of the Westerns elements that catapulted it to fame. They attempted to make-up; cover for this with unncessary special effects. Should've brought in some landmark famous electronic artists for the soundtrack: Brian Eno, Trent Reznor; there wasn't enough tension in the soundtrack like Don Davis brought which lessened the Drama/intensity.They took a generic B action film like Inception or Jumper &amp; dropped it in the Matrix brand. Hopefully with a tad of commerical success on their second try they can hit the mark with immaculate perfection.",6

3881,"So after eighteen years, The Matrix comes back with a fourth installment, now one has to wonder what in the world happened to how you actually make a film, though I maybe giving a better review plus rating than many others to this film cause the story of it is just perfect, you cannot bring back the world of The Matrix how it was left in the end of Revolutions, than this . But the vast majority of the people consider this film to be a complete disaster and they're wishing that they themselves had taken a pill 💊 😂 and gone to sleep rather than watch this film 🤣 .. and we can't blame them either because the construction of every scene of this film has been done so poorly that one might wonder, what happened to the makers of The Matrix, even I'm super shocked and surprised how this film turned out to be. I don't know .. maybe cause it had been delayed that's for sure cause of the viral pandemic . It's looking like the director Lana Wachowski has forgotten completely how to make films and is just playing with the camera, and making it something funny like how you have comedy retakes of movies on the Late show with Conan O'Brien . I think The Matrix originally had been directed by the Wachowski Brothers and plus The Matrix revolutionized the stop-motion capture technique in filmmaking, so for a sequel to be made of a movie with such a high standard and it turns out like this is a complete shame . The only saving grace is the story of this film. The rest is completely disastrous . The visuals are a complete wreck too. Unbelievable ..",6
3882,"This movie is way better than I expected, specially because of most reviews and overall grade here in IMDB.It brings a lot of scenes back from the trilogy as a kind of tribute, but also to help us remember what they're talking about, since the movies are all connected. The main elements of Matrix are still there: questioning existence, philosophy dilemmas, social criticism, awesome characters, great outfits, solid soundtrack and so on.I also loved the fact that the movie is aware of what it is: uses a lot of fan's theory's to explain the Matrix and it's universe and also criticizes itself when saying the industry only makes reboots because it's easy money. But most importantly, it has a nice plot and cool action scenes. Agent Smith is a bit too self-centered in this one, but I'll let it slide.It ends in a way that more matrixes can come. I enjoyed it, even though it could have been 30 minutes shorter.",8
3883,"If you are a Matrix fan who has enjoyed watching and rewatching the first three Movies a lot and you are looking for the fastest way to get depression, look no further.Watching this garbage will bring you permanent and untreatable psychological damage guaranteed.The God-like hero is turned into a tired old powerless pathetic loser.The rich and philosophically profound script is now replaced with ridiculous and unserious lines said by repelling characters with cheap personalities.What do I mean by ""cheap personality""?Well, the supposedly well-trained and high-ranked members of the resistance act like silly teenagers now. They say stupid things and make irrational decisions whereas even the actual teenage soldiers in the first three movies were very mature and understanding.The iconic green tone of the matrix world is now present only in some scenes that take place inside the matrix, in other inside the matrix scenes the producers were like: meh just leave that important detail out of it for no reason.The same is true for the blue tone of the real world and the yellow tone of the training program.The camera settings were terrible in almost every scene as if they intended to make it look bad!The ending is not just disappointing but also meaningless. It was as if the writers got tired halfway through their writing and said: screw it, let's just make some random BS up and end the movie here.I will try my best to forget everything I saw in that movie theater today and I advise anyone who reads this not to watch the movie.",1
3884,"If you know the lore behind the Matrix movies and you understand the deeper meanings, you will get what the movie is all about. And this movie require 2nd or 3rd viewing to fully have a proper understanding.At first, you will think the movie is making fun of itself and what came before it but that's what this movie wants you to think. Don't expect fancy action scenes as well because even though there are some great action scenes, they are only in the movie to complement the story.There are more than a few bad ideas in this movie. And some ideas are executed poorly but still this movie has its own merits to deserve its existence. I know for sure, most people won't get it first but later over the years, people will appreciate it more.So, please watch the prior movies before you watch this one and try to have an open mind while watching this. And remember it is a philosophical journey with some good action scenes and not a typical blockbuster action flick.",8
3885,"Okay, I'm an original 1998 The Matrix fan! Here's what I think. If you are an OG fan of the movie. You will absolutely love this movie! You get to see Neo and Trinity back in the Matrix!!! The story revolves around previous Matrix movies and you don't get lost with crazy new characters. It's solid. My only reason to give it an 8 over a 10 is the directing. You will see an obvious difference.",8
3886,"I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel and it is exactly how I'd imagine the story to be.We all know in Revolutions, Neo had to form an alliance with the machines to save Zion and finally put an end to Smith. So, what did you think would happen afterwards?Neo is returned to the Matrix and although it is a slow burn to get to the action, it's fine because it builds suspense. You get a feeling everything is not quite right with Neo back in the matrix and the 'balance' the machines are trying to keep. And so, the inevitable happens which is where the action kicks in. There's classic fight scenes, there's the sentinels, there's survivors, pretty everything you'd expect in a Matrix franchise.I did feel Keanu's portrayal of Neo had suffered somewhat and I just kept seeing John Wick because of the long hair and he dresses the same. It's also a shame Hugo Weaving isnt in it.. it left the doors open for another film and I hope there is!",6
3887,"The world wouldn't be much better or worse place without this movie. Of course, it is a nostalgia product, and the cut scenes from the trilogy were quite annoying.

3889,"I did not understand why people talked so negatively about this movie until I viewed it myself. Basically, what they did is they turned the ""epic sequel"" into a parody. When you introduce parody elements into an epic sequel, you just ruin it. If they think to have another Matrix, I will never watch it, since it cannot be any better than this. So Matrix 3 is still the last one.",1
3890,"Some of the movies should stay ended. After seeing I was thinking that it would be better without this one. Poor and sentimental story, something different than the others. I miss fighting scenes but Keanu, a very good actor is not for this anymore. Hope this will stop here.",6
3891,"I went in with low expectations and was at first surprised by the shift in tone of the new movie.From a technical standpoint it was awfully executed, the humor was just too cringy and the film lacks of almost everything that made the first movie very enjoyable. It aims to criticize endless reboot culture but fails to deliver a better alternative. Instead it feels even weaker than other movie reboots (like Star Wars etc) in the end.I felt a little bit heartbroken coming out of the cinema.Not like this... :-(",3
3892,If you think how bad could it be.... here is my answer after I whatched Matrix 4 - that was the badest movie I ever whatched and totally waste of time!!!,1
3893,"A boringly shot and directed film that cannot go 5 minutes without mocking the viewer for wanting a better movie. This ""film"" strips away everything entertaining in the first 3 films to tell a milquetoast love story that contantly contradicts itself. Not even worth pirating, I hope this film dies an ignoble death.",3
3894,"The Matrix film series has been a part of my childhood, and I think most '90s kids could say the same thing. The original movie (released all the way back in 1999) would go on inspiring movies as diverse as Charlies Angels (2000) and Inception (2010), and there's not much I can say about it here that hasn't been said elsewhere. It's the Citizen Kane of cyberpunk, a mind-boggling mix of Cartesian philosophy and martial arts. Movies such as this must have sequels, and, after two arguable installments, the series was thought to have come at an end. The story had spin-offs in other media like comic books and video games, but the directors seemed committed to never opening the Matrix door again. And now, after nearly two decades, when news of a fourth installment surfaced, it was mind-boggling in its own right. The most important question was: Can you take a long-over series and release a fourth movie, and still make it good? The trailer did look promising, and a detailed analysis of it by a YouTuber suggested an immensely complicated story that had to be designed from the ground up, while making sure you get as much reference of the old trilogy as possible. Does The Matrix Resurrections (or M4, for short), succeed in doing that? After finishing the movie on the same day it came out, and giving it some time to settle in my head, I'd say, it largely does.The movie starts with a puzzling scene which looks like an almost shot-for-shot remake of the opening sequence of the first Matrix movie. There we meet an Agent, who soon realises he is more than that, and has a different destiny to fulfill. Meanwhile, Neo is living a troubled existence as a super successful game developer. His most popular game-guess what-is ""The Matrix"", and there's pressure to release a 4th installment of the game (by Warner Bros, no less). Neo keeps visiting his therapist, who prescribes him a boatload of blue pills (for all intents and purposes, the same blue pill one takes in order to stay in the Matrix, oblivious to reality). Neo has aged, he is socially awkward, and is much less lively than even the pale, nervous Thomas Anderson of the first movie. Sometimes he sees Trinity where he goes to dine. Soon enough, people who have already awakened to the real world intervene, and Neo's life changes-once again.The first half of the movie is beautiful in its self-references, the meta-analysis of how studios go on making sequels of a popular franchise, what the story of the Matrix actually stood for... And at the same time, it also resurrects most of its memorable main characters. The first half of the movie is built like a carefully designed piece of self-explaining program: why the movie exists, and what, if any, point it might have. That part is thoroughly enjoyable, and it satisfyingly fulfills the yearnings of aging nerds like me who see the same favourite actors of their childhood (themselves aging) come forward and do something new with an old-but-not-dead story.The latter half, though, may have left some of the yearnings unfulfilled. That is not to say the movie didn't try: it was so easy and simple for M4 to slip and slide down the steep hill of meaningless reboots. One of the original directors, Lana Wachowski, undoubtedly tried her best to make something meaningful out of this new sequel. The movie had a way of avoiding complexity, and sometimes maybe that approach wasn't the best. The character of Agent Smith, resurrected in a whole different manner, could have served a little more purpose. Was the main antagonist a bit cliché? Maybe. But the movie, like a flying Neo, can rise above these apparent shortcomings.When I first watched the trilogy, Facebook didn't exist. I barely had an internet connection. In all these years, the world has dramatically changed. Let's face it: we are living in the Matrix of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Tiktok. In a lot of ways, watching one of the Matrix movies is a lot like watching a loose adaptation of our own world. Lana Wachowsk seems to have considered that, and the social media and smartphone references in the movie, while not too obvious, are meaningful and sharp. The post-credit scene, while comic in nature, posed a very serious question in my mind: are movies really dead? In a world full of mini cat videos, one has to wonder.",7
3895,"A copy - paste movie its not a movie a 5 year old kid would have made a better production with their limited knowledge and our current technology.The film was so big for the producers, the management and quality of the cameras the performance I mean the actors are good but the producersIt could have been a great movie and even the beginning of more sequels but I think this is the end. So sad!",4
3896,"I have enjoyed the movie, full of action and some epic scenes. It's not perfect, but definitely worth watching. All the bad reviews kept me doubting, but I am glad that I went.",8
3897,"The first couple Matrix movies were the best. The series went downhill from there. This one killed the series. In short they basically gave Superman his powers and then took them away in this installment and gave them to his girlfriend. Movies such as this are where people look for escapism and entertainment from the ""real"" world but this film fails to achieve either. This is why I've always hated sequels and prequels. Hollywood looks to cash in and make a quick buck on a movie that was popular by cranking out a piece of junk sequel or prequel that shouldn't have been made in the first place. Instead make one really good movie and move on. Dreams other dreams. Better ones.",3
3898,"This was painful to watch and even harder to understand that The Matrix is never coming back. If you are a fan of the movies, I beg you don't watch this; let your memories be good memories of these movies. This sequel will ruin it all for you, and you will regret watching this. It's like finally getting to sleep with the hottest chick in school only to find out she's horrible in bed. I'm not even sure why I gave this 3 stars, since of loyalty I guess. The absolutely brutally slow fight choreography is by far the hardest to watch. Makes Keanu seem even older then he looks. This was like watching Deja vu with beer goggles from hell.",3
3899,"OMG .. Absolutely loved it . In the first half .. This movie was narrating itself while progressing. Dialogue exchanges were pretty Cool.Each concept of a scene and the implementation of that concept in the scene was perfect. Several colors used in the color palette but do take into consideration the use of colors Blue, Red, Orange, Green and Black.Visual Effects, Sound Effects and the Soundtracks were mindblowing. This movie at some point actually almost had me convinced there is no Matrix, Neo (The Game Developer) has gone completely crazy. It almost had me convinced I'm losing my mind.This movie was way more tripper than the best trippest movies out there .. trippy movies to mention a few would be ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""The Truman Show"", ""The Number 23"", ""Stranger Than Fiction"", ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Free Guy"".""The Matrix Resurrections"" is a Spontaneous, Refreshing, Fast Paced, Self Contained Escapade. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍",10
3900,"There is nothing here worth watching. No connections to interesting philosphical or meta physical ideas, no high octane gunplay, impressively terrible fight scenes. There's nothing that made the other movies great. The story was a convoluted mess that was purposefully disrespectful when referencing the previous movies. The only part of this movie that I found enjoyable was the fact that I watched it from my couch.Please don't waste your time, it's unrelentingly awful.",1
3901,"The first movie changed cinema forever more than twenty years ago, combining eastern martial arts, big budget weapon blowouts, and a question often asked by many people; What if my life wasn't my life, what if I woke up and was strong enough to fly?I was incredibly excited upon seeing the first trailer with this small lingering worry that I'd be in for a rehash. Many studios are stuck replaying their old hits without having the boldness or talent to create something new, resulting in this film. My enthusiasm for Resurrections capsized almost twenty minutes in. Everything after that felt like a chore to watch.I enjoy the original film, and even parts of the sequels, but I don't really count this movie as canon. It does next to nothing new, and whatever fresh ideas or new characters that are introduced seem hollow. It was nice seeing Neo and Trinity again on the big screen, but I just hope it was done in a sharper, mor poignant way.",5
3902,The story line sucks it's kinda like the 4th movie wasnt involved with the first 3....they didnt bring everyone back and they could have done a better job...the gaming aspect and the action scenes didnt live up to the hype of the first 3 movies underwhelming.,5
3903,"All those other mediocre streaming service movies on the market. Dunno why there's such a negative buzz about this movie.Love the first one, rating m-4 as 2nd best and then part 2 &amp; 3.",10
3904,"So, I don't leave many reviews , I just score the movies and leave it at that. Normally.OK so it's not terrible. It just doesn't feel.....right somehow. The ideas and some of the set pieces are cool. The acting from Keanu and Carrie is actually pretty cool it just doesn't seem to all gel together. Basically it's a solid 6 just for the ideas and some of the set piecess6. But at the crux of it all it doesn't feel......right.Just my thoughts.",6
3905,"I am a fan of The Matrix original trilogy (plus the Animatrix) and I truly loved the new installement of the franchise. Looking at reviews here I somehow feel that some of the reviewers did not fully invest into the plotline to truly appreciate the genious of this piece of storytelling. The film manages to remain fresh and engaging while appealing to the fans of the original trilogy and building upon its greatness. It masterfully blends fun and originality, continuously breaking the hypothetical fourth wall with taking the story to a new level. In addition to the franchise's sweetheart ""What is reality?"", we also get a good dose of the more intimate ""What is sanity?"" and the trendy ""Is there fredom of choice?"". The theme of love that was there all throughout the previous movies gets the deserved spotlight in the new part. This works well, and although I can see how some may consider a few moments ""cringy"" or ""too meta"", the story is very organic, considering all the details subtly sprinkled into various dialogues, details that also to some extent address the questions about the machines raised by some of the other reviewers (trying to keep this spoiler-free).I think Lana did a wonderful job by giving us a piece of nostalgia, at the same time venturing into a completely new brighter-""slapstick""-self-irony territory, away from the signature dark-green world of the previous movies. She did this while managing to keep things very relevant, intact, fresh and still quite mind-bending.On another note, while all the actors did a fantastic job, it was especially heartwarming to see the cast of Sense8 reunited in the world of The Matrix. They maintained the sparkling chemistry from the series and seemingly effortlessly appropriated the franchise universe.Overall this is a film definitely worth watching and I cannot wait to see it again soon.",9
3906,Forget you nerds this movie was tight! Get over yourselves. Also my review is too short so I'm a writing more characters. So go Forget your boring wanna be critic ass life. Neo and trinity forever!,10
3907,"Look, I have no problems with the idea of self deprecating humor. I use it all the time myself.However, when a movie CONSTANTLY shoves into your face irony and meta in jokes, it starts to ware really quick. To the point where after the first few instances it felt cringy and painful watching anymore. Like watching a washed up comic give a live performance in a stadium.Additionally the fight choreography just wasn't impressive. Slow motion was overly used to the point it killed any semblance of immersion to movie was building.There's a lot of interesting concepts and I like the direction the movie went....but the execution was absolutely horrid. It also includes many of the flaws in the Matrix sequels, including clunky dialog and overly long and meandering scenes.The acting by everyone except Jessica Henwick was from meh to terrible, with the worst offender being Keanu. His performance was atrocious frankly. It seems he was reading lines as they came along and forgot to have any semblance of natural acting, with every line delivered is a stoner-like awkward fashion. It doesn't help that the central plot point and theme of the movie is handledIt's a shame really....there's a really cool movie that explores central themes of control, human need for conformity, and understanding the blurring lines between reality and fiction. The initial premise of Neo not knowing what's real or not would have been interesting if it was fleshed out the entire movie. It's like the people in charge of the movie had very deliberate buttons they wanted to press...but deliberately didn't want to challenge the audience. Which is like a tease.",3
3908,"I have watched it twice to get a better perspective of what this movie is about. I can't say I enjoyed the complicated tangle they did with making the original Matrix movies appear to be just a franchise that was created and that Warner Brothers was going to do a fourth installment ""With or without them"" as the new Agent Smith explains. This shatters any emersion of trying to absorb this world as a movie goer as it shatters any reality they were going for. It's like they hare their own franchise and want to make fun of it like a parody of the Matrix. Also disappointed they did not try to get the original actors to come back for this movie, for Agent Smith and Morphious. But lets be honest that is the least of this movies problems. Don't get me wrong there are some good moments in the movie and I liked the new style of Architect he was actually quite good! So at the end of all this Neo is no longer the one as there is now TWO. Now Trinity is also the one as well. Or perhaps there was always supposed to be the Yin Yang dynamic in the first place.",6
3909,"Amazing recap - amazing retro insert caractherDefinitively a nice way to reboot it.It bring back all the story , definitively made association with new actor as old one more easier and really well integrate with the old story.I dont get the so low rating anywhere close to what i have experience but as a fan and as futur viewer i am most of all really looking foward to the next one.",9
3910,"I would give this film a 6.8 or a 6.9. For me the first film was a solid 9.5, the second was an 8, and the third a 6. The point of me saying this is that I can't agree with people who say this this is an ""abomination"" or that it has ""ruined the legacy"" - I think in terms of creativity, imagination and vision, it actually exceeds Matrix Revelations. Having said that...One of my problems with this film is the shift in tone. What I particularly enjoyed about the original movies was that there always seemed to be subtle undertones that created a darker, more ominous mood. There were moments of genuine tension (I'm thinking Mr Anderson on the phone to Morpheus in the first movie, following instructions on how to flee his office and the approaching agents. Or Smith finding his way into the real world, 'disguised' as Bane) whereas in ""Resurrections"", these particular elements seem to have been replaced with a lighter, more jovial tone. I'm not against that necessarily, but at times this film felt less like a Matrix reboot - and more like a Marvel movie.On the flip side, I really liked the way in which they brought the main characters back. In advance of watching I was slightly afraid that it might just be a case of ""the peace with the machines has ended, and there's only one man who can prevent another war"" - and I couldn't have been more wrong. I like the way that they've evolved the matrix itself, and I thought the overall concept was super imaginative. At times however, our reintroduction to this world and the explanation of the new storyline did feel slightly rushed. It almost felt like the writers were bombarding you with lots and lots and lots of information very quickly as they knew they only had two-and-a-half hours, and didn't want to waste too much of the story on the explanation itself.As a huge Matrix fan however, I actually liked the 'nostalgia trip' elements of this movie. It seems a lot of people felt that it was a little cheap and over the top, but I enjoyed those moments. I think they made sense given that the entire concept of the film is about trying to trigger the memories of the main two characters - first Neo, and later Trinity - therefore it seemed logical that we'd witness plenty of moments that served as 'recalls' or 'throwbacks'. I particularly like the fact that, for the most part, the music felt true to the original films. I felt that the score worked well.Overall, there were many things I enjoyed about this movie, and there were some aspects that I didn't like at all. It was definitely flawed in many ways, and didn't come close to reaching the levels of the first two Matrix films. Having said that, it felt good to be back in this little world once again, and as far as I'm concerned - it wasn't a failure, and it certainly didn't take anything away from the original trilogy. Even if it ends up being a one-off, for me, a one-off movie that takes us back to the matrix for 150 minutes or so - even if it's not up to the same standards as the trilogy - is considerably better than having nothing at all.",7
3911,"Love the tone in this one, the fresh ideal silicon valley vibe tone then back to the dark black and green vibe. The story it self is interesting and I find it pretty easy watching and the action is nottt boring ( I ussuall skip fighting sequence this days). And thee cgi is gooodd its lovely and doesn""t look cheap, except the dojo in the water, a bit too perfect and ""plasticy"". Anyhow it was fun!",9
3912,"After all these years the first Matrix is still the best movie in the series but if you liked Matrix 2 and 3 then you won't be dissapointed. The story was interesting(although it was more like side-story when compared to trilogy), i liked all the nostalgia stuff and callbacks to previous films, the humour was suprisingly well done and it didn't feel insulting to the series and i think they explained a lot of what happened since the trilogy took place really well. What i didn't like was the action scenes, because come on - It's MATRIX - where almost everything is possible, they could be a little bit more creative, Neo could be more creative.",7
3913,Original Matrix trilogy is done justice. The revamp has added new story and new meaning to a franchise built on a great concept for a movie. After understanding the changes occurring throughout the film and what opportunities it provided for any following movies has me more excited then the originals.,8
3914,"A good sequel for our times, spelling out its callbacks in a similar manner to a Stewart Lee routine, ruminating on means of control and the society of the spectacle in a more amusing manner than the other 2 sequels. Use of same effects techniques as the Mandalorian gives it a slick look. If you saw the other sequels you'll watch this. What choice do you have?",7
3915,"Remember the final scene at the end of the last Harry Potter movie, where they're all old? This new Matrix movie feels like two and half hours of that. It feels like a final thought of an epic tale that was tacked on afterwords. There isn't anything iconic about this movie, ie no memorable moments (thinking of the shootout in the lobby from the OG Matrix and the freeway chase from Matrix Reloaded).It's just there.",3
3916,"This movie is so bad that I lost interest 20 minutes into the film. They tried way too hard and referred scenes from the first movie way too many times. It was the same thing as the last three movies a repetition of them entering the matrix only to be found by the suits and then a big fight breaks out. I seriously was questioning myself to whether I was watching a UFC fight or this movie. I also thought the consistency was terrible, how could a person be injured by a punch to the chest but not by falling off a building?? The last 45 minutes of the movie I seriously wanted to fast forward to the end to see what actually happened because the whole plot line was so messy you never knew what was happening the whole movie. The ending of the movie was very unclear and we have no idea as an audience if the sentinels are destroyed or how Trinity and Neo are going to build a new world??? I was very invested in the trilogy of these movies and was looking forward for months for the fourth movie and not even 30 minutes into it I couldn't care less. Save yourself the time and watch something else. I don't know if the Director directly told Keanu Reeves to act like he had some form of ADHD or autism because he literally couldn't speak without twitching or slurring his words. Maybe he just never knew his lines. This movie was so bad.",1
3917,I thought it was brilliant but see for yourself. The only way I can comprehend the bad reviews is that this movie touches a nerve. Something hidden deep within that we don't want to admit. This world is insane whether you admit it or not.,10
3918,"The movie started well with a mysteries, and kept revealing them at first. It had funny references to the first movies. It had great new elements as the new Morpheus and Bugs. But then, ..... the movie got too long with useless fights.... and it seems to lack worth purpose and motivations for the characters. On the positive sides it had elements from the 3 original movies, the mystery and discovery from the first, the charcters and complex conversation from the second and the technology and real world from the third. However, it could have been better.",7
3919,"Another masterpiece for The Matrix. Complex, unpredictable, good fights, some humor and a love story. I love how they made new ""bad"" guys, new machines, new Zion, Lana W is masterful. Not sure why so many bad reviews, maybe they didn't understand the Matrix story??? IDK. I want to see again got put the puzzle together a little better.Well done, and I hope they make more Matrix movies.",8
3920,"First 25 minutes dragged me in the story and i thought ""ok i get it, not bad story choice"" but than, Oh man, suddenly it ruins the entire universe.Firstly ; scenes were too long to watch that u battle yourself to not to distract, at one point i literally looked fot a remote to skip some (watched in theatre)Second; even the scenes are long they did not give us any background about anything, for example there is a new city now but we dont know how it happened, its just ""this is our new city and we grow strawberries"" thats it! And this lack of detail is all over the movie, who are new characters and etcThird and the final is being a coward in the universe they created. There is a huge universe in your palms and they keep giving us same things over and over again, i mean u can tell oracales story, u can tell zion's story, u can tell architech, key maker or or my fav ""the french"" plesure guys story , but no of course its still neo and his learning to fly thing again.

3922,"As before, this is a weave of philosophy, the human condition, mind and emotion. The film teaches us how to self reflect, sometimes in a self deprecating way but also serious about our future. It gives a poignant look at how our society has evolved in the twenty two years since The Matrix arrived. It can be nostalgic, but also reminding us also that our time here is limited.I suspect this film is, as it says, targeting only the 1% of people who think deeply about their existence. Therefore IMDB reviews may give low mean values. However, like the original matrix, hopefully a cult following and greater understanding of it's message will lead to broader appreciation in the future.Thank you Lana.",10
3923,"Polarizing film. I left the viewing feeling underwhelmed but not necessarily filled with regret. If it has to exist like this, I'm glad I got to see it. Honestly there were far better and far worse ways to pull this off and yet here we are.The meta aspects are fun, the dopey bits are fun, they really lean into these aspects because of the nature of self awareness. Was it a shameless cash grab? Absolutely. Could they have used less slow-motion and hokey effects in general? You bet. Did moments feel awkward and tonally dissonant? 100%. Did I still have fun watching it? Mostly?People forget that these movies were dopey enough to begin with, by virtue of being 90's sci-fi. The premise of the story is built on flawed principles (ie human batteries--the OG idea for the brain's processing power creating a neural network that sustains The Matrix is way better). The fourth movie makes those flawed principles less flawed in context, but not without bringing its own flaws into the mix (ie human batteries that produce a consciousness-based/emotional field of unknown energy which is used to power the Matrix is solid but conflicts with The Second Renaissance and other worldbuilding).Thus the Matrix: Resolutions is a mixed bag. Hardcore fans will treat it like Star Wars fans treat the newest trilogy, while people just wanting to have a good time will probably have a good time. Its a popcorn flick for popcorn movie night. It's not great. Make of that what you will.",6
3924,"Unlike the massacre that's going on here I think it's a good movie. Not great, not bad, but good. There is even something to be said about its interesting approach to trauma, denial, psychosis and delusion. Worth a watch.",7
3925,"When the so called expert movie critics have panned a movie and made up their mind for you, they have damaged the reputation of the movie to a point where you won't feel like going to the theatre to watch the film! This is exactly what has been done to Resurrections and frankly I am disappointed to have not seen this on a big screen because of bad reviews by what seem to be uptight critics and bot reviewers. While the movie heavily borrows upon the first 3 films it does so for the sake of continuity and there is nothing quite as new in the action sequences as well but what does separate this film from the rest is the story and the bold new direction it takes. Now which of these bot reviewers here mention bad script writing? It's actually quite good and has some complex sub plots brought in for good measure and I am an IT engineer and I definitely understood the techie bits pretty well and it is actually a fact that the 'Analyst' controls pretty much the direction a project is going and in this case the project is 'The Matrix'. Ignore the haters and watch this film, but remember this film does not try to outdo the franchise but it does give a better conclusion to the shocker ending of the trilogy. Highly recommended.",8
3926,It's sad that they brought The Matrix down to this level.The first movie was revolutionary in techniques and ideas.This one is an obvious money grabber. The storytelling is not even coherent.Very sad.,
3927,"A disappointing mess that adds not value or improved context to the story, it recycles the old themes and misses out on the opportunity to use filmography in the same way the original was famous for. Neo being able to stop bullets was a natural skill that he could do with little effort, yet in this he has to wave his hands around to create a force field type effect.Total nonsense and a disappointing wait for such a great concept.I will definitely not watch the follow up.",3
3928,"Yes, stay away!Poor directed, first 30min until you try to figure out the plot is the max of the interest you get... After that is bland, unpleasant, boring, and if you didn't have Keanu Reaves and Carrie-Anne Moss, you would think it was a low-budget film...I was waiting for a different storyline, a continuation of the first trilogy, and the same line of the trilogy... from the storyline to the acting, even to the combat scenes. Guess what. It is nothing like in the trilogy... it is just a money grabber.The directors did the impossible:After the first movie, the next got a lower rating, being this last one the worst of all!Stay away from this movie.",2

Lana could not have reached higher with her carefully placed icons and symbolism, keeping with the original ideal yet still addressing our society's continuous drift into a more nuanced existence.

3930,"Another very late, unneeded sequel from Hollywood. Decent action scenes and visuals can't save this movie from the boring dialogue that's littered with cringe 2021 jokes and random woke references. Hard to care about any characters. Actors probably did the best with what they were given but even some of Keanu's and Carrie's lines just seemed lifeless to me. Not the worst movie though. 5/10.",5
3931,"Ï for one is really happy with the movie and I really hope that they will make more movies to follow up on this one.I loved how the film captured the struggles from everyday society and how people today don't feel like they belong and the only way we can ever fit in is to take a lot of blue pills and put our lives on auto pilot.Sure, the plot was a litte bit to complicated at times and some scenes felt like old news but the overall experience was still very enjoyable.",10
3932,This movie is only mildly entertaining if you're interested in seeing how truly lame this cash grab of a movie is.Poor set design. The movie looks like it was filmed on a 1940s movie lot. Not a lot effort made into the props and scenery. Especially in the urban settings. The urban areas do not feel gritty. Too clean. Comes of as unnatural. And that does not enhance or drive the story. The set design actually disappoints.The story I could not grasp. All i know it did not have the power of the first movie. The first movie felt like a veil of deceit was being lifted from my eyes. This movie has no message other than to twist its over arching narrative askew.Acting was dull. Like watching tree bark grow. Wooden delivery. Lame lines. Too bad they changed out morpheus for another actor. I could not buy in. No matter how they tried to spin it.The action was okay. But not important. You never feel under duress. You always know the good guys are going to win. Also the agents are dumbed down and nerfed. You can't even tell the agents from there disguised form apart.Overall this movie feels like a cash grab just trying to capitalize off the original's magic. But there's no substance at all here.,6
3933,"No Matrix sequels were as good the the original. This one is no exception.While this was a bit long, I think it will get better if you can watch it a couple more times later - there were just too much information. I thought the previous two sequels were not very good, but I have since changed my mind. They were still no as good but not as bad as some people claimed.",6
3934,"Whilst this lacks many things, it's still better written than the third movie and just lacked the budget. I hope the studio green lights a sequel and gives them the special effects team this movie needed. It mostly lacked cinema style cinematography and the soundscape was teensy.But I still want to see the story continue.",6
3935,This movie had promise in the first act. I enjoyed it. But the third act was terrible. It went against everything in the trilogy and what the trilogy actually taught. Disappointing.,6

Sometimes a clown, sometimes Morpheus alike.Too much noticeable vfx on character movement. It's just distracting and doesn't convey nothing. And green screens are reallly noticeable.

If not, then you grew up in the Matrix.and therefore anything is possible.Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss are really the big draws on this rebootand neither disappoint, because you do want them to be together again.Consider Mr Reeves was filming Matrix 4 / Wick 4 movie back to back, and all is forgiven....",8
3939,"A lot can be said but I have only one question! Why did you make this movie without having a solid history, a some ok concept at last ???? This movie is a disaster, a mess! The whole matrix philosophy is gone, nothing of it... Thank you for almost nothing in 2,25 minutes!!! Sooo wasted......",2
3940,"There is a part in the movie where they talk about what to put in the next matrix game to make it sell. That pretty much sum up the film.Lots of nostalgia and ""bullet time"".All the characters are rushed, and you honestly don't care who lives and dies, making all the tries at dramatic final stands fall flat. Watching this film was for me a waste of time.",2
3941,"This is NOT better than the original, let's just get that out of the way, BUT Resurrections is the best sequel because of it's confident telling of ideas and philosophies that made The Matrix intriguingly perplexed. Now, while the film has some issues with its aging actors, Neo and Trinity still have enough chemistry to spark emotions and kick ass in the process. Is this a great film? Hmm, no. But would you watch the next sequel if they made it? Probably yes. That's Hollywood.",8
3942,"They should've stopped after the first one, the third one was already a stretch.A lot of bla bla philosophical junk, combined with a lot of retro clips.",4
3943,"Anyone saying this is ""good"" can only be doing it to support wokeness and Lana Wochowski and they are doing a disservice to the film industry. I literally stopped watching this half way through and I'm glad I did. It has cheapened the entire Matrix franchise for me.The first Matrix was one of my favourite movies of all time, but this steaming pile wouldn't even make the top 500.Obviously we can see who the talent was behind the Matrix, and Lana was not it. She utterly destroyed a good franchise with this meta dumpster fire loaded with trans allegory.I feel bad for Keanu Reeves being dragged into this. What an embarrassment for that poor guy.",1
3944,"In the trend of cash-grabbing sequels and remakes, the latest Matrix movie gives the expected level of disappointment. The pacing lost you from the start and the execution gave it a feeling of not really caring anymore.There was one thing I didn't expect through, and that was the commentary on today's cultural landscape that felt almost cathartic to watch -- sometimes delivered directly by the characters. Thank you Lana Wachowski for sharing your vitriolic thoughts with us, you gave me hope that there's a way we can dig ourselves out of this hell we've created from modern Internet over usage.If you can stream the movie for free, do so, but it's not worth the price of a movie ticket.",7
3945,"Matrix IV brings the series to a new level, for those we were really into the ideology. A well-done continuation for a matured story, not easy.Morpheus is the unconditional faith that always leads the path of awakening. Trinity is the indestructible pursue for / relationship with the real.""My name is Trinity.""",9
3946,"This movie won't change your life like the original Matrix, nor will it leave you scratching your head like Revolutions. It will, however, leave you wanting more like Reloaded.All of the ideas are done really well, with some events that I didn't expect like the machines working with the humans being a great surprise. The nostalgia doesn't overstay its welcome nor does it feel cheesy or cringy.Neil Patrick Harris' role as 'The Analyst' (and, by extension, the new Architect) was done perfectly. His personality gives unique weight and depth to the character, and surprised me with his humor mixed with the Architect's familiar cynicism.The movie isn't perfect by any means, as the pacing can fumble at times, sometimes feeling a little rushed. Aside from that issue, it is a wonderful film featuring commentary on the state of Hollywood, and its 'resurrecting' of long-gone franchises, as well as a new, fresh look at The Matrix and its possible future.",8
3947,"I really wanted this to be a successful movie especially considering all these sequels of legends (Craig's last Bond/Disney Star Wars etc.) have failed miserably. Unfortunately, my hopes were crushed after watching the Resurrections.I am not an ultra Matrix universe fan but, enjoyed immensely the first one and found the second two quite attractive. 1999 Matrix has surely been one of the greatest 90's movies and do not deserve the here proposed conclusion.To be fair, I must admit that the beginning of the movie was neatly done and had me somewhat intrigued leaving some room for curiosity and imagination. After the 'prologue' though it became a total mess with fairy-tale scripting and questionable acting - particularly from Keanu Reeves.He remains one of my favorite actors and an ICON but, here it seems as if he just slept through the whole movie. No sure what was the reason for that. Carrie Ann Moss was good and best performance mention surprisingly goes to Neil Patrick Harris.Fight Scenes though quite dynamic were BAD, mainly due to constant extensive camera movement which had the viewer confused and baffled trying to grasp what is going on.Action scenes (shooting) were even worse - it is the matrix but, seems human characters were bulletproof from start till the end.And finally, the story in total lacked credibility and bluntly put is just not smart. The hidden meaning of gender fluidity and the 'real' vs 'artificial' implied in movie feels forced and wrongly placed.Not too many positives but to name a few: beginning, Bugs somewhat a likeable character, not as much 'Political Correctness' applied as in today's productions/sequels , NPH performance, Nostalgia - flashbacks to original matrix.Sad part is that yet again a recent-times sequel has destroyed the premises of an Iconic art so cleverly crafted two decades ago.FILM used to be culture - it isn't anymore, mainly thanks to all these streaming services. No one seems to care anymore and is satisfied for mass mediocrity. It just strives to be shallow-minded couch entertainment and not a very good one.With a broken heart I must admit the Matrix Resurrections though started very nicely, has fallen into THAT rabbit hole.",4
3948,"I appreciated what they they were attempting to accomplish in reintroducing the franchise. They show flashbacks to any references they make, I do wish that I had rewatched the entire trilogy before watching this though, bc I totally blanked out on what had happened.It was no original, but people have bashed it so much, so I was expecting mediocre, but it wasn't. And honestly, the way tv shows and movies tend to be these days, it was refreshing not to have an opinion shoved down my throat. It was just a fun movie based on a franchise we all loved when it entered our lives. Enjoy it for what it is.And hats off to the very well aged Reeves &amp; Moss.",7
3949,Felt very Mumbo Jumbo and poorly thought out and rushed and felt like we got nowhere in the story and felt just like everything was based on nostalgia and had no balance it was either full focus on newer aspects or full focus on nostalgia.The actors I believe were phenomenal and cgi was on point but so was transformers but it was cool to see Smith and Neo fight however.,4
3950,"Ignore most of the reviews here, I'm assuming they were written by people who blindly enjoy every marvel film with their copy and paste endings and nothing more to realistically offer than obscenely good looking characters and bright colours. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy(ed) a good marvel film up to and including endgame, but they're hardly groundbreaking. In fact they're choking the life out of cinema, with very few standalone 'blockbusters' garnering anywhere near as much blind and universal praise and box office receipts. I'd place money that all these reviewers putting a downer on this film were the same blind people who expected/wanted more of the same, didn't get it and were upset by how 'meta' it was whilst cheering at recent 'meta' involvement in the new Spiderman film. Both a playing on past histories, but one is a shameless cash grab of an idea, playing on a nostalgia that doesn't really exist because those characters were once deemed surplus to requirements, hence why Uncle Ben has died about as many times as there have been Matrix films in the same amount of time. The other is a lovingly crafted story of love and second chances, made by the original creators before the studio did it without them and we all now that's not a film we want to see. Yes, it's a fourthquel in multi-billion dollar franchise, but the story is so on point for the current state of media that it's impossible to ignore. Casual viewers will moan there's no epic bullet time moments or the fighting isn't as clever etc etc but they'd be missing the whole point. This story is more reflective of our world than ever, with the matrix now looking like a beautiful sun missed San Francisco and the real world looking just too shiny, lending credence to the question of what's real and the fact Neo himself is reluctant to leave takes aim at how with all the 'social media' and media outlets at our disposal it's just harder to believe anything extraordinary can and does happen. The will to 'believe' has waned. But not as the credits role, I left revitalised and reinvigorated by a film that dared to be different and got it mostly right, looking at you The Last Jedi, it's clever, stunning in parts and looks as usual exquisite. New characters are instantly memorable and slip right in beside the familiar faces. The Matrix Reloaded this isn't, but then was that what we really wanted. Unlike retreading old ground with new reboots and sequels desecrating their own mythologies this a very personal and knowing trip down memory lane. That's why Resurrection gives me hope, Lana Wachowski has just about crafted a franchise blockbuster sequel that dares to prove there's a future that these mainstream movies can make us rethink what's possible and believe, inspiring rather than following blindly. The only question remains, are you ready to believe?",9
3951,"I've watched it twice now, and I watched the original trilogy between viewings. They did a remarkable job connecting to the story while telling a completely new one. It's not a perfect film in its execution, but it is a near perfect film in what it achieves with its story. I went in expecting a reboot; and instead got an entirely new story that manages to fulfill all the original constraints of the Matrix universe while adding a lot of new things to think about.I guess what I'm trying to say is that the only thing that would have disappointed me is if the movie had failed to change the way I think about reality.",9
3952,"Those saying it was boring and dragging obviously do not appreciate the characters individually and the story as a whole. The nostalgia was necessary. This was just the beginning/ opener if you will, for a new era of matrix. The action was there, the fighting scenes were awesome. But matrix is not just about action and fighting. It's a story about saving humanity, it's a love story. Trinity and Neo are back together now stronger than ever. Master piece in my opinion.",10
3953,I went into this movie with much fear that it would be the same uninspired and creatively bankrupt schlock that Hollywood is known for nowadays. I was right about most of my assumptions.The film is a haphazard jump between one nostalgia trip to the next. It fails to explain why or give a clear idea of what is happening. Are they really just shoveling the same two-decade old scenes into our mouths for the billionth time and claiming it as a new movie? I almost puked after the third white rabbit reference.The only reason this movie got 4 stars was because of Keanu carrying this trainwreck of a script and the visuals department delivering a stellar visual experience.,4
3954,"As the heading goes.. this movie is only for those who are willing to put some effort to comprehend what they see. Others.. who see The Matrix for its flashy costumes or the action..well for those there is a sleuth of movies belonging to the genre which included Pacific Rim or The Transformers or even the good old Shaolin Soccer. To such viewers I just have one thing to say.. when you come to eat the sandwich biscuits with cream.. you can lick of the cream sure.. but a tad more effort is needed to eat the biscuits. If you just wanted the cream and weren't willing to put the effort to eat the biscuit.. well why not settle for a custard. The Matrix Resurrections is a an excellent wholesome meal and movie making at its best. So please.. it does deserve some effort if it is to entertain you because the effort that you the viewer puts in .. is part of the effort. All this is to all those viewers who were quick to judge the movie for its reduced action sequences and redundant displays of scenes from its prequels.. Please people.. think again. Or at the very least please have the decency to tone down your criticisms.. it's been quite a tragedy to see such a marvel of a movie being trashed simply because it doesn't fit into the general convention of a Sci-Fi or a thriller or an action movie.. honestly.. this is the Wachowskis who gave you The Matrix (1999) the Reloaded and Revolutions. And of course.. the series Sense8. Of course these are all creations which require you to ruminate and ponder upon and not just another watch and entertain package.Now to the audience who are willing to put the effort.. people this is a movie which will not let you down. Certainly it would make you want to go back to it again because it's a lot of thinking concentrated to 150 minutes and it certainly does put up a spurt of speed halfway through without warning.. just when one would think that the movie was beginning to seem like fan fiction. As a person in whom The concept of the Matrix has evoked introspection.. I must say.. this is such a great gift of a movie. Because it answers as to how he humans progressed after the Machine War ends in The Matrix Revolutions. Zion was portrayed as the abode of humans ... the literal haven of the 'good' humans while the Earth's crust had been 'snatched' away by the villainous machine intelligence. But then the same Matrix also had Oracle and Sati which conveyed that true intelligence comprehends the fallacy that is dichotomous beliefs or morales. Simply put, the foolishness of trying to fit what is created into the framework of good and bad. It's cooperation and balance which sustains while anything else would look utopic in short sight but certainly would not be sustainable.So yes.. how did the humans fare after the war and how did the machines fare.. this forms the premise of the movie. And certainly a gem has been created once again. The Matrix (1999) presented the idea while reloaded and revolutions took it forward. To one who paid attention it would be clear that.. as the sequels progressed.. it was more and more of insights into the mind of humans and machines and clearly underneath the difference there was a lot of common ground for both since both minds are seats of true intelligence. The idea of individuality, of disobedience, of being the misshapen peg in the geometric hole.. is personified in all the humans who woke up out of the matrix and also in Smith.. the agent.In short.. this is moviemaking and storytelling at its best. So really to those of you who are willing to pay attention and aren't fond of only mindless pleasure.. this is a movie for You. It is certainly not for everybody. It would be great if this was realised by the general audience.. when it is being unduly harsh on a masterpiece which certainly deserves a much much better reception.",10
3955,"Perfect example of capitalizing on a name and all its glory. My opinion is purely biased on due to the fact I thoroughly enjoyed the original matrix movie, not because of the action sequences (which were awesome) but the depth of story. This movie, for the first half of the movie, plays off of elements and flash backs from the first movie trying hard to play on your nostalgic heartstrings. It uses pretty much all of the original work with a brand new shiny remake twist... this movie actually calls itself out and blatantly mocks itself knowing full well that it is profiting on an original idea and work of art. It is certainly entertaining, and visually pleasing.. I personally would have enjoyed an advancing evolution of story and plot point to tidy up the inconsistencies. Phenomenal concept, yet I feel that they forced the story forward using material from the first movie as an attention grabbing diversion purposely distracting from the lack of originality story telling. Certainly, finding parallels to the very first movie is hard to overlook. This movie would have been so much better had it taken on a life of its own, and didn't rely so heavily piggy backing on the original concept. Not to mention, I personally found it difficult to look at certain characters that were played by original cast members being recasted and played by actors that weren't even born before the original matrix was made. This movie had such great potential, using everyday source material to use as an engine to propel an easy plot point to drive home the message of virtual reality/ social media vs actual reality... yet as I perceive it, it's using the concept of love conquers all. So in summery, this movie uses the original material and concepts via story and flash back sequences, it doesn't have ALL the original cast members (which is hard to ignore), and the underlying message does not coincide with the entirety of the original trilogy..... yes, the original matrix used love as a factor, but it was always determined that the story was man vs machine (technology).",6
3956,"One of the main components of Matrix are awesome mind-bending action scenes. Resurrection doesn't have it at all. In some cases (Smith-Neo fight), it's some weird parody of action where a bunch of people jump from different angles at each other, bunch up, and wave their hands like mad people which weirdly server as a background to w/e else is happening.I mean, pretty much all action scenes are the same things: a confusing bunch of people waving their hands, and shouting. It's just bad.Story wise, it wasn't that bad. It's a decent answer for anyone who asks, ""what if...?"".All in all, a mixed bag of decent story, few good ideas, pretty effects, and a lot of bad action.",5
3957,"Better late than never vs Took them long enough... I'll go with the former. This rebirth has all the intensity of the earlier installments. It ties in perfectly with the ending of Matrix 3. If you liked the originals, don't miss this one- ignore the criticisms and enjoy the return of the best sci-fi action franchise ever.",10
3958,"The Matrix was one of the most original films ever made, imitated so much that anyone watching it for the first time now would find it unoriginal. The sequel was disappointing in that it didn't build on that first one or Neo's promise to reveal the truth to the world instead descending into psycho babble. The less said about the third film the better. So I went to see this more in hope that expectation and was pleasantly surprised. No, it doesn't have the originality of the first film, and it does linger too much on the 'Greatest Hits'. But it does deliver a coherent script that makes sense, and I'm sure some of the one liners are a dig at the studios for wanting another sequel. Most films that bring someone back from the dead stretch credulity but not here, as does the change of appearance for Morpheus, it is credible in the sense of the first movie, and they have moved on with some of the technology as you would expect.The Original movie was so innovative that it would be impossible to match that wow factor again in a sequel, and this doesn't try to. It tells a story, albeit a simple tale told in numerous different ways but it is worth a couple of hours on the big screen. I would still like to see a Matrix sequel that does 'reveal the truth' to the enslaved humans. This hints at it briefly, too briefly, to explain the motives of a couple of the new characters. The end of this leaves scope for a further film but if it does it needs to be something more. We only ever buy one Greatest Hits album and this is it.",6
3959,"The movie Matrix Ressureição was indeed a long-awaited comeback by fans.The franchise this time showed a change in philosophy that may not appeal to all fans.In fact, the movie isn't perfect, but it's certainly a story we could expect, as are the second and third movies in the franchise.If in doubt, better check it out. I particularly liked the movie.",8
3960,"This movie has zero impact on the trilogy story. It is something that no one really ever asked for (for the very obvious somewhat disappointing 3rd part) and after watching this, I don't think anyone really needed this either.*Spoilers Below*To sum it up, ""The Analysist"" realized for whatever reason first Neo and then Trinity both MUST stay connected to The Matrix for it to function properly or it will destabilize and won't work. He decided to resurrect them both when he finds out keeping only Neo connected was not enough and they needed Trinity as well. But they also needed to be kept apart enough without them ever being a couple or it will destabilize The Matrix. (Confused? It doesn't get any better!)Neo on the other hand, had a hard-on for Trinity and decided to save her and remind her who she really was. At the end they both got together but it didn't look like The Matrix had any stability issues at all since they both were ""freed"" out of The Matrix at the end and it was still working fine. Oh and now Trinity can fly too, so yay!",7
3961,"This movie Editing, StoryWriting, Camera work required adult supervision. It seems like a kids school project.The writer of the movie had ADHD and failed to keep audience perspective in mind.This movie also had poor camera work as if taken from a 1990 handy-cam, ultra low budget TV series do better than this in terms of camera/frame motion quality.The Action sequences where haphazard.The sets were also not thought through, the coffee shop scene where action happens had too many cops for them to be effective.The characters lacked any depth the architect of matrix was being thrown around as if he has no power, how can that be.How can they mess up this badly I am amazed.This is truly a case of someone telling Lana Wachowski to seek the write advise and get better people on her team. Especially who can give her critical feedback.",2
3962,After watching this movie I am extremely satisfied with it . I don't think people are giving enough credit and thought into the difficulty of making this sequel to the Matrix trilogy . I loved the concept that they have taken with the plot. The references to the previous trilogy movies really helped to connect this film to the rest of the story. What a great way of saying it was all a just a video game .Additionally people who are saying it was boring are not appreciating the exposition being given to explain what has happened in the big time jump between the last movie and to explain all the questions this movie has created from the beginning .The cinematographer and cgi is great with high intensity soundtrack that further adds to the suspens and stakes within this film.Although it's not a 10 out of 10 movie it is most definitely not a 3 or 4 star film .I would say it's a solid 7.5 and star film that provides some great original ideas that separates itself from the other films in the series . For any Matrix fan you should find this film extremely satisfying to watch and it's just great seeing Neo again . DONT listen to the haters .,10
3963,"The trilogy was good. The first movie however was legendary. This one on the other hand... was completely a waste of time to be honest. I never tought they could grab a legendary movie and literally destroy the memory of it with a movie so bad like this one. If u haven't watched matrix resurrections, please do urself a favour and just dont or you gonna be like the bots after watching it...",1
3964,"I'll start this review by saying the original Matrix is one of my favourite movies of all time and I'm very much the target market for this new instalment.It's largely a disappointment. They spend the first hour going over old ground, setting a very quirky back story and repeating a ridiculous amount from the original(s). It's not until this part of the movie is set that they start moving forward with the new story. Unfortunately, that's very much aligned closer to the 3rd movie than either the first or the second.As the plot developed I had theory that the entire movie is a metaphor for Lana Wachowski's transition (or possibly her entire life). Then towards the end of the movie some grade A virtue signalling confirmed this to be true. Note to IMDB: This is not my opinion of any 'real life' matter, but what I believe to to have been the rationale for the movie's plot.Therefore like so many sequels, it re-writes a lot of what made the original such a great movie.I've had to think hard to consider what could be positives about the movie. With the exception of Keanu doing his usual slow talking as Neo, the acting is pretty good and there's some good new characters. Keanu and Carrie-Anne do a great job of bringing the exact same personalities to the characters. Neil Patrick Harris is particularly good. Jonathan Groff is good as Agent Smith but the way they've written the character really lacks purpose.Having said all of that, I still enjoyed watching the movie despite is being hugely disappointing. That's why I've still given it a 5. I do expect the vast majority of fans to give it lower than this. As for any new fans, you'll be completely lost. I'd advise anyone watching it to ensure you're familiar with the first 3 movies.They really should have left the original trilogy well alone.",5
3965,"The original concept was complicated and ground breaking, but this reboot has actually accomplished what I did not think possible - it has astonished me to new levels of awesomeness. The symbolism of the original trilogy was what carried the whole story, but this one has managed to still hold that symbolism and bring it to a new concept. You will need to bring your brain to watch this one though; in fact, if you are a Marvel and superhero fan, then do not even bother because you will not understand this movie at all. For the rest of you, go and watch it with an open mind, and you will see what this movie is trying to tell you. Awesome.",9
3966,"I have to give 1 star Because there is no 0 star for me to choose.Movie is badly written, not a single moment i care about any character, i actually wish them to die from time to time to build up some motion, and remember this is R rate movie and the plot is like ben 10 cartoon movie.",1
3967,That's all I have to ask: Why? This was an aggressively mediocre movie that did not progress much of anything or leave much of an impression on me. Movie studios throwing in the actual solid original movies into a blender and releasing whatever edit comes from that into theatres would be less of a slap to the face than this 10th attempt of recapturing/mimicking superior classics.,6
3968,"Watch the first movie, then take the blue pill and forget the rest. This film is pretty bad, the action, plot, acting, writing, cinematography, how could it all go so wrong. The pacing is woeful, no tension at all. Feels like your standard made for Netflix movie, totally forgettable.... I hope.",5
3969,"I went into this movie expecting to hate it, but I ended up having fun. Do not expect anything crazy from this film but for a reboot it does a good job of linking the previous movies into the story and great special effects. Overall a fun movie for what it is, I plan on watching it again on HBO Max.",8
3970,"People don't seem to get the point of the sequel, the changed tone, and the different aesthetic... It's sad, really, how ""fans"" who think they get the first three movies now fail to understand this one too...For those that aren't completely close-minded - give it a look, it's pretty great. Rewatch the originals first too, for a nice refresher.",6
3971,"The movie started ok, then it become mehh, then it was a Tarantino movie for one song and suddenly it was the best Michael Bay movie i have ever seen.I must admit i have never laughed so hard at a movie like this before.I had no expectations and was still disappointed.",3
3972,"I created an account just to write this because I needed to vent. I gave this two stars just because I like Keanu Reeves and I feel bad that they destroyed a character he personifies so well.Let's be clear, the Matrix Resurrections is and enigma but not in a good way. The entire movie feels rushed but drags on. High dollar budget but looks cheaply made. Boring action. Lots of dialog but nothing is really said. Overly complicated story that is uninteresting.I loved the trilogy and I'm going to take a blue pill as soon as I'm done and go back to the Matrix where Neo dies as a hero.",2
3973,"When i heard months ago , that there will be a fourth matrix, i was very excited, because i thought that there will be a propper ending to the story... it seems that the final result, its not what i was hoping to see....i watched some cutscenes , i read some reviews and i decided not to bother...i have seen the first 3 movies, they were amazing, but they had to stop it there or to give a better ending to the series..i may be wrong, but i feel i am right...i am now waiting for the next john wick that i hope to be legendary.",5
3974,"Copy and paste. That's all they did then added annoying characters while the originals tried to keep it afloat. By playing the majority of the original movie in splice you'd think they'd keep the feel of it too because they can obviously see it, but instead it looks like it came from the Hallmark channel. Good thing it was free on HBO Max otherwise I would have given it a 1-star. Pure garbage.",2
3975,"A purely emotional sequel, the story adds some simple modern ideas to the past and retells it again. In the dialogue, there were many screenwriters who laughed at Warner's behavior of dog-tailed ermine, coupled with Keanu's exhausted performance, eager to use the past plot to evoke a touch of fans, but that's it. Smith without Uncle Hugo, no matter how he flashed back, the smell would disappear.",5
3976,"Paying for a ticket was a waste of money. To even think i helped to finance this movie makes me guilty.There is no originality in this movie, feels like a yesterday meal prepared to look different by the same chef.",3
3977,"Biggest disappointment since the last jedi , I can't describe just how awful it was , from the fights to even the music it lacked any integrity of the originals. Best it was the intro ...",3
3978,"I am a huge fan of the matrix series and animae and this movie was a great natural evolution in the matrix universe with its fresh ideas and interesting story lines, however the action and fight scenes were a huge let down.I don't understand Neo, with all his power and abilities to manipulate the matrix still resorts to 11th century kungfu and so to does his adversaries.We have been spoilt with big blockbusters recently taking advantage of today's technology blended with creative choreography but this movie fails to deliver any sort of excitement or visual impact when it comes to the ""action"" scenes with alot of the moves and fight sequence straight out copied from the originals only a bit more slower.Good try but somethings do not improve with age.",6
3979,"I will not tell you what you will read in other reviews, whether if they are good or bad, but I will give you some answers, and the reason why this movie deserves 9 stars, why not more, and why not less.Ok, Neo and Trinity are old and tired now, but did you watch the entire movie till the end? They both became even more powerful than ever, at the end of the movie. And remember, this is set 60 years after the dead of Trinity and the ceasefire/peace treaty. This movie is the future of Matrix.Now, I don't know what the producers are planning to do, currently, no official plans for a Matrix Resurrections sequel have been announced. Warner CEO Ann Sarnoff hinted that Warner Bros. Would be open to a Matrix 5, if director Lana Wachowski wanted to make it. So, there are big chances this is a new trilogy. But think about it, if there will be a new trilogy, this is how this should have started, because imagine a Matrix movie without Neo and Trinity, I probably wouldn't even watch it, honestly. They are the most loved characters, other than Morpheus.And talking about Morpheus... a lot of people complained that Laurence Fishburne was not in this movie, and some even hate the new Morpheus. But take in mind, again, that this is set 60-year after the ceasefire/peace treaty. The real/original/human Morpheus is dead! So, this is a new reconstructed Morpheus by Neo, inside The Matrix. And this takes us back to the first comment, ""Oh Neo and Trinity look old and tired""; However, the same people who complain about this, also complain about the new young and strong Morpheus. There's no way to have them happy, because they are just haters!I would be happy if Morpheus was still alive, like a Zion or IO governor or senator or something like that, but it wouldn't make sense make a sequel in that timeline because remember, Zion and the machines had a peace treaty. So, that peace treaty should last at least 60 years. That makes sense!It all makes sense!Now, let me give you my honest opinion about this movie. ""The Matrix Resurrections"" is nearly as great as the first Matrix movie, and better than ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" don't listen to the haters! The first movie is still my favorite, and this happens very often in many sequels because usually the first one is the one with the big story, all others are just the follow-up to a great story because the first one was so successful. But ""The Matrix Resurrections"" is still a great movie because of many reasons, and I don't think I have time to explain all of them, but if you want to understand why it is a great movie, please don't make the mistake that most people do, please, please, take a marathon, and watch the first three movies again (no matter how many times you watched them a long time ago), but watch them first before watching this one.I give 9 stars. And I will explain why 9, why not 10, and why not less than 9.Now, the story could have been better? I believe yes. The production could have been better? I also believe yes. For example, Neo shouldn't look like John Wick, honestly. This new appearance made me think a lot about John Wick, while watching the movie and that was very distracting, honestly. I understand he is the same actor, but why should he look exactly like John Wick?Another thing is, if there were going to reconstruct Trinity, and thank you so much for that, I love Trinity, and I was so sad in the last movie, but at least give me better reasons to believe they were able to reconstruct her and bring her back to life. I mean, she was totally dead! Did you see how she died in that last movie? How is it even possible? But I understand, technology improved, and probably her brain was still alive, so they were able to reconstruct her. But I feel like there's still something missing in this story. I mean, how is this even possible? Maybe, we needed some more science in this part of the story, so we are not like ""really?"". But again, I am super happy that she is back. Thank you so much for that.Everything is possible in Hollywood. Now I can believe that Tony Stark can be resurrected.You made me think that everything possible in Hollywood, even resurrecting Tony Stark (which has nothing to do with Matrix, but I have to say it). But again, thank you for resurrecting Trinity, even if I feel like a child when his parents are lying to him, but what a happy lie. At least I am so happy with this lie.Now, do we need to talk about everything else? (The acting performance, cinematography, editing, sound mix, etc. Etc. Etc.) I don't think so because I think they were all great, and that's why I give it 9 stars. Except for the new agent Smith, but I will no go in details with this, you all should know what I'm talking about.Special effects and cinematography were even better than what I was expecting because it seems like hollywood movie producers have been trying to save some money lately due to the pandemic, and that's sad but Warner Bros. Gave me more than what I expected and thank you very much for that.The last 30 minutes of the movie were beyond thrilling. I opened my eyes wider and was so thrilled that I was like ""Wow! You made it! Now we have a great movie in 2021!It's a great movie, period.If you are a Matrix fan, you will love it. I don't think a Matrix fan will actually hate this movie. But there are always some haters everywhere. Don't listen to them because they hate everything in life, everything.Please don't pay attention to unsubstantiated reviews. It's a great movie.",9
3980,"If you have fond memories of the Matrix and it's lore, I would skip this movie entirely so you don't poison them. The issue with many modern remakes is that they forget the most important part of a film which is a good story. This has none of that and is a shell of what the Matrix was. A cheap and utterly forgettable film. However, if you were a fan of the first one like I was, it is genuinely irritating that they took the legacy and totally changed into a parody for some reason. As a standalone, it's even worse because they kept rehashing themes and ideals from the previous ones while undermining them at the same time. Terrible writing..",2
3981,"Thank god I'm just a viewer and not a critic... They will have a really bad time with this.If you are reading this review, please do not let the following points deter you from watching the movie... but I would advise to watch it as an online stream.If you are someone who participated in making this movie; please do not be offended, I'm just putting down what I saw and felt.As a viewer, I will try to be methodological with this review:1- The Storyline: it is a mess, incoherent and out of sync... I guess the writer/s had a really bad time figuring out how they will bring their characters back to life, so this has to be the result of at least 3 iterations that conflicted and some residue was left behind from the other losing ones.2- The Script: So artificial and has so many gaps that could only confuse new viewers that are not really familiar with the Matrix... I know I was confused, and I know the Matrix by heart.3- The direction and cut: I really hope there is another director's cut that drops the stupid flashbacks that did not add or enrich this piece... it should be used wisely and when it actually means something.4- The Action scenes: I really believe this should also fall under the director's fault... it was somehow slow and in most moments you can see the shortcomings of actors that are acting fight scenes.5- Customs, makeup and art direction: I have no complaints here, I think they did a decent job.6- FX: Well, nothing here you did not see in any other Sci-fi movie from 5 years ago and to this date... I do not believe they deserve to even be nominated for special effects.7- Music and score: I guess the people responsible for the score was as confused as we are... or maybe it was handled as general moments (amazement, introduction, recall, epic..etc) nothing stands out and it surly did not give you the chills and enriched the general experience.8- Cast: I really do not want to go there; but it would suffice to say that casting should have fought harder.9- Cinematography and edit: That was a total failure, and the edits did not even try to match the smallest things that gave the original Matrix its special flare like color grading.General: this movie was not made with passion at all... you can see, feel and sense it in every corner... but you have to respect the work done because there is a lot of effort, but not an effective one.",3
3982,"It's a great movie in the truest sense of the word. You have to understand it in order to love it for those who criticize the movie, I don't blame them for not understanding anything. It is complex and deep. I would advise those who critics to watch it again and they will know what I am talking about. I loved it, it is no better than the original but it is a very good beautiful love story that is an excellent creative direction. In short, a movie worth watching once, twice, and three times.",10
3983,"To begin, people are only dumping on this movie for these reasons:Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving didn't return.They are transphobic.It wasn't exactly what they individually wanted and how they individually wanted it so apparently it deserves to be destroyed online - truly a pathetic trend.I don't believe this movie deserves a ten, but it certainly doesn't deserve anything less than a seven. It's fun, in the same style of the previous movies, and brought our beloved characters back in a great way. Before Neo ""died,"" he could basically do anything in the Matrix - it makes sense that he can do that again in this one, and even that his power inside grows to the point smashing cars and deflecting rockets.Neil Patrick Harris, as always, does a fantastic job as the Analyst...I did not like the actor who played Smith nor understand why he was brought back at all without Weaving aside from a plot device I won't spoil. The only reason I can think of is setting up further sequels.All in all, it has a bit of a different feel than the original trilogy, and it contained new technology that was developed over the 60+ years since the original timeline - did you really expect it would stay stagnant? Did you really think humanity would survive a war with the machines without some sort of coexistence - that the peace at the end of the original trilogy would last forever?If you went in expecting a clone of the original, you were just not being realistic. You do understand that there's still conflict between the machines and humans right? It also confronts free will, ethics, and morality in that some folks don't want to be freed and others are kept against their will to power the machines. This movie contained everything I wanted it to anyway. Y'all can keep hating, doesn't change that this is a gem.",10
3984,"Full (like tons) of contradictions.Such as (Jude) one of the programs that should be with neo all the time to make sure he is far from Trin(Tiff), he took his hand and drag him to introduce him to her in the coffeeshop.... this is one example of ton of contradictions.In other word they(directors&amp; producers) just ruin the old legend (the Matrix Trio) with this sh....",
3985,It adds to the matrix universe nicely and the reasons for why things are as they are (why they are back in the matrix and the new Morpheus) really made sense to me and I thought it was very clever.The action is not at the same level as the trilogy but it was entertaining. They could have turned down the nostalgia a notch and some of the humor didn't quite land for me.All in all a good addition to the Matrix franchise. It felt nostalgic but surprisingly original.,8
3986,"Matrix had been one of the most acclaimed sequel till part-3. Viewer expectations were too high.Great graphics, amateur story writing, low budget by removing main actors, great graphics, half-hearted and unsure editing / producing skills, sums up matrix - 4. I hope there will be a matrix - 5 bridging gap with original trilogy.",
3987,"I was so hyped for this and I really wanted this movie to be as epic as the first one but instead it turned out to be more or less equal to the last one as far as entertainment value goes...Sadly it didn't have the soul or the ""wow factor"" that previous ones had.The acting wasn't particularly bad; even though Reeves and Moss looks a bit worn and tired in their roles this time around and the other actors that replaced Fishburn and Weaving just didn't manage to fill those shoes even though they did an okay enough job....If I had to sum this up - there was plenty of action as expected; and for the most part the main protagonists were accounted for....yet I still felt bored at times throughout the movie.....",4
3988,"To all the haters the haters out there I would say that the story is very good, and the scenes is what you woukd expect from the Matrix. New characters and the desired fight scenes.",10
3989,"An almost non-existent plot to which not a single character adds anything useful. This movie feels rushed and unimaginative. The characters are shallow, almost forced into the storyline, the sets are empty and boring, and the CGI was better in the first movie.Nothing in this movie makes sense and all the ideas and plotlines just seem to be there as to revive something that should have been left for dead. The new Morpheus lost everything the orignal character stood for. The pseudo-lovestory between Neo and Trinity is merely there to give the movie a reason to exist at all. The comeback of the Merovingian as a cursing hobo does absolutely nothing for the plot. The new Zion is useless and empty. An apparent war between machines is mentioned once, never touched again. The motives of the machines are nonsensical and their explanations are just bad and uncreative. With modern sci-fi I believe audiences are ready for complex topics like the prequels tried to simplify yet everything seems to be dumbed down to a point where the whole story becomes uninteresting.The sequel lost all of the atmosphere, the meaningful drive of the characters, the touch of hacker culture, the big brother, the unknown danger of some men in black, the mystery between reality and the virtual world, the action and tension of the prequels. A missing Fishburne and Weaving is just the icing of the disaster one could call a cake.Two stars instead of one because I was somewhat excited throughout the movie for something interesting to happen. Unfortunately it didn't.",2
3990,"Better than I expected, not just a cash grab. It was complicated but made sense. Would've like to see the original Mr Smith, a little more humor and I'm left wondering what's the actual end game. 7.5/10.",7
3991,"Really loved the latest installment, brilliantly done and so smoothly blended into the old story. Keanu Reeves is still a joy for the eyes. The love story is beautiful. Cannot fault anything in this movie, I think it was awesome!",10
3992,"Bloated, it's like ever since the Wachos became a hit with the first one everyone around them stopped questioning them, feels like they filmed the first draft of the script, and also refused to cut any scenes.This is what happens when you surround yourself with 'yes man' people.It's an interesting sequel to the first one, ignore the 2&amp;3 and it's a weird little movie.The fan service/flashback scenes are bad, should have been left out.Neil Patrick Harris explaining the movie to you in the middle of a fight for ten minutes straight should have been avoided.The New Zion scenes were so silly, Niobee looked funny in her make up.Cut 45 minutes off, all the humor, give it a more serious tone like the first one had focusing on technology and human mental wellness and would be a great film.Or at least could have filmed an animatrix script.",5
3993,"As the title boldly states, everyone who died in the previous film is now alive - ""resurrected"". Don't ask how, you will either be given some lame nonsense explanation or nothing at all. You just have to believe in magic like a small child who believes in fairy tales.Some of the main characters have been re-cast for no reason. These new actors don't hold a candle next to original cast and they should've been written as a completely new characters instead.Neo looks more like a John Wick with long hair and beard. He also behaves nothing like himself from previous movies. Keanu Reeve's acting is also distractingly bad, one of his worst performances to date.Pretentious trash. Movie thinks it's extremely clever by breaking the fourth wall and constantly poking fun at Warner Bros and entertainment industry in general. None of it is cute or funny, and feels more like a cheap fan-made parody.Niobe and Merovingian, the two iconic characters from previous films, have been totally butchered and turned into some insufferable jerks.The plot is extremely weak and thin, adds nothing useful to the Matrix universe and you barely learn anything interesting after the events of Revolutions. Worthless addition to the franchise.Action scenes are dull, filled with a bunch of quick cuts where it's difficult to tell what's going on. You'll never want to re-watch any of it again.The green tint is gone and the title font has been changed. Doesn't feel like the Matrix movie at all.The serious mature tone, themes, and atmosphere of the previous movies are gone, could easily be a family friendly PG-13 movie. Feels like it belongs in the Marvel or Disney catalogue.CGI and Soundtrack are extremely underwhelming. Visuals look cheap. It's a shocking lackluster considering that previous movies excelled in and revolutionized those technical departments. No memorable tracks whatsoever, nothing is cool about any of it.None of the supporting characters are good, some are downright annoying like every single one of Thomas Anderson's co-workers at his company.The whole rubbish idea that the previous movies are actually a part of some video game, a total unnecessary mess.Annoying flashbacks from older films that look completely out of place.Main villain is unintimidating, at times treated like a total wimp.Killer machines turned into a childish Hello Kitty robots giving humans hugs and kisses.A lot of cringe moments filled with overblown cheesy fantasy scenarios, rainbows and unicorns, that require the audience to dumb down and feel like you're watching some lame soap opera.Woke ending.",1
3994,"I couldn't wait to see this movie, i was excited to see more of the Matrix.Unfortunatelly , this film is not good enough.The trailor should include the scene where they explain how WB push them to make another one. It was 1:1 apology from the directors. They new this will never reach the hight of the trilogy.Taking into accout how many people loved the movie, i expect many bad comments here.This is why we should wait and see the score in imdb , before spending our money.Even Keany action scenes were not well shot.",1
3995,"It is literally a parody of the Matrix movie, who asked for this, why ruin a legendary film, for a quick buck? Shame.Why this keeps happening in hollywood is beyond me,and as far i can see,beyond many people, is that bloody dollar really worth destroying piece of art and creative marvel like the Matrix movies, gonna end up buying fake DaVinci photos at the market for 0.99$Hollywood went bellow low with this..",1
3996,"Personally it's better than matix 3, it's a good movie worth watching. The story is not the best but it's worth watching. Hope in next one we will get a better movie.",10
3997,"No, this is not a matrix film. I think some matrix haters made this film to kill matrix legend. I could not stay until the end and left the movie. Please leave Keanu Reeves alone, do not make him busy with such rubbish films.",1
3998,"I was hooked from the beginning - don't know why people seem to hate this movie so much?!***SPOILERS!A true mind game, and finally the ending we where hoping for - NEO &amp; TRINITY TOGETHER!",10
3999,"You and an adult Neo for 30 minutes are not completely sure is this the Matrix or not, and then for 2 hours Neo and a crowd of young people are taking Trinity out of the Matrix. In the process, it turns out for some facts. The Morpheus's ex is still alive and she rules the new city in reality. The city exists by the cooperation of free people and machines who are not interested in domination. The magnetism between Trinity and Neo is better source of energy than humans. Dying and resurrecting becomes a completely working way to obtain unusual forces even for hackers of the Matrix. This is about the plot. Some more about the modus. The power of a woman is strict, but they will 'feed delicious'. Fate is decided not only by your choice, but also by the choice of others. It is quite feministic and tolerant, but not to the point of absurdity. Inclusivity does not catch the eye at all.",10
4000,"Like any other fan of the matrix I was really excited for the new matrix film, and like most I was really disappointed. The Matrix was a unique film and game changer, the trilogy creates legacy for generations in both cinema and entertainment wise. The new part was not even a bad version of the original. It likes lets get approval from WB to make the 4th part before they starts without us and then lets think what kind of film we will make and the literally said this line ! And end up gathering shots from the trilogy during the whole film until it becomes annoying. The script is horrible, casting is very bad except for bugs who was the only bright character in here she gets all the 4 stars rating... yes more than Neo and Trinity, how did the director missed up that a new character is more memorable than your 2 leads! All other casts are forgettable and miss selected. Action scenes which was one of the unique parts in the original are very immature ,lame and more boring than the dialogue. Nothing worked here expect seeing Neo and Trinity together again. The director has failed her own legacy before failing us.",4
4001,"Anyone who has self-respect wouldn't watch this movie. I've never seen such a pointless, so ignorant, and empty film. Yes, I had great expectations for the movie, but the situation I'm experiencing right now is something beyond my expectations. I can accept a lot of things in the first act. The Matrix's main audience has finally grown old. They wanted to create a new story to touch the Z generation. They revised the universe in accordance with the conditions of the day. I understand these. But I can't understand the disgrace in the second act, I can't accept it. If you are going to the movies, get out after the first act and go home. Never mind, don't watch.",1
4002,Its better than Matrix 3 but it could been better without it. 2 The Ones? Thats good I love it the first half was boring and the second half was good.,5
4003,"The reason they thought it was a good idea o milk out all the innovative ideas the first movie came with is beyond me. We are 20 years after the 1st film was released and all we got are the same visuals in high resolution, Some weren't even rendered properly. Such a movie should have remained in the mind of it's creator because it has successfully ruined the reputation of the trilogy.",4
4004,"Nobody speaks about true point of movie (imo).1. will power : u can achieve whatever u want, as long as u put enough time and effort into a thing2. Transcendence or transvestitism : u can transcende (or u will) into what u deserve in afterlife according to the way u live today (or according to your actions in this life)2.1.or in general, u can transfert yourself into whatever u want. Physically and psy., its only your mind that limits or stops you3. Choice is everything : u get to choose your destiny, nothing is preset for ya, u make your own life and destiny throughout your choices u make every day (or a second for that matter)4. Neo is not jesus or messiah. He just has enough will power to ""jump out of average"". By doing so, he influences a lot of those, who dont wanna leave their comfort zone, and they are in ave of him, exacly how ppl see ""the messiahsses of todays world"". Another confirmation of this (my view) is that in last part, actually Trinity becomes ""the one""5.without hard work, and max effort, you cannot become what you can be. U will stay oblivious in your comfort zone, limited by your comfort, fear or ignorance. Point is :change and challenge yourself constantly in order to become THE ONE for yourself, others dont need to see it.6. there is no right or wrong, fault or whatever...but more on that if anyone replies or contact me.",10
4005,"The first matrix film was something so significant to human culture, that it will be referenced for decades to come. The two sequels, however, are best forgotten. This is why I should not be surprised that the 4th film in this series offers nothing but a disappointing remake. Could someone please tell film makers that nods to the old films work if they are subtle. This film is certainly not that. It's most major crime is to severely under use the pheonominal acting abilities of Carrie-Anne Moss. It feels like she is barely in it. Whilst Trinity's character in the first film was such a landmark in female portrayals on screen, it was far from perfect. She wasn't written with much depth or history. This new film was a chance to rectify this disservice. But of course that's not what happens. We have to watch Neo being talked at about what happened in the first film, cause apparently it was a game he came up with. It felt like a poor recap for audience members who couldn't remember the previous triology. Keanu Reeves reaction to all of this is only slightly more animated than if he were replaced by a pair of sunglasses and a long coat. Nothing good happens until you see the beautiful world outside the matrix, where machine, computer program and human have built a city together. That part was truly incredible. Alas it has such a small role. Eventually we return to a world where Neo fixes everything so easily with one wave of his hands and everyone dresses in very outdated clothes. Nothing about this film is cool anymore. Why exactly did they make it? Currently, there is a court case about whether distributing it on hbo max at the same time as in cinemas hit the box-office numbers. It was so poorly written, it might be a better explanation.",1
4006,"I had some expectations for this movie but it was a big let down, it was slow clumsy and boring.....it really wasn't good and u think it may have killed the franchise after this one, stick with the original three and avoid this Disaster.",4
4007,"I knew I was in for a bad experience when they spent the majority of the beginning having to explain everything. Like ""lets take the curiosity and self-discovery out of the equation and let me tell you all about the reason this film exists"". It became clear that it shouldn't. All the ""remember this"" moments that start right off the bat put a sour taste in my mouth. It took me back to the interview with Keanu and Carrie-Anne before release where both weren't excited about the film. The fight scenes, what can I say: generic Hollywood trash. Not unique, not visually stimulating, not that creative. In other words, not The Matrix. Then Lana Wachoski broke another Matrix trademark: original actors. It's not just Keanu and Carrie-Anne that made the Matrix. There's Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving, to name a couple. They're so iconic that not having them should've delayed the whole film. Jonathan Groff as Agent Smith, who in their right mind thought that was a good choice? He didn't even portray the character at all. Complete mismatch. The other critique was Keanu, they need to know how to work him to get the best out of him and sad to say that was not the case here. Keanu doesn't even look like he wants to be in the film. Making Trinity a motorcycle builder with her soft hands and motherly looks didn't fit at all, not to mention those were Arch motorcycles; Keanu's company which made it seem like some weird advertisement. And then making the Merovingian look and act homeless wasn't funny and didn't fit. It'd have been better not having him in the film at all. And Niobe, what the hell went wrong here? It's like you went out of your way to screw that up. She's like a claymation Jamaican beggar that's pissed off she can't find her steel drums.This film missed every check mark a Matrix film should have. The Wachoskis don't have it anymore.In regards to this film, Cypher says it best: I don't want to remember nothing. Well, except maybe Jessica Henwick, the only positive thing out of the film.",1
4008,"I went to school for philosophy and concentrated in epistemology, so when a few years later The Matrix was released, I kicked myself for not writing it myself. It was Descartes' ""brain in a vat"", and very little more. But I loved it. This iteration really brings nothing of meaning other than a tired retread of the current situation where Republicans are happy to accept whatever reality is presented to them without questioning if it's real or even passes the sniff test of a brain damaged adolescent. ""Reality"" has become a ""choose your own adventure"" children's book for a significant portion of our electorate, and this movie points that out. But who doesn't know that already?The original added something to most people's universe, this one just repeats common, overly trodden themes.I like Keanu (""the wall"") not only because he's Canadian and a goalie (if he doesn't play in a beer league, he's missing out), but because he's apparently sane, intelligent, and generous, so I hope he got a huge payday. I hope he donates some of it to some wildlife rehabbers which are always WELL at the bottom of the heap in terms of donations, but due to global warming, are actually more towards the top in need.",
4009,"It was a fun fan film. This director has a future I can tell. Hahaha this movie is just the same script as the first one, just little little tiny tweaks that's it. Honestly I rather see a sequel to speed racer, that one was better. It was entertaining and I like the ideas in the beginning but went no where. Setup for another trilogy that won't happen probably.",4
4010,"I think it's a fresh look on the matrix universe. Of course the original trilogy is out of this world. We all can agree. But the new storyline they created, the new matrix they created, it's pretty good.

4011,"Everything about this movie is bad. Casting, directing, acting, special effects, fight choreography, story.I would like to point out nonsense elements in this film, so that you could understand better why I think this film is bad:Why is Smith in this new Matrix? Machines paid dearly to get rid of him. His existence in new Matrix is redundant.Morpheus' return to real world should have been significant in IO (the new Zion) , but it looked like nobody gave a damn about it, including Niobe.Why did they need ""coded Morpheus"" to get Neo out of Matrix? That didn't make sense.Why did Smith attack Neo in the middle of the film? I think they wanted the audience to watch Smith vs Neo fighting again, worse they copied fight choreography from the 1st film.Morpheus didn't look like Morpheus, he looked like a clown.Neo and Trinity generating more power when they are close was rubbish.I didn't like they often showed parts of first 3 films to remind audience, that was cheap.",2
4012,"There's definitely a lot of hormones going on with this whole movie. But hey, let's get woke y'all. For real though, the movie wasn't bad. My expectations were just much higher. Don't take my word for it though. It's definitely worth watching.",7
4013,"So many bad reviews for this film have been given, but not from me. I enjoyed every single moment of it, sure there are flashbacks of the other 3 films but that's what makes it brilliant, and unless you've seen the other 3 then you won't get these. Neo &amp; Trinity are still played by their original actors, unfortunately Laurence Fishburne isn't in this one, but there's a very good reason why in this movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the others.",10

4015,"It was so sad to see how the story was twisted... it was better to progress with new characters.In addition there were some fillers/characters that was not necessary at all, referring to the shouting frenchman for example.I rated the movie 6, just for the hard effort in CGI and some good acting / actors.",6
4016,I genuinely think the reviews at 5 or below are way too harsh I've watched it twice now and taken different meanings from both views which in itself is a positive attributeI admit it's a bit sketchy for storyline compared to the original trilogy but if I'd seen this movie as a standalone without knowing or seeing the previous movies I'd be impressed I'm sure most would agree after reflecting on it as standalone rather than a continuation which I think it is7/10.,7
4017,"The Matrix Resurrections continues the plot of original trilogy of Neo the Chosen who is ressurreced by machines and put into Matrix again for some stupid purpose. Keanu Reeves and Carie Ann-Moss return as main cast, but support cast is completely new.As great and mindblowing original The Matrix was, as dissapointing and boring this movie is. Even sequels were not particularly great but were at very least still entertaining. New guys try to do their best, but I had feeling both Reeves and Ann-Moss already had enough and heard rumours that Wachowzki did not wanted fourth movie but was forced to do so. The movie struggles to figure itself out, plot makes little sence and cinematography fails to capture atmosphere and feel of original. There are some decent special effects and fights going on, but that is it. Can't say it's terrible, there was clearly some effort put into it but overall it just didn't work for me and left dissapointed.",5
4018,"It is humorous that just over 11% of watchers get this and see what a masterpiece it is. My expectations were blown away; but I now remember I have always been able to trust Lana Wachowski- BRAVO to Lana and Crew! This film is honestly fantastic- all the characters, the acting, the storyline, incredible staging, writing, screenplay...the direction is flawless. Each performance so nuanced and enhanced. And a love story so exciting and badass. And no misogynist tropes made this appealing on every level. BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO!!!",10

4024,"I've rewatched the Matrix Trilogy this week, in preparation for Matrix Resurrections it and makes sense why it has such a cult following and why they have remained so iconic all these yearsNow, almost 20 years later, Matrix Resurrections is released and I could easily say it might be the worst sequel to a movie I've ever seen.Everything about this movie is a joke, it is a film that literally laughs at its existence and trashes a saga that ended perfectly well while doing so.Visually, it looks like a TV Spot or a low production TV show instead and is far from the photography the original trilogy had and its classic green-ish tones look.Its characters are forgettable, corny, the acting is pretty bad (even from Keanu), but I think this is more due to the directing than anything, and the story, above everything, is shockingly terrible, at the point that makes the movie unbearable.I am not one to mock on movies or sequels, I pretty much enjoy watching any movie, the only movie which I was desperately wanting for it to end while watching it was the original Suicide Squad, but this is even worse.There is no cohesion in the different events happening, this sequel feels like a recycling of the originals by constantly showing flashbacks of the previous filma and it even basically copies other (Zombie) movies like Train to Busan and World War Z (yes, the story is so nuts that Matrix is somehow a Zombie movie at parts).The only good about the movie is the visual FX and its sound.I just can't imagine how Keanu and Carrie-Anne Moss could accept this role, and how Larry Wachowski (now known as Lana Wachowski) could have written this movie, when two decades ago she was partly responsible for one of the most legendary pieces of entertainment ever made.Again, I am not the kind of person that hates on ""different"" sequels, as a fan of Alien I enjoyed Resurrection and as a Star Wars junkie I enjoyed Rise of Skywalker even if I would have wanted something completely different, but Matrix Resurrections is an insult to an iconic saga and an insult to cinema in general.",2
4025,Coming from the matrix one to this with high expectations is the worst choice i made in my life. And also i created this IMDB account only to review this movie badly because i never ever want to see a similar movie like this again.!,1
4026,"Created an account purely because I can't contain my disgust at what a dreadful movie this is. From scene one to the closing credits, it's awful in every single way. Bad acting, bad casting, bad script, bad story, bad dialogue, bad cinematography, bad direction, bad pacing, bad chemistry, bad characters, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.This has entered my Premier League of dreadful films I've ever had the misfortune to spend my time on.It has no redeeeming features whatsoever, I genuinely do not see the artistic merit of creating this movie other than a cynical cash-in on the first Matrix, which is of course one of the greatest films ever made.Avoid this movie until you can see it, and waste your time, for free.Anyone who has Covid should be forced to watch this, so they can sigh the virus out of themselves.It is awful beyond description.",1
4027,"Pretty shocked by the very low rating. Yes, it pales compared to the original, but it's actually a step up from the second and third movies.If you're someone that found Reloaded and Revolutions disappointing and go in with measured expectations, this is definitely worth seeing on a big screen.",7
4028,"Look. I missed the sequels growing up, only saw Matrix 1 in theaters and it was on another level. Then upon watching Matrix 2/3 recently, I was underwhelmed by the boring dialogue and war theme. I had a feeling the newest matrix was gonna be equally bad. And it most certainly was, somehow even worse. But I wanna say this: after accepting that it indeed was bad (like, laughingly bad, and also confusing), then watching the first three movies again, there's something refreshing about the new one that I will say has upped my rating from a 2-3 to above 5. And I think it's that I simply just need something to watch. I know, it's really sad to place the newest matrix as ""something to watch"" but it does have ""ugly spouse"" qualities that I have come to enjoy.My advice is, close your eyes when the scenes start getting bad and you'll get through it in no time.Sorry. Maybe the re-reboot will be much better, like Batman or Spider-Man.",6
4029,The original trilogy was quite intense and dour. And this puts a positive cap on the saga. It's corny as hell and funny all around. With some clever ideas and good characters. Don't go in expectating an intense action packed movie. This is a film that celebrates love and the triumph of good. Just enjoy it if you can.,7
4030,"Not boring but not interesting either. For those who have seen Matrix 1st part this resurrections is a dull remake of original. For those who have not seen Matrix - they could love it. Personally- i have seen Matrix- this was a OK movie. Nothing surprising, easily predictable and that way it is not interesting.",5
4031,"Unitl now any movie with the resurrection word kinda sucks for some reason.So if you looking to see the matrix 4, you will be disappointed. But if you want to see a mediocre action movie you may like it but not so much.No thriller in the movie, you can fast forward and miss nothing, in short it's a bad story and bad writing, they just wanted to make another matrix movie but didn't know how to do it right.They should have at least respected the last three movies and did something that worth it.",7
4032,"As a Matrix fan, I was looking forward to the fourth live action movie but did not have high expectations. The strange thing was that while the film takes a new grip on the story, it is familiar. Too familiar. It feels like shortcuts have been taken just about everywhere and it does not get any better that they have used about 75% too many clips from old Matrix movies to maintain a sustainable level of freshness. Here, a stronger story could have elevated the film.At the same time as I saw something exciting emerge on the screen, there was a feeling of a B-remake. I understand that hard core fans feel disappointed in many ways. The frame story is brilliant but the ongoing story is thin. The movie does not quite reach the level with the two live action sequels to the first movie but almost. In any case, I did not expect that either. It's hard to follow up on such a success as the original trilogy and live up to expectations. After all, they have at least overcome my worst fears about how bad it could have been. A compliment for that. The flashbacks were too many and strangely exposed. They should have been replaced by a better story. The acting was not 100% convincing but a compliment to several of the younger actors. A lot of action scenes were like in most films, but of course there was some innovation that tickled a little extra. There were both some variations on classic Matrix action but also some originality. The end felt a bit final. There is an opening in this story for a new direction in The Matrix universe and a sequel that could provide a wealth of new stories. Somehow it feels like someone wants to put a little vague end to the story of Neo and Trinity.After all, the movie is clearly worth seeing and satisfies those who wanted to see Neo and Trinity once again put on the black coats. My rating will not be better than six, even if it is with doubt that I set it so high. The satisfaction of a sequel that did not quite suck really badly probably influenced me to give it an extra point. Had I not been a fan, it would probably have stopped at five or maybe even just five on a cloudy day.",7
4033,"The first Matrix resonated with the feelings of many of us, weaving together our perception of what's real and a deep understanding of the concept of choice. It had a lot to say and it was brilliantly executed in terms of both storytelling and visual arts.In contrast, The Matrix Resurrections has nothing new to say. It is almost entirely driven by an uncreative imitation of the storytelling of the first Matrix. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss did their best, but nothing could save an artistically uninspired failed attempt of resurrecting a legend.Lana Wachowski should have passed on this.",5
4034,"You remember the first Movies of Monsters from Pixar where children's fear was the source of power for the Monster's world? Well, to sum it up, Matrix's new Creator states that Neo's dreams and scares were the source of ultimate power for the robot world. Talk about diminishing the original ideas.So lets go over the basics of the Matrix movies 1 through 3, a world where AI became dependant on humans to survive imprisoning them in a Dream world to keep them alive and simply drain their body energy for electricity. Then, some humans want freedom and decide that anyone should have the right to be set free.This movie took out everything of that idea and basically recreated a new movie. We are continuously, during the first half of the movie, shown images of the previous movies. That's just pure cheap usage. When you need previous movie images to make you understand what you are looking at, you know that the movie drops much lower than its predecessors.We are introduced to a somewhat, flashbackable, explanation to new skins on previous characters such as Agent Smith and Morpheus. We got the French dude that appears as an old bearded man that does nothing at all but show that he can pronounce a few words in french.In no way are we feeling this weird connection between Agent Smith and Neo and even by the end we are set back to The Analyst being beaten up by our fan favourite Matrix couple.The movie had good ideas with the new bullet time explanation to remodel the Matrix, Neo and Trinity's strong bond but the story failed to provide good basic information on their importance. We also are greeted with an ultra old Niobe in charge of a somewhat peaceful civilization in jeopardy with Trinity's retrieval but never get to fully see the results of Neo's acts.You will spend more than half of the movie seeing a weak Neo and backtracking information to explain what's happening. This movie had potential but failed to deliver with the original ideas it had. When looking back at the second movie, we are taught that the Matrix has been recreating Neo several times as well as Trinity. So why is this movie requiring to reconstruct their mutilated bodies if they can simply be remodeled with a re-implant of their previous memories?Too many questions left unanswered for a Movie this complex. And what shall I say about the Matrix video game presented in the movie as well as their puch line to define a new game with the same title as the movie. This was unoriginal, uninspired and very cheaply written.We'll also go with Morpheus who fights against Neo to...I don't know why...somehow punch reason in him???This movie has too many holes which makes it a 2h45 deception.Lets also talk about sound effects where everything seemed less loud, less punchy. Its like if they were punching bad guys through a towel to cover up the sounds. The special effects have less power in them compared to the previous movies where we could actually feel the intensity of explosions and gun fights.I think for Matrix Lovers out there, it can make for a possible good Neo and Trinity Resurrection but the story is a dead skeleton.",6
4035,"Having grew up with The Matrix Trilogy. Revolution came out half my life ago. Was extremely excited for this after hearing the announcement and couple of trailers. Thinking this is going to be epic like the last 3. Sadly, I didn't felt that, felt more like a long pilot for Netflix or Amazon. Heard this cost $190 million to make, still can't believe it. Anything that was not clearly explained from the trilogy, it badly done with amateur writing. Lana should make fantasy TV series only, not blockbusters films. This got annoying flashbacks clips from the trilogy throughout the film which it doesn't needed at all. Because of that, it reminds me of the terrible Uwe Boll's House Of The Dead. Yes, the actors, some of the actions and sfx were good. Can't say about the lazy script. I had many chuckles which it wasn't meant to be, cos of the bad filmmaker. After slacking it off, I did enjoy it. Should I believe this should have a sequel...no. Change into a tv series for streaming...yes. See it for free with absolutely no expectations. Lana, I expected a lot more from you, even though you made Speed Racer and Jupiter Acending. Keane Reeves looks like a bored John Wick in this. Newcomers did well, hopefully they will do well with future films. It's okay, nothing spectacular.Vce.",5
4036,I liked the plot. The transition was clever. Still you must be familiar with the deep idea of Matrix 1999 in order to dive into the substance of the film.,9
4037,"This is a good continuation of the series considering it is a continuation of a iconic series. There may be some elements of the script that weren't as impressive as the first one, but this wasn't a movie that needed to put the director in the map and gain fame, she already has that. It's understandable it wouldn't be as impressive. Overall, good movie that is worth watching. They also do a good job of thinking through a reasonable way to continue to series that doesn't feel like they are just trying to make money even though that's why the movie was made.",8
4038,"I'm a bit conflicted when it comes to rating this movie. The mere existence of the movie is problematic, because it feels like they're spending an entire movie explaining why they made another Matrix movie.I will say, I enjoyed the way they came into it, turning the plot into meta commentary for the Matrix franchise. It was humorous, but it also worked. Honestly, the beginning of the film is interesting and the reasons behind the plot are really clever, but it DOES feel a bit meaty. There is no room to build new characters, since the entire movie is a long explanation for why it happened. Instead, we mostly see characters that we already know. This is obviously the main selling point of the movie, and I liked Neo and Trinity, but some of the old characters felt awkward this time around, like Niobe, Merovingian and agent Smith. They couldn't bring back Hugo Weaving, so Smith has a new face in this movie. It makes sense in the universe, but it's not very satisfying in the film.Also, after the opening, the movie feels like it's running on autopilot for a bit. Of course, there is a lot of action, but where the original movies made iconic scenes that were awesome to look at, all this movie can manage is a lot of quickly edited camera shaking. Sure, there is choreography and slow motion shots and whatnot, but it doesn't stand out from the dullness of modern action. The action scenes ended up feeling extremely pointless, and I found myself wishing them to be over so we could get back to the ACTUAL film. If you cut away all the pointless action, I think you actually have a pretty decent Matrix movie. There is a scene before the final sequence of mayhem in a cafe. I actually loved this scene, and thought it was super cool. There was a lot of tension, a lot of stakes and the line before the action kicked off was awesome.To summarize, this movie's biggest problem is that it has to explain too much. I found my patience dwindling towards the end. The new characters were not given a proper chance to shine, which I hope will change in Matrix movies to come (if they make any more). The story itself is actually pretty good, but they ruined it with too much crappy action. I want to complement the overall theory behind the plot, as well as the opening act, and there were a couple of other scenes that felt good (great cafe scene), but it's inevitably a bit boring with the indulgence in bad action and the introduction of a lot of characters we know nothing about and as a result, don't care for. But to be fair, if you want to revive the Matrix franchise, you need to do a lot of chores before you can get to the good stuff. Now that all the boring explaining is out of the way, the next movies could expand on the new Matrix, the new characters and make some hopefully great movies again.",6
4039,"I really wanted to see a resurrection of the original movie, but i guess they lost its soul in the process but the movie is ok i guess, the reason they lost the Matrix touch first the VFX was too much different from the original and that played a big part, the characters mind set had a big impact on the movie, i don't understand how the people who wrote the script didn't know this i think this was rushed or poorly made, two things ruined the whole movie , to revive something like this you need to use the original soul and story as it's fuel , using those small flashback's was a bad idea, wish you the best but i guess this movie is done.",6
4040,"The story 9/10 dialogue and new characters 7/10 action sequences and visuals 5/10 WTF had do you go backwards with new technology. Some parts were very clever and cool. I like were it could possibly going, but I feel like this could have been 2 movies.",7
4041,"What a huge disappointment!Terrible acting by most of the cast, a weak Storyline and it all just feels like a desperate move to squeeze some more money out of the Matrix-Franchise. Very sad!!",5
4042,Solid 6.5 stars. Would be a fun evening with popcorn movie. Solid visuals and decent acting. Do not go looking for any deep meta ideas in conjunction with a few new original concepts written in with the old ones. I liked it better than 2 and 3 but not by mutch. I liked how it made fun of itself noting that perhaps they were not going mega serious with it.,6
4043,"This...wasn't...good!It's really sad because there are probably good stories to tell with theMatrix franchise, even with Neo (though supposedly dead at the end of Revolutions).Actually, the first part leads to some interesting plots, giving a critical view of Hollywood's lack of originality for the last years......And then, during the second part, it totally falls to this lack of originality.Serving lots of candies for fans (""Remember that character? He's right here!"", ""remember that scene? Here's a copy!""), etc...And actually nearly meaning that what was the point of the trilogy just lead to...nothing!The HtH fights are just...boring and you know what, a Matrix story doesn't absolutely require HtH fights to be a good ""Matrxi"").The agents (or in general, anyone firing at the heroes) are as skilled as a stormtrooper firing at someone in a corridor.Actually, doing this was not necessary (just like Toy Story 4 for example).So, why a 5 : for the interesting first part, a few decent action scenes and the good work of Neil Patrick Harris who deserves recognition for lifting up the quality of the film.",5
4044,Weak story.Good actors.Unclear Subject.Good end Good music favourite for keanu reeves.Unclear continuity.Very good directory.Good action.The best screen.,8
4045,It has to be that all the sequels are hated and it is usually because we are so small minded. Just like the story if we just follow the idea that the choice is an illusion and we do what we are destined is the best punchline. The movie is very good in its own way with great conversations which were missing in the ones before.Great return.,9
4046,"Honestly i went in with very low expectations given 2 and 3 were pretty poor movies. Nothing will ever live up to the first one which for me is one of my all time favourite movies. I was pleasantly surprised with this, maybe it was the nostalgia, but i found it enjoyable, don't go in with crazy expectations because it won't live up to them but did i enjoy it? Yes. Enough action and good level of flashbacks to the previous films, the dialogue wasn't very good it has to be said.But if you likes The Matrix franchise you'll go see it.",7
4047,"This film advanced many original Matrix ideas. I can see why some viewers were made to ""feel"" uncomfortable because the Analyst had their false emotional comfort reality nailed down!",8
4048,Here's a movie that tried to hard to be good but was dull as the 2nd and 3rd movies. Some nostalgia but it just doesn't hold a candle to the first one.,7
4049,"What can I say, this film was absolutely awesome, I enjoyed every minute of it especially the new characters but of course seeing neo and trinity back on screen together, however the low raters who don't 'get' the film drag the score down again!!!",10
4050,I mean the action is good. The story is so all over the place I was left unable to attach myself to any of the characters. It's just blah. The original is a masterpiece. The others were.....progressively worse. This could be a nice jumping off point perhaps but the ending made me hope it's not. Just leave it alone and let it be. Maybe come out with some dope Matrix video games with deep story lines. I would buy that. This left me wishing I went to bed early.,7
4051,"Respected keanu reeves sir, i am your big fans but as a audience i wasn't entertainfrom this movie. In Matrix 1,2 and 3 all of you come in matrix world and come out in real world by any telephone which was looking so thriller type but in this movie their is no mean how to come in matrix world and go out from matrix world looking so unrealastic and the character of Agent Smith is too nice but in this new part ""The matrix Resurrection"" no any negative character is touching the role of smith. If my review heart you then i sincercly apologize.",5
4052,"Just responding to the top review here: Hugo Weaving did not turn down the chance to do this film.He said that before he read the script he wasn't sure if he wanted to play Smith again, but after reading the script he was excited to do it. The only reason he's not in the film is because of a scheduling conflict with a theater play he was in.",10
4053,"Not a Matrix super fan, but I liked the originals a lot, I genuinely enjoyed this movie. I think a lot of people are rating it low as they're comparing to the first film, which is sort of a masterpiece. This definitely isn't that, and although it has some direct similarities (even clone scenes of the trilogy), it's a very different type of movie. If you like the idea of the matrix I think you'll enjoy this film, and while it's not as good as the trilogy, it's a different type of story and is good on its own right.",8
4054,"God, this was boring. A poor re-telling of the original, with the same action sequences but completely OTT and unconvincing. Dialogue bordering on the funny it was so pretentious. And the thin veil of a story is only revealed in the last 45 mins, when it is all rushed though. The film has no soul or substance and the set pieces are a mess.",2
4055,"I understand the criticisms about the new movie. But it was done pretty well imo. The new characters were really interesting especially bugs. The concepts and ideas introduced were very new and amazing.They did not blatantly copy the script of the original (like many movies these days-the force awakens, Jurassic world, Ghostbusters 2016);and actually put some effort in writing the script.And the concepts and plot of the original movies is not harmed in any way, but expanded more through this.Our beloved characters are old now and are not represented as indestructible. I really loved the character development of some characters. The meta perspective and jokes were the only accepted way in which a sequel would have worked.Most of the people are disappointed because they expected something very different from this movie. But resurrections is just a simple love story of Neo and Trinity. It works as a sort of epilogue to the trilogy and has a lot of heart in the story.This movie should really be appreciated more, because it really did something very interesting with a sequel that i have never seen before.Don't try to compare it with original and take it as it is. People often try to find so much bad stuff about a movie, that they forget to see good stuff in it.It is not that bad and you should give it a chance and decide yourself.:)",10
4056,Very disappointing. Keanu Reeves should of turned down the movie role if Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving wasn't gonna be in it they might aswel swapped neo with fresh Prince of bel air which they was gonna do but will smith turned it down what a joke just killed the franchise off with new low budget actors I definitely won't be buying the new collection with this init don't waste your time.,1
4057,"While many are entirely split on M. IV (The Matrix Resurrections), I am entirely convinced that it's an amazing movie due to this very outcome. Why? Not many entirely understood the Matrix when it first released, people were more blown away by it's effects and visual presentation. Today, we are given the exact opposite; a less attractive paint of coat, yet, has an even more deeper approach to our reality that many completely missed while judging it's outer appearance. In other words, those that didn't like it didn't understand it's approach. They expected more of the same. What we got was exactly the message everyone needs right now, not 1999 us, but 2020 us. Spoiled by marvel films that mimic matrix hero concept and effects, this the anti-sequel; anti-matrix; anti-reboot that directs us toward being anti-us.As in the past, so as Now: Many will Hate what they can't digest/process/understand because they're in denial over the way their ""red pilled"" lives currently exist as. ;) It's not a special effects over the top masterpiece, it's an abstraction of that very experience. It's purpose is a metaanalysis of it's previous stories tied to our present system and it's ""woke"" culture as another layer of digital distraction to keep us entranced as energy sources (in a debt system, currency is the energy).The split reviews (literally love or hate reviews, no in-between), is a testament upon the Dynamics that have existed during the past several years (post-Trump). It's doing exactly what it set out to do. Now only will some of us awake to it's message while the rest choose to remain in a loop of artificial dreams; blue pills choosing a metaverse over our universe.On that note, hope you enjoy now knowing what type of film the fourth is. It's has humor toward today, while existing as an indie action dark romance (the bond of Trinity and Neo is the heart of this entry, whereas the brain is pointed toward our reality). It's not anything like what has come other than repeating the core message of control. Beyond that, it's a huge breath of fresh air for anyone clever &amp; smart enough to understand it.""If we don't know what's true, we can't resist. They took your story, something that meant so much to people like me...and turned it into something trivial. That's what the Matrix does. It weaponizes every idea."" - Bugs, M. IV.",10
4058,"The matrix resurrections continues the original story, giving us answers to our questions, trying to overwhelm us with unusual plot twists, and sometimes it turns out that.But unfortunately, film's budget looks like ocket change.Also, the plot just normal and won't turn out your mind.Fights are bad, new color correction - bad.It would be better if they did it the old-fashioned way.I consider that films isn't exist, original trilogy is much better.",6
4059,"So I didn't get my hopes up for Resurrections. The first half was basically The Matrix. Finding Neo, convincing him to take the red pill, ""is this real"" blah blah. BUT it was nostalgic and entertaining and funny (and yes sometimes cheesy). The Matrix movies were never humorous like this so it deviated from the format. I actually appreciated and enjoyed the change. I feel like overly serious action movies are a thing of the past thanks to Marvel, and I like that.One of the great things about the first Matrix was that it pioneered some great action sequences. Resurrections was more of the same old same old. The over the head back kick, bullet stopping, fast blur motion punches and bullet dodging etc., everything we loved and still love about the original trilogy. Resurrections also tries to introduce a new power and it was cool but not mind blowing or particularly new and creative. So while There was no thinking outside the box with this one, it was still bad ass!The pace was SLOW. The entire first hour and a half is Neo trying to decide if the Matrix is real or if he's crazy and waffling back and forth. It was a bit excessive but I think they were trying to introduce the new cast to us and connect with them. So they get a pass on that.The Morpheus thing was ridiculous. They could have done without him entirely. It's like his entire character was created to make fun of the original Morpheus. That was my least enjoyable portion of the movie. Actually he's probably one of my least favorite characters of all time.Neo was so overpowered by the end of the first trilogy that they had to tear him down a bit (which was hard to watch) and then build him back up. But he still doesn't stand on his own. I think it's great he isn't the only ""one"" but it takes away from his strength. Neo had such force of will and confidence in himself and Resurrection just destroyed it all by making him codependent on Trinity which is lame.The plot was a bit weak. They tried to set up Bugs as the new leader, and Jessica did a wonderful job, however the characters reasons for going against orders and rescuing Neo were almost nonexistent aside from the fact that ""he's Neo"". I guess the writers were hoping we'd look past that just so they could bring Neo back? Then we spent the rest of the movie trying to figure out who the big bad was. And while we love me some NPH, he just didn't have the ""it"" factor as the bad guy here.And what the heck is up with agent Smith?! Where did he come from, what is he up to, why did he step in at the coffee shop? Why is he calling Neo Thomas now instead of Mr Anderson? Is he the big bad again? I mean...what?! I have so many questions. So. Many. Questions!Wow, originally I gave this movie a 9 out of 10. I thoroughly enjoyed and the nostalgia was wonderful. But writing the review has me thinking I'm blinded by that nostalgia. I wasn't disappointed yet I wasn't impressed either. So while I thoroughly enjoyed it, it wasn't earth shattering and it didn't make me fall in love with it. Would I watch it again? Absolutely. Would I watch any sequels? Absolutely. They definitely need a more cohesive and creative story if they manage to produce another movie.",7
4060,"All these negative reviews here are really focused too much on this movie being ""worthy"". The movie brings back Neo and Trinity in basically what could be described as a short story that takes place decades after the original Trilogy ends. If you ask me, it was fun to watch some of the old characters in this updated universe and it was massive fun to see a 2021 Matrix movie with updated visual- and audio qualify. It was an interesting little story and watching Keanu is always good. I dont think i will be watching it again but i dont regret seeing it at all!",7
4061,"For those gave low ratings, clearly you have watched way too many movies and got spoiled real bad and I wonder what kind of highs were you expecting from a movie. As a huge Matrix fan since 2000, the story in Resurrection makes all the sense, it was entertaining, surprising and well done in every angle. As a fan, if there was ever a sequel, this is exactly how it should be, and I loved it. Only thing I feel is it could actually be quite a bit longer to unravel some of the reality events slower to put more weight and meaning. Otherwise, those of you who got so spoiled expected to get your mind blown to the Jupitar, go find other recreational activities to do as you probably will struggle to get highs again from a movie.",9
4062,"Everything was lit! If you were just a fan of the old trilogy just because of the action, then of course you're disappointed. As much as action packed and visually stunning resurrections was, there were also as much meaningful conversations which made it a blend of fun and seriousness and that's what I expected from the matrix.",10
4063,"Kind of plausible explanation for the heroes' resurrection. Repetition of classic scenes and lines felt nostalgic but sometimes boring at the same time. Decent action sequences and effects. Average acting. The most important thing is that the film maintains the Matrix feeling and really feels as a sequel and not just a spin-off or reboot or remake as most sequels these days do. I understand that the main reason for shooting this sequel was money, but, nonetheless, at least it delivered as an ok sequel, taking into consideration the years, the aging and the absence of some original actors. 6 or 7/10. I give 7 because it's Christmas time 😛",7
4064,"🎬THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS🎬🕶💏🤔Stars: Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jonathan Groff, Jessica Henwick, Neil Patrick Harris. Directed by: Lana Wachowski. 148 mins. (15)Mr Anderson is once again caught between two realities. Is the Matrix real, or not? What is his past? Just what is going on? Woah!The original Matrix is one of my all-time favourite movies and rightfully regarded as a seminal piece of landmark cinema. The two following sequels were a prime example of diminishing returns, although I do maintain ""Reloaded"" can still be enjoyed as an action spectacle.Naturally, I was worried that this new 4th installment would be a bad idea after nearly 20 years since the trilogy 'concluded'. Made more so that I'm not a fan of any of the Wachowski directors' work in recent years. Combined with some scathing reviews by longtime fans and generally hated by the movie-going public (although it fairs better by some critics), I was prepared for a real turkey. Well, tis the season!Well ya know what? I think I'm in the minority here as I quite enjoyed this. Rather than a shameless cash-in, I found it to be inventive with some good ideas. You can tell that writer/ director Lana Wachowski has actually put some effort into the script, to cleverly weave in a continuation of the story that was already supposedly concluded.I can see why it's been received to be so divisive, and I can understand why some hate it. But, for me, it actually surprised me and thought it had some refreshing ideas. It could've easily been a lazy rehash and, yes, while it does lean in heavily by referencing the original (even lifting the same dialogue and scenes) it never felt like shameless callbacks, thanks to its unique meta spin on its own universe.Of course, it never reaches the mind-blowing dizzying heights of the original in terms of its story and action. At times, it actually felt like a smaller companion piece. While it could never better or replicate that ""wow"" factor of the first movie's action scenes, it still has some solid enough and enjoyable moments.It was fun to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprising their roles as Neo and Trinity but the rest of the cast are, unfortunately, pretty forgettable. This is where the movie is at its weakest. There are no real strong or interesting characters, outside of our two heroes and is sorely missing Lawrence Fishburn and, especially, Hugo Weaving as baddie Agent Smith. The villains this time around are far less memorable. Its clear the film's main focus is the enduring love between Neo and Trinity, with everyone else serving as mere plot divices.Aside from the two leads, this movie is more about the why and how, rather than the who. It has some lofty, headache-inducing ideas that, I'm sure, can easily be ripped apart and scoffed at. Yes, it can be exposition heavy at times and I can see some people being bored/confused with its techno-babble extended talking scenes. However, the fact it was trying to do something a bit different impressed me. Agreed, not everything worked and it definitely has flaws - but I'd rather it try and stumble than play it safe.So forget what you think you know, and free your mind...and you may be pleasantly surprised.AMR rating: 71% ⭐⭐⭐🌠",7
4065,"I watched it 3 times on IMAX. Loved every minute of it. Neo, Trinity, and all the the other characters were great. The plot was great - leaving the door open for more sequels to come! Yes, please, send me down the rabbit hole!!!!!",10
4066,"I find myself wondering why this movie was ever made and why Keanu Reeves even agreed to play the part of Neo again. This movie was so entirely bad and pointless, I will make a point to NEVER watch anything the director has ever been apart of.",4
4067,"Waste of life, absolute trash. Brings shame to the previous trilogy. Absolutely do not watch.No clear plot line, nothing makes sense. They raped Neo...",1
4068,"So I could give this 4 thumbs down.The Matrix trilogy, even with the sub par sequels, are top 10 movies ever in my opinion. It's hard for me to even explain how good I found the first movie to be, and I didn't even watch it until 2010 even though I'm 36 years old.This was, without a doubt the worst anti-climax I've ever experienced movie wise. Awful. Absolutely awful. The second star is out of pity.",2
4069,The legend of sequel is crashed in the mind of their fans after watching the fourth movie ... i thought the director will show a tremendous ideas and great new cinematic moments but sadly the work was frustrating ... i hope the crue apologize to their fans about what happened.,4
4070,"I've remember watchin the first trilogy when I was still a kid, one of those sort of movies that get embedded in my mind and got my interest in sci fi genre, it has a very special place in my hearth since it inspired me to enter working in entertainment industry.Watching this movie I've already had high expectations from it, you had iconic characters, room for developing great plot, same movie director and writer, what could possible go wrong..... even cinematography and visuals back then when the first trilogy was made it still looks awesome, what is this now?The fact that trough entire film you get sort of ""flashbacks"" seeing scenes from old movies got me frustrated even more because I've remember how awesome it was watching those compare with the one I'm watching now...If you decide to watch it remember that you don't set high expectation from it especially if you are a hardcore fan from original trilogy.",2
4071,"It doesn't live up to the original for several reasons. There is a conversation between Anderson and his boss that clearly states why this movie was made and that, for me, gives 100% reasoning behind why this movie is what it is. There is a lot of rehash here but it is handled cleverly and given the story it's not pointless. It's also necessary to remember that this was filmed during COVID which I assume changed quite a bit of how filming went. The age of Reeves and Moss along with covid is a valid reason why the fight scenes weren't on par with the original. The film did drag a little in the middle as this is a very dialogue heavy film which also separates it from the original. Certainly don't go into this thinking it is going to be as groundbreaking as the original, it is not, but as I said the reason for this movie being made is integral to what you see on screen.",6
4072,"I just loved the film, it came totally different of the others, bringing back more self analysis, mind blowing and spiritual experiences to me. I believe the goal of the meta language experience tried to make sone people have the red pill watching, but just the awakened or semi awakened people get that. The general public and some fans were just waiting phenomenal and new special effects like the others maybe. In my case the movie was almost bringing me back to the doors opened when I had experienced ayahuasca and deep meditations. Well done again and I need to watch more and more.",10
4073,"With not many movies to choose from these days, I went into this not really following the first few, which came out when I was a young teen, so expectations weren't really too high: I must say, it's a little all over the place, but never bored me. Kept me intrigued from start to finish and the storytelling was plentiful. The visuals of course were beautiful and the sound mix was done perfectly. All in all, it was some nice nostalgia to venture back to and for the story to be finished all these years later. I guess I can appreciate it more now being in my 30's lol was definitely worth a watch. Pretty good action movie, so I can't understand the harsh ratings. People overthink and analyze movies too much these days. Just let loose abs enjoy you cynical a holes lol.",8
4074,After watching the matrix revolutions two times and rewatching matrix 1 and 3 I realize the movie is a big setup for another sequel. I guess this is like a setup for another trilogy more like episode 7.I was disappointed Hugo Weaving did not return as agent Smith at first but after further analysis I realize agent Smith can be anybody and can choose any appearance.I think the movie is good if we just admit its not as good the first matrix. This movie will add more points to the legacy of the matrix.,8
4075,"I tried to love it, and I laughed once or twice. NPH is good, but.... I don't know what I just saw. Worst one yet. I'd be pissed if I bought a movie ticket for this.",5
4076,"As most teenagers growing up in the 90's, i was a major fan of the Matrix trilogy. The concept was fresh, the action scènes where at that time from another level ( especially the highway scène in Reloaded) and the fight scènes where(from a martial artist point of view)enjoyable to watch. I became a big fan and was very dissapointed when the series ended in 2003. 18 years later, joy oh joy, a reboot! I was instantly plugged right back into the Matrix. Finally i watched the movie, and as i struggled trough the first part of it( with some exceptions) i became more and more weary of the fact that i was not what i had hoped for. I had a different Morpheus and Smith still loaded in my brain, and i found it very hard to get acustomed to the new Morpheus and Smith. I think i speak for most fans as i say that the fight scènes from Neo are very clumsy looking this time. And we know that Keanu can do some nice Wing Chun and Krav Maga, hence John Wick. Overall i found the fight scènes not that good at all. I guess that we have another trilogy on our hands, and i hope that the build up of the action will evolve the same as the first trilogy. ( Reloaded had by my opinion the best and spectaculair action scènes).",
4077,"Some of the new characters are worthy additions to the series - I'm thinking about the Analyst in particular, since he was so smug that I wanted to hit him, but also Bugs and the re-worked Morpheus are good.A couple of the inside jokes were actually funny, like the naming of the cat and Berg being a Neo-logist.The collective suicide of the bots was creepy as hell.Overall, the runtime could have been shortened to two hours, but we left the theatre without the sour taste of chapters 2 and 3.",7
4078,"I don't usually write a review for a movie but I had to do it for this movie, I think this movie should be rated 8-9, It was great, amazing and it had great scenes, watch it.",10
4079,"This movie felt like it was trying to be an MCU movie with the lighter tone, but overall it was a failure to me.Poor filmmaking fundamentals (as an example, the shaky camera scenes where they try to make the characters look disoriented were laughable), unsubtle writing (a cat called de ja vu? Looool), jokes that never land, and just overall....a straange and implausible plot.This felt disrespectful to the previous series, on top of some scenes where they actually are disrespectful (they throw in some scenes where one of the characters pokes fun at how the original blue and red pill scene with Laurence Fishburne was slightly dramatic - you don't get to do that if you don't actually bring anything positive to the table)Nothing but a cash grab. Avoid this and you'll avoid spoiling a beautiful memory.",1
4080,"If you're a fan of Reloaded and Revolutions, you'll likely enjoy where the plot goes next.The answers you wanted to know about what happened to Neo after he fought Smith, and how Trinity survived as well, and what happened to Morpheus are revealed.People keep comparing it to the original first Matrix, as they keep expecting some sort of huge plot twist. I really don't know why that would make sense story progression wise, having some sort of mind bending plot twist like the original. It really doesn't follow nor serve any purpose to the story.Like are we supposed to have aliens come down and attack the machines and now there are aliens, human and machines fighting one another? Is the machine city another matrix people are in, and Neo is living a simulated dystopian reality to test out some prototype VR for a company for 2-4 years, being asleep, then he wakes up to find out none of it is real, and that humanity is actually in present day, and everything is fine?People have really low IQs when it comes to understanding story telling.That said, there was some mention that this was sort of like the Last Jedi.I disagree, Trinity isn't some Mary Sue, and she's always been the key to Neo having his powers, especially when she brought him back from death in the original first movie. And it's not like they totally nerfed Neo, he still is just rebuilding his powers.This story continues Sati's journey and tells what happens to her parents, and continues the theme of love and connection, which Sati's father talks about in Revolutions, and also Neo's connection to Trinity and if it would survive their torture by the Machines.I like where the story went in regards to sentients programs wanting freedom as much as some humans, and how much the world outside of the Matrix had evolved as well.The chemistry of the new crew of the Mnemosyne was palatable as well, and it was enjoyable to see Niobe become like Locke, but knowing she was wrong as well, and reversing her position later on.People who didn't enjoy the humor in this movie, obviously didn't enjoy the humor in the previous trilogy, as the humor in this current iteration is just a natural evolution of the previous 3 films, and Thomas is still Thomas, until he remembers he is also Neo, and even then, Neo is funny because he got a bit nerfed, and couldn't fly, not until later. People need to remember that Thomas is NEO. Just because he got freed from the Matrix doesn't mean he still doesn't have Thomas' natural reaction to things, Neo is just Thomas evolving and realizing how the world actually is, but it doesn't mean it has to make him lack a sense of humor or be able to display goofiness here and there.Anyways, if you enjoy fight scenes, better graphics, and a continuing of the story in a sensible manner and the world building of the previous 3 films, you'll enjoy this 4th movie/reboot, which I want to see a sequel to Resurrections.People need to lighten up on this movie. Seriously.It's funny how people ***SPOILERS for No Way Home***Loved how Tobey came back in NWH, screaming in thunderous applause, but forgot that cornball humor in Spiderman 3, when he had Venom attached to him, and somehow feel they couldn't take Tobey seriously after that, but loved that he made an appearance in NWH. Now they want to bash Resurrections. You guys are some cornball snakes that can't enjoy movies or stories, and need some crazy mind bending twist just for the sake of twists, like that jacka55 director M Night whatever his last name is, or moron Rian Johnson with his Mary Sue garbage, wanting to kill of every character that mattered.",8
4081,"Okay, if you think yourself a huge fan for The Matrix, so you may missed that I'm the hugest fan.I just saw the movie an hours ago and it was incredibleI could say that The Matrix is my best movies series, I'm keeping this opinion from years, and maybe it will still like that until I'm dead.The movies was nostalgic in way I just can't describe, everything just made me remember The first parts specially the first one, I thought about all the possibilities for this movie, I told myself maybe it's gonna be that type of movies that is just made to get some money, but it didn't sound like.Like I said it was too nostalgic and the story really works with the earlier parts, but I hated that agent Smith isn't here!! How could one of the main characters of the movies just disappear, and I mean the presence of agent Smith by the Actor Hugo Weaving!!But I'm just glad that I watched the movies that I waited for it for years and I'm glad that the movie was great and didn't let me down, the ending was pretty close to the ending of the first part in 1999, I just saw Neo and Trinity flying and I remembered the ending of the first Movie When Neo wore his sunglasses and just flied away, ahh this ending still stuck in my head and it's one of the greatest endings ever, maybe better than a whole movies.So at the end you must watch the earlier parts to understand this one and I think that that's obvious, I know that not everybody gonna like it, but it'll be amazing for specially The Matrix fans, The movie is amazing in general, one of the best hours I spent in my life.",10
4082,"I myself am I fan of the matrix sequels. The Matrix is one of if not my favorite movie made, reloaded I think is a excellent sequel, although it drags a bit at the end of the first act and beginning of second, and I think revolutions is alright, just poorly paced. I tempered my expectations for a fourth film, knowing it couldn't set the world on fire like the first, but just hoping it was like reloaded or even revolutions tier. The story is good... enough, it isn't bad by any means, but it could definitely be better. The writing was definitely hit or miss, but I think all the actors involved play their roles relatively well. The cinematography however, is putrid. It is absolutely awful. The fight scenes, once grand spectacles, shot from afar to take in the grand scale of the action are these up close quick cut, crappy mid 2000's action movie fight scenes. Even the plastic looking cgi from the sequels is much more desirable than whatever this is. Gone are the days of bill pope, and if they do go forward with another trilogy, I hope they learn from their mistakes or return to bill pope. It's not the movie I wanted it to be, and I'm still a little disappointed, but overall it's not too bad of a fourth movie in a dormant franchise.",6
4083,"I was a real fan of the trilogy and wanted to disagree with the bad reviews for this one. The film started well but the cinematography ruined it. It needed to feel like the matrix and it didn't. It felt like a cheap version. The story could have been good, but it wasn't well executed, particularly the second half. We didn't see enough of Carrie-Ann Moss or Keanu Reeves, both of whom are great together. I feel a bit robbed in all honesty. Not for me.",6
4084,"First 20 minutes: Why is this movie bashing its original and sequels under the guise of a game? Its trying to be charicature that it didnt have to be. Its pointing out things that made people think about our existence in a Descartian way...but mashes it all in ""game idea pitch meeting sessions"".First 1.30 minutes: Basically its a copy of the 1st half of the 1st movie, but muuuuuuuch slower. If the 1st one had a quick and dirty explanation and an action scene, this one needed a narration for every scene.Last part of the movie: Sequels were useless, everything that Neo did is undone. There is a new Matrix boss and everything is bad.I just couldnt stand it anymore. Morpheus!!???Why did he have to be a comedic relief? Terrible direction of this great stoic of a character is now shown as someone who is drinking martini and doing KungFu right after. Its terrible..and a sad. Sad and unnecessary Rebouquel that was seen coming. Especially after watching the rest of Wachowskis' movies since the original Matrix.",6
4085,"In my opinion, the BIGGEST surprise of this entire year.I did not expect to be so incredibly invested and satisfied with the end result of The Matrix Resurrections.Sure, the film has its duds....but what film doesn't?This film is not only a respectful product of its predecessors, it's also quite the exuberant, satirical, and rejuvenating entry for stories and characters we've grown to love.Thank you, Lana Wachowski.",8
4086,"With a universe that has so much potential, and from creators who have shown us the pinnacle of that genre in the first movie, there is much here to confuse this exercise with the Star Wars prequels.Generic spoilers are better than specific ones, so the first hour was a tribute to melancholic reminiscence.Constant flashbacks to the original movie scenes and characters, all trying to give credibility to a linked storyline.It is mentally dragging. And the acting borders on condescending.Only after this punishment do you start to see some evolution of storyline, but the pretext is all a bit mushy and emotional (and loose in logic) and not the science fiction that made the matrix universe.Throw in a big plot steal from Monsters Inc, and you end up with a poor addition to what had the potential to be a franchise that could have been bigger than Star Wars, John Wick and James Bond combined.Perhaps some Indy filmmakers can take this universe and create something that truly blows our mind, and doesn't just try to resurrect our original emotional links to Neo and Trinity.",3
4087,"After 20 years and that's the only idea they came wirh?Terrible story, terrible script, the story line is weak.Come on!!!! It's the matrix!!!! So much to explore.",5
4088,"I was a bit high and Yh it made me rethink what we know as reality, maybe we are in 1byte of a matrix in a very large body that constitutes other matrices (eg, imagine each cell in a human body is another entire galaxy or reality) hell just see it 😂",8
4089,"First review. Seriously, please don't watch if you're a big matrix fan. Or honestly, even if you aren't.There were times in the movie where it literally seemed like a parody. Like you're being punked. It seems like it was written and shot as some cheesy tv action show with bad attempts at humor. Not even remotely similar to the others in any way. Please just save yourself the time and don't let this movie ruin the original trilogy for you.I'm going to do my best to forget this even exists.",1
4090,After several years actually it is a huge fun to watch new Matrix. I am really a big fan of Matrix 1 and new movie is worse than 1st but first one is extremely excellent 😬. But new one is Better than 2nd and 3rd.So I love it.,10
4091,"There are some good, cool ideas on story and visual scenes with actions but nope! This mostly was like a ''Thank you'' Anime-Music-Video for fans for sake of greatness of Matrix 1.The acting was horrible. Some designs, characters and CGIs were laughable and story sadly didn't tick.The only good thing this movie provided was the character: BUGS. Best scenes were her, best acting was her, interesting story was..still her.Voiceovers were annoying. They are in crowd but they didn't even care to add some crowd sound effect, i guess they were too busy on making that CGI bug which had like worse tech than 20 years ago.The music was NEVERENDING ''Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba'' if you call it music. And the credit music was just some matrix fangirl singing in a Japanese KARAOKE cafe.This movie is an INSULT to the original. For the first time ever, i don't want to rewatch a Matrix movie.And the prophecy ends here.",6
4092,"Depending on your perspective, you have to watch the film multiples time to put yourself in the character's shoes and grasp the deeper meaning of the filmThe movie is a reflection of our modern times and for those waiting to be enlightened.",10
4093,Carbon copy/facsimile of the first and original Matrix but with old people. Kudos to Keanu and Carrie for shaving their hair off for a pay check. It did make me laugh out loud on multiple occasions. Which was nice.,5
4094,"Lana Wachowski has successfully imploded the franchise - and has done so while giving the public and the industry (including WB itself) a painful slap on the face.The film delivers all the fan service, but with a very unsettling sarcasm. For every classic Matrix reference, we feel like Lana is laughing and pointing at us.She has also blocked most of the possible conflicts that would call for a reasonable sequel. Now machines and humans leave peacefully in harmony. AND Neo is not as powerful. AND Smith is just ""happy"" where he is. AND Trinity is now the protagonist. AND she can change the Matrix at the snap of her fingers. Seriously Warner, good luck trying to sell a possible sequel.I have already seen films that go against their own nature, almost as a manifesto, but usually they are small budget, B films. That's the first time someone does it with a gigantic franchise. At the end, we just have to give it up for Lana. Well played.",10
4095,I really enjoyed watching this film in cinema I'm a big fan of the originals I loved the choices this movie made if some of them didn't make too much sense but I enjoyed it neither the less although it didn't match the original. I do respect the opinions of others who don't like it and don't think the film is for everyone.,7
4096,"There are a few cool new technologies shown but no extra world building done. Instead there are some concepts from the first few that didn't really make the cut here at all, so they were ignored. It's characters you like having meek adventures, so it's entertaining enough. Meh.They just decided to make another Matrix movie without digging in any more than they already had. So I'm left feeling like every Matrix movie is a bit worse than the one that came before.",6
4097,"I liked it a lot. It can never impress me like whan I saw the first Matrix, but it has a lot of philosophical insights, interesting storylines and beautiful scenes. The themes of the illusions of life, free will, choice and destiny and love are explored once again in a convincing way.",9
4098,"The Matrix Resurrections wasn't bad.As always, good VFX, but the fights in the OG trilogy are better for sure. (They tried to stick as much as they could to the OG fights, but not quite there)Storywise wasn't bad either, but there are not few things which could have been more refined.Liked the new characters introduced to us as well how they managed to explain why some are not the same.",7
4099,"This one is about ""The Matrix - Resurrections"", I had to revisit the franchise to get the strike of what was made previously and I was to be prepared for this movie. One of the good decisions I have made in recent times of revisiting the franchise. Got hold of what the mainstream of the movie has entered the theatre with a lot of excitement. Many might not be fond of this franchise, but a person like me who grew watching Hollywood dubbed movies in the ""SUN and STAR VIJAY"" network definitely will have the nostalgic feel. Then the movie starts and within 30 mins Patrick Harris convinced me this isn't real and then the action starts. Loved it. That matrix swag when they arrive with coolers gives an ultimate feel. Smith's take-over on analyst and Neo - Trinity are epic.",6
4100,"I guess it take a lot of effort to make such a bad movie, so bad it hurts to watch. A parody of The Matrix. I wish I could just wipe it out of my memories. I really had too high expectations, but the end result is just hilarious. Even Keanu's and Keri's acting were laughable. The new Smith was pure nonsense, the scene with the Merovingian was garbage. At this point I even doubt Wachowski's are behind the original story, which is pure masterpiece.Plot: 0Fight scenes and choreography: 0Music: 0.",1
4101,This movie is good if you see past an awful beginning of the scene where Neo meets trinity in the bike garage. The ending is also very bad since it's not a cliff hanger despite the movie being 2 and a half hours and it feels like they just wanted to have open arms to different future paths for the franchise.,5
4102,"Maybe all the bad reviews come from sentients who don't wan't us to see how good the movie really isIt really pushes the envelope and makes us all remember the doubt of our current reality (Pandemic anyone?)Enjoy it, it will give you back the original mojo of the first movie thru some nostalgia and a new perspective.",8
4103,"Everyone has your own mind prison, your own Matrix. If you stay in this prison, you won't enjoy your life as you should. To me, ultimately that's the message of this movie. It has its problems, sometimes it drags a little bit, for example. However, the concept of the movie, the upgrade in the Matrix and how it reflects the ever changing world we have today, is incredible. I think I've never a movie as sincere and metalinguistic as this one. All external conflits and controversies were brought into the core of this story. More than a rich subtext, the movie also delivers a great development of the Matrix franchise myths and a well development of the two protagonists.",9
4104,"I can understand that many people are disappointed. I know many people expect big and expensive blockbuster Action like in Bad Boys or Die hard. But this movie continues the story of matrix in a good way. The film tells the story on a meta level with a lot of humor. Unfortunately, most of them don't understand this, they just want dull, fat action.But its not the fault of the movie. Watch some stupid blickbuster and don't complain. The most critics from magazines are good. Because they understand it.",8
4105,"It is Meta as hell, but then I think this was kind of the point. In 1999 the question was centered around this new wave of technology coming, and if we were supposed to trust it or question it. Fast forward to 2021, and that battle is over, we lost, technology is pervasive in every square inch of our lives, there is no true shock factor left in anything.Through that prism, I actually felt as though the film was doing the same thing today it was doing in 1999 from a thinking standpoint. By that measure, from a conversational, contemplative and thought provoking standpoint, I give it a total and complete tick.Can any franchise claim to be able to converse in such a reflective and intelligent way as this franchise about a question as profound as ""what is reality?"". This film certainly does a better job of this than the 2nd and 3rd films did.The film is however two films, first being an essay type commentary on todays society, the second being a love story, and a relatively good one. While the latter is certainly the weaker part of the film, I felt as though the history between the primary characters was such that it still resonated with me. It also provided a grounding back bone to what is in large parts a sort of existential think tank going on for most of the film.Overall I enjoyed it, its not perfect but its certainly better in my view than I feel some of these reviews are attempting to say it is.",8
4106,"After watching this movie and paying $20 to see at iMax, I will never watch another movie that has Lana in the credits. This movie was pure recycled garbage. You spend half the movie watching Neo having a nervous breakdown and the other half watching scenes direct from the previous 3 Matrix movies. The new Morphius was a flamboyant clown, and I am sure Laurence Fishburne was thankful he was not asked to play the role in this movie. I do have to give Keanu Reeves credit for his role in this pile of dung, but the rest of the acting was on par with a group of school kids.",1
4107,"The Matrix Resurrections is a lot like the boxer who, decades after passing his peak, decides to step back into the ring again. A bit slower in the joints, but there's also a clarity and determination that only time can provide. After the first Matrix film was released in 1999 two sequels were rushed into production. Reloaded did a decent job at expanding on the first film, but the third ran into the dual problem of having exhausted the premise while also needing the bring the whole thing to a close. Now more than 20 years later director Lana Wachowski (flying solo) brings many of the principles back into this world. And like them this Matrix is a bit more world-weary, a bit more reflective of the miles everyone has put on.The how's and why's of the movie are buried in spoiler territory and add some mystery since, at the end of Revolutions, Neo and Trinity (Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss respectively) were dead, peace had been brokered between the machines and human survivors, and the Matrix itself was coming to an end. But here we meet an older Thomas Anderson, a mentally unbalanced celebrity game designer whose fame has come from a video series that basically encapsulates the first three films. Meta? Oh, hell yes. There's little doubt that The Matrix Resurrections represents both the joys and the frustrations Wachowski has felt about her opus over the years. Probably one of the movie's most insightful moments is a planning section for a proposed sequel to The Matrix (the in-movie game) where people try to cook up marketing-friendly takes on why the original was so groundbreaking.Where Resurrections goes from there is, as stated before, in the realm of spoilers, but this IS a Matrix movie and for the first time since the original actually returns to its source and lets some new ideas take root and bloom. Where the second and third films seemed saddled by the burden of providing ever larger and louder set-pieces, the action here feels like a secondary consideration. In fact, my main drawback of the film is that the action scenes, particularly the fight choreography, is a step back from the pristine sheen of the trilogy. How big of a problem is this? Depends- if you saw The Matrix as an action series, it'll be a pretty big one. If you saw it as a novel science fiction story you're far more likely to be on Resurrections' wavelength. This is more sobering than slick, particularly near the climax when the movie edges as close as the series has ever come to horror.Overall, The Matrix Resurrections is not an easy recommend because it's not an easy movie to categorize. You have to give Lana Wachowski credit for not taking the Force Awakens path of a revival that is high on nostalgia and fan service while also being inarguably a bit vanilla. It's a movie that is going to inspire a lot of love and hate, but most of all a lot of discussion between the two, and if that isn't an ironic duality that the makers of The Matrix can appreciate, I don't know what is.",9
4108,"This movie depressed me...and not in a good way. By that I mean, it tried to be a cautionary tale, but lacked all cinematic value and storytelling of the original trilogy. Though, the first one was the best, and the series saw a gradual decline since that film, the were still worth watching and added to the series in some way. The third film in the series was very cliché, however, it was still watchable, with characters that one could empathize with.This film was like a bad SNL skit that sought to parody the original Matrix film. It was self-deprecating, and it was clear that the writers were trying to tell the audience that they were self-aware. But, as it went on, the same joke got tired and stale, demonstrating that the writers were not self-aware at all, and rather, quite self-indulgent. Hence, it is like a bad SNL sketch, wherein the audience is letting out pitiful chortles because of the painful sympathy they feel for the cast members, dying to be entertaining, but miserably failing. Though, this is not my biggest critique.The hidden villain was not hidden at all. I was not a fan of Neil Patrick Harris' character. The red/blue motif was so saturated throughout the film and on his character that, when he was first introduced, he may as well have been screaming, ""I AM THE VILLAIN!"" Doing this with the red/blue motif, saturating it in every corner of the movie, caused it to lose all meaning. I really wanted to like this film, because of how it adapted to modern issues, the jab at psychopharmaceutical companies (I do take an SSRI and it actually helps a lot, ironically, it is a blue pill), the implication that people have lost interest in trying to find the truth, and how they'd rather have it spoon-fed to them. There was messaging in there that I liked. But none of it was executed well. Nothing was given to the viewer through character action or storytelling, it was all dialogue. There were people on screen telling the viewer what they wanted us to get from the movie. Spoon-feeding. Doing exactly what they said is a modern human weakness. The original Matrix movie allowed for analysis and viewer interpretation, this one just shoved it down our throats, just like a little blue pill.Not to mention, the replacement of Laurence Fishburne by another bald black man. I know white people have a hard time telling black people apart, but come on, I'm not THAT white. I know he is old now, and may not have been able to handle doing the movie, but maybe that was a sign that they just should not have done it. Make a different one, make a new, original film! I admire the Wachowski Sisters for their previous work on the other Matrix movies, I know they have the ability to come up with a new story, especially for how wacky and REVOLUTIONARY the original Matrix was.I had only just seen the original trilogy of The Matrix, as I am a youngster, so it's not like I am so attached to the past that I can't accept a newfangled adaptation of something older. It's just that this film lacked the quality, depth, and god forbid, the CHARM of the original movies. Sure, they want to show off the new special effects that have developed over the years, but something so crisp and clean does not feel like The Matrix. Not to mention the forced romance between Neo and Trinity. It used to be natural, boring to me, but that's just my personal opinion on hetero romances in general. It's like the eight and ninth seasons of The Office, when Jim and Pam were happily married, and the writers started forcing conflict. Then they tried that whole thing with Andy, Erin, and Pete, echoing what they once had with Jim, Pam, and Roy. It did not work at that point. That's what they tried to do here with Neo and Trinity.I know this review is quite long-winded and disorganized, and I doubt anyone will make it through reading the whole thing, but I just had to get my thoughts out. This movie did not feel like The Matrix at all, hence the title of this review. Additionally, the title comes from the fact that the messaging was not embedded at all through storytelling, but the writers tried to convince me otherwise. I am aware that critique is meant for the consumer and not the creator, but these this is probably something they should hear. For the writers: don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining.",5
4109,They make this movie to go for the fans and have a litle more money.Should stay with just one movie. The first one.Don't even deserve the time to go from home to the theatre.,3
4110,"Okay, i just watched it a second time and bumped this to an 8. You gotta ask yourself going in to this...is there any possible way it can ever bring back high of the original Matrix? Of course not. At this point its like going to see an aging rock band touring for a new album. They may have some good new stuff, but its their old songs that brought you there. And you want to be taken back in time to relive and remember those days.Thats kinda what this movie is. Its actually pretty smartly taking you back. In some ways almost tongue in cheek. At the same time, it builds on the original in a meaningful way.. its not preachy like 2 and 3. This movie took itself far less serious and was moree fun overall.Bugs is probably my favorite character. Her role was better than Neo or Trinity. New Morpheus was pretty cool too. They probably should have just named him something else to avoid the confusion. I get the point now, but it adds to the confusion. I think a spinoff matrix series with Bugs and new Morpheus would be cool. Like Mandalorian cool in a way the last star wars trilogy wasnt.Smith was mostly pointless. I get why he was coded to look differently, but not sure why he was brought back at all. Hes against Neo, then hes for Neo. Then hes like ""peace out bitches"" and is just gone. Mirovingian was absolutely pointless. Just comic releif via annoying French obscenities.The zombie swarm mode was cool. It would have been much better if there were any fight moves beside running around in circles on the ceiling and walls.Speaking of fights ...the fighting was weak sauce. This was definitely not Wu Ping original Matrix action. Very stiff western fighting with a lot of hard punches breaking things. It just wasnt all that special. Keanu seemed stiff. I guess hes getting old and it shows.The whole ""look at me, i can stop bullets"" thing got really boring. Way overused. Mqybe he should get shot, absorb them, then crap them out for effect.Overall its worth watching though. That it is fun, brings back good memories, makes new potential lore, and actually doesnt ruin the premise of the first ones is a win for wakowski.",8
4111,I'm so glad I watched this streaming instead of spending a small fortune at the theater. I kept waiting for something to happen and then I kept pressing the pause button to see how much longer until it would be over.,5
4112,"Dialogues with little meaning, translation into Spanish, very bad.The story seems like a Disney story.While the special effects are well done, the plot of the film is childish, predictable, and nothing surprising.For my part, I do NOT recommend it.",3
4113,It is funny to see the makers of this movie once again show how people live in a false sense of reality. A great allegory for life today. Keep pretending you're something you're not. It's not real. Great job Wachowski ..............?,8
4114,"I was kinda hoping this wouldnt be a making the movie just because you can deal, but here we are. I was looking at how much was left at the 20 minute mark and horrified that it was a 2 and a half hour flick. This is NOT a movie Im going to be watching twice. Pretty disappointed that Reeves went along with this but he did the last Bill and Ted flick and that was a bomb. Some movies should just be left alone so many years later.",6
4115,"I only saw the Original Matrix in March, of 1999... never watching any of the other, Matrix franchise movies. The Original Matrix was perfection, for me at the time. I couldn't have imagined how they could've made such flawlessness into a franchise~ so, I stepped away. However, I felt compelled ~ pulled back into the Matrix world with Resurrections~After 23 years for me, as it is in the movie, it was a Deja Vu, A Remembrance, A Hat Full of Many Trix and A Second Chance at... take your pick, from the many Trix within the Matrix~ I chose to see; A Great Love Story, The Essence~of People That Can Help Push Us To Be Our Best Selves...and Our Stories Are Malleable. Therefore, We Can Create Our Own Stories The Way We Want Them To Be... Not Manipulated by the Tinkle of A Be! )I had no Expectations, before watching this movie... just a compulsion to see where this was going all these years later... It did Resurrect, for me my memory, of the Original and it's purpose was propelled beautifully forward in this movie. To see Keanu, ( he's 2 months older than me! I'm female! ) was well, Great~ Especially, when he is remembering who He Really Is!! I mean We All Want To Remember Who We Really Are, Don't We!!",10
4116,I'm a big fan of the Matrix trilogy(in descending order of enjoyment of course) so when I say I enjoyed almost nothing about this movie it's a big statement. The storyline and writing is terrible. The cinematics feel like daytime television. If you're a fan like I am then do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.,2
4117,Well written 'get around' the death of Neo and Trinity. There we some funny moments and lots of DeJaVous! Action sequences were not as good as the original but generally a very good film.,8
4118,"I gave this a 10 out of 10.If you have ever gone down any rabbit holes in the last two years, you'll appreciate every single phrase used in this movie that could easily trigger other people who are still asleep.It takes an open mind to fully understand some of the concepts in the movie. If you haven't been ""red pilled"" then this movie isn't for you.NPH plays a great Analyst in the movie. He definitely knew how to use those triggering phrases to satiate those of us who are already red pilled.The movie is fitting for men and women, with action and love. Go see it today!",10
4119,"This will be a non-spoiler review that will probably cater to neither the excessively negative nor the rapturously positive reviews of this movie, as among what I've seen online, there seem to really only be a lot of hyperbolic opinions on this film in the context of the full series in the same way The Last Jedi had.The first 10-20 minutes of the film were slightly embarrassing with constant flash-cuts to previous films' already-iconic footage that felt less like an interesting twist on the existing narrative and more of your standard tentpole-studio member-berries-esque content that's meant to simply remind you of the feelings and emotions you have surrounding your nostalgia. The dialogue is bad in this opening, but not in the way the original trilogy's dialogue was bad: the original Matrix films had sickeningly sincere, but blunt dialogue, while this film's opening felt like a Joss Whedon script penned circa 2012 (""Oh Em Gee"", ""Doubleyou Tee Eff"", etc., the dialogue is juuuust out of date to not even be ironically funny in the way it was trying to be).*This is, to my understanding, completely intentional and works to reinforce the narrative of the film.* I'm pretty sure the first 20 minutes were an attempt to just reel in the general audience expecting The Matrix, but with newer special effects.In the film's second act, we quickly snap back to a much newer, much more interesting premise than we've been led to believe. The mention of The Last Jedi earlier was very intentional, as I was having flashbacks to the way that movie deconstructed the film's universe, and I suddenly thought less of that movie (I liked it at release) because this film really feels like Lana Wachowski had complete creative freedom from Warner Brothers, which is excellent to see.No, Morpheus is not played by Lawrence Fishburne, and no, Agent Smith is not played by Hugo Weaving, but without spoiling anything, there is a reason why these characters are played by different actors that is explained somehow both in-universe and on a metatextual level.The film plays with the metatextual nature of being a film reboot in a saturated market in a similar fashion to the video-game adaption for the PS2, The Matrix: The Path of Neo, which I definitely didn't expect going in. I went in just thinking this was going to be generic Hollywood reboot #492 to be tossed onto the pile, and certainly, the trailers would lead you to believe that.But, as the movie progressed, I grew out of my jaded hatred for most of what I was seeing in the first act and pulled back to look at the finished product- I don't really think there could've been a better Matrix sequel. All I can say to the naysayers of this film is: imagine handing this product to some normal, ""in"" screenwriter or director like Colin Trevorrow. You'd get some dreck about our main character having Neo as some type of father-figure and needing to retread the steps of the first film in the most boring, bland studio way possible. The film would get an 82% on Rotten Tomatoes, generally positive reviews, but let's be *really* candid here: nobody would remember it in 5 years.For better or for worse, this movie is its own beast separate from the other Matrix films, and for that reason, I enjoyed myself and I'm actually excited at the prospect of a potential sequel! That being said, it's not a masterpiece, there are many better movies out there to watch, but if you're looking for an interesting ride, you could definitely do worse than this one.",7
4120,"The movie brings a lot story wise, I went in expecting nothing new, and I got exactly that. But in a good way, on the big screen it look fantastic, there's enough action and beautyful scenes.It's also a giant FU to current hollywood and socialmedia culture.But because it brings a lot, it is with 2,5 hours maybe too short to actually go in depth. There are so many changes in the world, in and outside the Matrix which I would have wanted to see more explained.It's a must see, but don't expect a Neo = Superhero marvel movie.",7
4121,I really dont want to waste my time writing for this movieOne thing only for those who want to watch it on cinema.Just don't!!!!Thats not matrix. Its a mixture of different movies and also the half is parts of the previous movies. The fighting scenes are also destroyed and filled with poor edit and boring slow motion. We can even see the disappointment on the faces of the actorsI am just very disappointed because another great and loved franchise gets destroyed just because of money and nothing else. That happens a lot today and we can see that most of the movies are reboots of previous successful franchises.Sadly i have to say that i can clearly see the end of the road for the movie production.,3
4122,"Missed Morpheus, agent Smith the original ones. The new age setting of the matrix was too hard to swallow. None of the supporting characters made an impact except Priyanka Chopra and the analyst.Bugs did a fabulous job and I believe a lot more could have been done.",6
4123,"In the famous words of Michael Scott...NO GOD NOOOOO NO GOD!!! I am the biggest fan of the first matrix, even the second and third I found pretty awesome...but this was like taking a big dump on my childhood memories.",5
4124,"I enjoyed the film. It provided some nostaligia and an interesting story that was in line with the Matix story arc.SPOLIER ALERT . . . .At the end of the third movie. Neo is blinded and seriously injured in his pursuit to saving the world. Its the beginning of a new dawn. The whole Matrix story line is very much based on the christian myth. A chosen one (in this case a Cyber Jesus) that will redeem mankind.The fourth Matrix continues this story. In flashback we see that Neo had died but is brought back to life by the machines (i.e. Jesus raised from the dead and made whole by God). During this time, a new revision of the Matrix is created. Neo is placed in a limbo world created for him, the memory of the past feeling like a dream, believing his past visions are psychotic episodes. He has a beard and long hair (again symbolic of his role). The therapist he sees keeps him medicated with the blue pill. Trinity is also living in this world, given a different name and life.As the story continues, his disciples rescue him so he eventually comes to see the truth again. As in the christian myth it is a women who sees him first and tells the others. Once reawaken, Neo he must save Trinity, the love of his life.The story of the Matrix is that the machine intelligence know that in order for the virtual to exist, there has to be a Neo and a Trinity. They are seen as the elements required to ensure that each revision of the Matrix maintains some form of integrity and to keep the runaway programs in check. The truth is that the chosen one is actually not just one person, it is Neo, Trinity and the machine (God) (i.e. The holy trinity). They work in conjunction.At least thats how I see this story (and I'm not religious). It's not solely based on christian myth but also on a-lot of other religious mythology and philosophy. It's about the maintaining of balance. The virtual world cannot exist with just Neo or with just Trinity. It will be doomed to collapse. The machine intelligence knows this. The combination is more than just the individual parts.",8
4125,"Hugo Weaving is missed.Good performance from Keanu, Carrie; the girl with the white rabbit tattoo (Jessica Henwick) stole the show.Niobe, Merovingian could have been axed. Needed a tighter editing. So many cut scenes / callbacks to earlier series made it feel less powerful.Less is more sometimes.",5
4126,"Didn't Matrix Trilogy mean nothing to these brothers/sisters???Fine, change of plot, but no convincing explanation?Jesus Christ, you are so focused on filling the movie with your political agendas that you forgot there are millions of fans looking forward to Matrix 4?What a waste of money.Just go play Matrix Trilogy and time is better spent.Not sure if they are coming up with Matrix ""5"" but I'm not watching it. They've ruined it and they are not coming back. Pathetic.",3
4127,"After all the bad reviews I had to see for myself how this new matrix was and I mostly, even though it hurts, have to agree with the negativity its gotten. The acting, the FX, the characters were all good but the storyline was the problem. I felt there was no progress in this movie to move the story forward. It's just another one watch and done movie that Hollywood is throwing out.",5
4128,Feels like a budget made knock off made for tv special. Action scenes have lost all their style. Writing and direction was poor. I'm growing tired of established franchises relying on call backs and nostalgia to make new movies. I'm not interested in remixes. Music score is uninspired. Not even worth a morbid curiosity viewing.,4
4129,"Screams of creative freedom &amp; no studio tampering &amp; all the better for it. Those wanting more of the same will hate it. Those with as open a mind as Neo &amp; Trinity will love. Fresh, entertaining &amp; not as in your face nostalgic as reported. 10/10.",10
4130,"I love the Matrix movies. I love how they cause us to question our own reality and our ability (or sometimes lack thereof) to make choices for ourselves. I was so excited when I heard about this sequel and my mind started spinning with all of the different angles that the movie could go for. Would they reveal that Neo never actually got free, and what happened in the first three films was all still part of a simulation? Would they go the route of showing an origins story for The One? Or maybe the whole concept of the matrix lives within the mind of a troubled human being living in a world of rapidly expanding technology, and what we saw in the first three films was their inner narrative? Any of these would've been better than what the film turned out to be.If you were looking for a resolution to the Neo/Trinity relationship and wanted them to remain together forever, then I guess you got what you wanted. But if you were looking for originality and groundbreaking new ideas and perspectives, then I'm sad to say the movie simply does not deliver. It started out incredibly interesting and had me questioning - is Thomas Anderson truly crazy? Is this whole thing going to take place in the real world? Or are they really going to pull him back into the matrix? The first 20-30 minutes had me hooked. But after that...after they went down the familiar road...that's when they started to lose me.The things that bugged me the most were:1) The rushed explanations for profound changes (such as Morpheus suddenly being a machine and visibly younger, and the bots vs agents).2) The monologuing of the Analyst (unlike the Architect, he said a lot of nothing to me. At least what the Architect had to say in Revolutions was profound).3) The action sequences and general feel of the movie (it felt very small-scale. Even though the story surrounded Neo and Trinity, they could've been smarter with their action choices and even with the inclusion of Smith).4) This is the most frustrating...the lack of a compelling story. Like I said before, there were SO MANY different storylines they could've gone with that would've created a much deeper and moving story. I felt like the route they chose was one of two star-crossed lovers trying to get back to each other, and it just did not hold my attention. People wanted questions answered about the matrix, or at least for their minds to be blown away once again, and personally I felt like this was a snooze fest of a story. I walked away not caring about what happened, and that says something considering how much I love the original movies.Overall I will say that if you are a die-hard Matrix fan, then maybe go see it just to watch Neo and Trinity do their thing once more. But don't expect the originality, depth, complexity, or brilliance of the first three films. Take it as a standalone movie that can easily be done away with if necessary.",5
4131,"This is totally a different movie than the Matrix we know !The acting is awful, no story, no action same as the original matrix, nothing special on it.And the worst thing they used is the flash back scenes, terrible!!!!!I hope they never made this movie at all.",5
4132,I actually enjoyed the film although it was a little long with lots of re-hashed bits from the previous films.It definitely misses Laurence Fishburne's screen presence but the new Morpheus was still good.A decent enough film but did it really need to be made???,7
4133,"I went in the theater looking to be amazed. Unfortunately I was disappointed. In the first half of the movie we're left wondering if it was all a delusion or not, then back and forth again and again. What happened to Morpheus? We never find out. Why Smith again? Super Trinity? A lot of unanswered questions. They should have left well enough alone.",4
4134,"As I wrote this few lines, this movie stands at below 6.I don't get it why.Yes, it IS full of references of previous installments. Yes, it lacks the amount of action ""Matrix"" makes you imagine. And yes, some of the original cast were not present.But so what?I have just finished watching it. And although I didn't love it, I didn't hate it either.I learned that watching any movie rated below 6.3 (here on IMDb) will make you regret having wasted those hours of your life, but Matrix Ressurections is far from that.This movie could have been a special show. Something ""based on the Matrix original characters"" and people wouldn't have been so offended. Or could've helped them lower the expectations.",6
4135,"Seemed like when they were in the simulation, discussing the new matrix game, that WB we're going to create a new movie with or without the original creators. Could this be our actual reality? To me it seems likely that this was going to happen, and the watchowski decided to make it themselves instead of having it made without their input. I haven't looked into whether or not this is common knowledge, but didn't see it mentioned in the reviews here, so decided to write my first IMDb ""review"".My main criticism of this film is that a couple of the visual effects were dodgy, especially next to all the mostly excellent visuals. Namely when Morpheus has been freshly red-pilled.But my main main criticism is that Neo was so chill once he was freshly plucked out of the matrix, after being so mind-jacked by Doogie Howser, his psychologist, once extracted for me it did not ring true that he was just like, ""ah yeah cool, I wasn't crazy after all"". He would be in shock / traumatised for at least a little while... That's how the mind works in my experience.Other than that, I thought it was pretty cool, and not entirely the hot garbage I was expecting after seeing the reviews. I could go a fifth film in fact. A series would be rad too 🤷‍♂️",7
4136,This time of age noone respect source of anythink . This inclusion and paint everythink pink stuff started to annoy me .wtf did i watched. I opened this acc just to wrote this. If u are like me fan of matrix movies+anime and if u are doing every year matrix maraton dont even see this and destroy somethink u love. If u even see this movie 1 time they will make the money they want and it doesnt matter for them fans are happy or not but if we destroy them on box office and made them lose money this sh**t wil not happen agein hopefully......,1
4137,"Pointless sequel filled with flashbacks of previous films,more of the same action sequences and samey fights. Not much in the storyline etc.Of course Neo is not the ""one"" it had to be Trinity for the ""message"" of wokeness/feminism.Glad i never paid to watch this tripe.",3
4138,"Growing up with the original Matrix trilogy and I loved every minute of it! This was just a huge disappointment the only good thing about this movie was the fact that Keanu Reeves reprised his role! Half of this movie was clips from the original which we obviously loved, but if I wanted to watch the original Matrix I would just watch it at home. It has no originality and there was no actual plot to it. The first part of this movie was them stating how awesome the original trilogy was. The next half was them just trying to free trinity. Sad this ended up just being another cash grab. I honestly was hoping that at the end Neo and Trinity would just fall to theirs deaths so they wouldn't bother to make another trash movie.",4
4139,Meh.. a rehash of the same old. Should have left the matrix as the classic trilogy as it was. I did not like the lack of sound. Felt like I was listening to it underwater and for someone with sensory triggers this was infuriating. Had potential to be so much better.,4
4140,"I was scrolling through these harsh reviews and couldn't disagree more with all the hate. I was on the edge of my seat watching this one!! All the parallels to the original film as well as our world were done so smoothly. This was almost a love letter film to the first. The previous sequels are okay, but this is the sequel I've always wanted! It feels so current while sticking to the consistency with the first. Those who see will see...",9

4142,"This Matrix movie tells you all you need to know about the state of blockbuster franchises. Clearly the director was toying with the audience that yes, they were just going to reboot the franchise.Particularly in the beginning of the movie, it tells you through numerous characters that audiences are expecting it to be the same feeling as the original, but there are of course different interpretations of what the ""message"" of the first trilogy is. The director, of course, does not reveal the true message. This movie had to play it safe, in the climate of outrage towards recent blockbuster franchises which have received backlash for not delivering predictable storylines in line with older characters. We are in a time where audiences crave nostalgia above all else. References to past film events and even some memes being shoehorned in Trump any chances these blockbuster movies have of receiving plots that movie a series forward. And the director of Resurrections drivers the nostalgia in what feels like a snarky nod to the audience. People can be outraged about this installment all they want for being far too on the nose, but the director expects this outrage and is probably having a good laugh about it.I'll give this movie an above average score of 6/10 for having the guts to tell off the audiences that crave nostalgia above a good story. Nostalgia can of course be mixed with new stories (Cobra Kai is a perfect example of this.) But for some reason blockbuster franchises are being robbed this chance, in fear that the moviegoing public will be upset that their beloved franchise dares to turn a corner.",6
4143,"If you expect this movie to hold up on it's own, don't watch it or review it. If you've watched the previous 3, follow the story and the meaning you'll soon understand this movie continues the philosophy of control. Everything is explained with detail.

4144,Not gonna write a huge review only that this movie was the biggest waste of 2.5hrs that I'll never get back ! I only gave it one star because there's no option from zero ! Keane reeves Is the worst actor on the planet and I think he might be border line retarded? Avoid like the plague !!!,1
4145,"The Matrix Resurrections is an uninspired film that tries to be creative and revolutionary but is neither. At the end of the day it is a solid movie but makes you question what the need or purpose of the sequel is. This movie is only as good as the individual viewer thinks it is and I believe 10 different viewers will give you 10 entirely different reviews. A lot of the special effects are on par at best with previous installments and a lot of them are phoned in by modern day standards. This film fails when it tries to be like previous movies, because it doesn't do it enough. It also fails when it tries to be different, because it does so too much.The Matrix (1999) - 10/10The Matrix Reloaded (2003) - 9/10The Matrix Revolutions (2003) - 8/10The Matrix Resurrections (2021) - 8/10Above are my ratings for each movie here on IMDb.",8

I was not let down as I was taken on a story I could not predict as well as meeting new characters and old.If you got more of the same you would be disappointed, if you got something wacky - disappointed, so I truth, what were you expecting.Enjoy the ride and be glad the story was continued.Well done for having the guts to do this.",8
4148,"Besides some of the raging goofy moments in the movie (masks on the train? Lort...) it wasn't that bad. I grew up with the first 3. Trinity and Neo were great. Something was just lacking in the movie. Or maybe a lot of somethings. I did like Bugs character, but the scene in the apartment with Morpheus was super strange. Not well thought out. Also the old ladies in IO were horrible done. Just grab some old women, not middle aged women with aged makeup.I mean it could have been a lot better, but I guess it could have been a lot worse.",6
4149,From the beginning there was nothing to draw me in. Whole beginning was just exposition after exposition that was about movie that most of use have already seen. Worst part was philosophical conversations as there were too many of them and not hidden in regular conversations but was forced.I liked those little reflections that shows Neo for example sees himself as someone different than he really is but this just like everything else was plainly shown 5-10 minutes after initial scenes that left us guessing.Visually it looks great and I liked fight scenes as there weren't a lot of cuts made and Keanu Reeves clearly is prepared for things like these but replacement actors chosen are not that great. They would do fine independently but not as replacements as they lack charisma needed for it which made me feel like they are some random amateurs trying to imitate legends.Story was fine as they were left with little amount of choices as trilogy has ended things cleanly (left me with question as to why make movie at all)Overall this movie is meant to pay respects (and earn money ofc) to original and they did it quite well (as usually other remakes/sequels nowadays shit on originals). But as a movie it was below average.,4
4150,"Maybe it is because I've watched Matrix in 1999, being a 19-year-old teenager back then, who was watching the movie with zero expectations and no background info, which resulted in an absolutely awesome viewing experience. Everyone is aware of why the movie from 1999 was so great. It had:*) A really captivating story with a lot of suspense in the beginning and a stunning twist (welcome to the REAL world)*) Great cinematography with its film noir look, decent CGI and special effects, as well as innovations such as bullet time*) A great cast with great chemistry, every actor/actress fit in their role perfectly*) Villains with depth*) Good action with stunning fight scenes blending the martial arts with a futuristic hacker genre*) A killer soundtrackIt was a movie that was a candidate for numerous rewatches and substantial enough to philosophize about it.Then came the sequels - I watched part two in an IMAX cinema, it was somewhat OK-ish but compared to the greatness of the original movie a letdown, which is why I watched part three as a DVD rental. I've not even watched any of the sequels a second time despite I don't remember them being too bad.Now comes the latest installment in the series which starts a little bit with a Memberberries intro, but suggested the plot could develop interestingly. However it becomes quickly apparent that none of the aspects which made the 1999 movie great survived here.Captivating story? No, it's just a weird mess that in the middle of the movie is hard to comprehend and full of plot holes.Cinematography? I'm not an expert but I know there is something called color grading - the visual tone of a movie. But it's imperceptible how this movie has been graded - it's just a funky color splash. Maybe the director thought this would be appealing to the Instagram generation? Also, most of the scenes of the 1999 movie, despite the CGI is already dated, look much better and real than in the new one. Particularly the fight sequence on the train looks literally like a bad Marvel franchise green screen trainwreck.Great cast: the only good thing about the cast is Keanu Reeves, which is in theory still capable of delivering kick-ass action (see John Wick). Carrie-Ann Moss, despite having aged well and looking great, struck me as lacking enthusiasm/energy. The villains: while Neil Patrick Harris hasn't been miscast, it's a catastrophe what happened to the agent smith character both role-wise as well as actor-wise. That morpheus has been re-cast does not help either. The intentions of the villains are somewhat diffuse until shortly before the final scenes, and the characters are completely one-dimensional.Action: the action sequences are quite messy, with a lot of shaky camera, green screen lighting look, and partly unnecessary CGI. For example, when Neo is thrusted by Morpheus onto a wooden beam in a scene copying the Kung Fu dojo scene from the 1999 movie, the cracks in the wooden beam look like fake CGI, whereas in the original movie that would be a practical, real-looking effect. And again, there's all that funky colors everywhere.Soundtrack: I don't remember anything from it, it was just a generic score.Deservedly this movie calls itself ""Resurrections"", it's ambitious to reboot a franchise which was already going downhill due to its weak sequels, and thereby it's not surprising that the movie disappoints and is surely nothing I'd watch a second time.It's probably aimed at teenagers and tries to cash in on the Marvel movies formula, but if you grew up with the original movie, this will just make you feel old and sad.",5
4151,"I remember not much caring for Carrie-Anne Moss in the first three films. She has aged well, I found her more attractive now than 20 years ago, and she is a noticeably better actor now. Moss is what makes this film work at all; Reeves is still just very pretty cardboard, but only in the scenes without the gross jowly beard. Jada Pinkett was excellent and Jessica Henwick a lovely breath of fresh air. And it was cool to see Neil Patrick Harris playing very much against type. The effects are what we've come to expect from the series. The plot was very slow to build, but the last half hour was worth waiting for. I found myself laughing uncontrollably during one brief sequence about three quarters through that reminded me of a scene in ""Magnolia""(1999) by Paul Thomas Anderson, the one true Neo among screenwriters and directors, which brought to life the biblical plague of frogs falling from the sky for a new purpose.",6
4152,Doesn't hold a candle to the original. Seems like a low budget attempt to capture a classic. Would have preferred a reboot to this. The original characters just don't hold up. The special effects seem like a sad attempt to imitate the original but fall short. Worth watching as nostalgia trip but be prepared to disappointed.,5
4153,"Like the Star Wars sequels, here is another film that had the chance to expand the story and take me deeper in to the world. And like those, it failed completely and is laid bare for what it is ... a flagrant cash grab. What a shame.",4
4154,"Just saw it in IMAX. Exceptional film imo. Reached all levels of emotion. Poked fun at itself, and was a fantastic tip of the cap to the people who loved the original trilogy. This film is also sending a larger message about the increasing encroachment of unchecked capitalism. The ending left me nothing but wanting more. And dare I say, Neil Patrick Harris stole the show. People who have tunnel vision or only care for simple, and linear stories, might not get this film.",10
4155,"I was an avid fan of the first three movies. Bringing back the series required a unique story that not only setup a return but a promise of the future. This was that story. Complex, fulfilling, a mix of thought provoking concepts. This story brought the matrix of old back but updated for a whole new generation. I'm glad The story continues and I can't wait to see what the future holds.",9
4156,"History is repeating or maybe not. Neo (Keanu Reeves) returns to his Matrix character, programmer Thomas Anderson. His game, The Matrix, has become a sensation and he's working on the next edition, Matrix 4. He spots Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) in a coffee shop but she's a wife with two kids named Tiffany.This starts by repeating the original Matrix. I like it. I like the meta qualities. Mostly, it's good that Lana Wachowski figures out that this is about Neo and Trinity. The best scene has to be their meeting in the coffee shop. In a way, this is their meet-cute. Their relationship was never developed beyond being epic written in the stars type of formula. They are finally able to have a regular romantic scene. There is real energy when her husband walks in but it's a slow decline from that point on. NPH's reveal is oddly infuriating. He's doing a light comedic riff and he's far from computerized. The movie slowly drowns in its Matrix action and Matrix expositions. At some point, I'm lost with all the gobbledygook from the movie. It does maintain its focus on Neo and Trinity. That's something.",5
4157,"The movie it's not bad (excuse my English). You have to watch it at least 2 times before you have an opinion. If you don't remember the ending in Matrix Revolution, Trinity dies trying to take Neo to Machine City and Neo sacrifice himself to save human kind and defeat agent Smith. What did you expect in the next Matrix ? Watch it for 2 times and then pass judgment.",8
4158,"This movie is a waste of time with really bad acting. Apparently Keanu only got this far based on his good looks not his acting skill. John wick was great because he didn't speak at all, just action. The Matrix is a mess, terrible plot and lots of flashbacks to the previous ones. The dialogue is hard to understand which is good since it doesn't make any sense anyway.",1
4159,"It is natural to have high expectations when a new ""Matrix"" movie is released. The movie is shared between two worlds like it's predecessor. The ""real world"" and the ""matrix"" world. I found more interesting the ""real or the machine world"" where there are some new developments regarding the old movies. The plot in the matrix world is confusing. There are many gaps and many unnecessary scenes specially in the first part of the movie. There is not something we haven't previous see regarding the action but the action scenes are ok. Both of the good and the bad guys roles are forgettable and spiritless. There is not real thrill maybe because the stake is not as high as it was in the old movies. Reasons for someone to watch this movie are mainly out of curiosity and nostalgia. To watch again a couple of favorite actors in a matrix world and to see if an already revolutionary concept can bring something new. After all it's been almost 20 years since the last movie of the trilogy.",6
4160,"The 1st movie was an apocalypse for me. The script, the innovative action filming, the tone... All were exceptional. I wasn't thrilled with the sequels but I always rewatched them happily.When I saw the trailer for Resurrections I was so hyped. And a few days before going to the cinema I checked the IMDB page on a daily basis. A seven that became a 6 that became a 5.8. I was sure that I was headed to a disaster as I agree with the IMDB community 90% of the time. But it is the new Matrix movie of course I would have to see for myself. So I went holding a really small basket of expectations. Thankfully this was the 10% situation.This isn't so much a review about the film as it is an honest question to all those who voted less than a 7....Why?The nostalgia recipe was elegantly paired with the meta elements so both parts felt right. The storyline and plot were rock solid. Everything was explained in full detail, past and present. In a Matrix way that you have to see the movie again and again and pause to fully appreciate but that is a given with Lana being in charge. The actors both old and new did their jobs and no one felt out of place or irrelevant. The action scenes and choreography were also pleasing. And the critique on the Netflix culture and narrative being dead is right on so many levels.However, what really made me appreciate this movie is that it showed me what the Matrix movies are all about. It's not about the philosophy, the machines, the choices and the oppression.It's about love. It's about the unity between Neo and Trinity. It was ever present in the trilogy, but seeing how their bond transcends everything makes the Matrix quadralogy not only one of the best action movies of all time, but also one of the best love stories.I am truly baffled with the low ratings. I can understand if they come from people who haven't watched the previous movies or they didn't get into the ""trouble"" of rewatching them all. I really don't know what a person would understand or think if the have no knowledge or recollection of the trilogy.I myself on the other hand have no recollection as to life before the Matrix. It's just always been there. Like the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars were always there. There, to change my life and the way I view and appreciate movies.I guess like I stated in the title, some people are really stuck in the Matrix. I can't see any other explanation for rating this with lower than a 7.Unless of course we are in the Matrix and the bots are down voting so that no one knows the truth and escapes.Feed your head.",9
4161,This movie is not that bad. It could be way better but I still enjoyed the return of Neo and Trinity. The first movie will always be my favorite. With a good storyline their will be a 5th Matrix. A reality we're machines controle mankind is a well for endless storylines. After so many years it was so goed to see everyone back.,7
4162,A nice story back into the matrix but it turns into a confused story and after so many years and sequels already it seemed stale to me. I think I'd prefer to watch something original and fresh instead. RIP Matrix!,5
4163,"As many others have noted, this was a huge disappointment. The first 45 minutes are devoted to fanboyisms, self-references, etc. I shook my head in disbelief for most of the movie. There was probably 30 minutes of good action and original story line and the rest was flashbacks and crazy extrapolations of key characters, like the Merovingian. Mind you, I was in my early twenties when the first one came out. If you were born after the trilogy, perhaps you identify with this movie's style. I asked two young guys next to me in the theater what they thought. They gave me two emphatic thumbs up. I kept my opinions to myself at that point. Just like Coming 2 America and Frozen 2, this movie did not need to be made. It was a last minute cash grab. It ruined the lineage. This is not The Matrix 4. It's The Matrix: Selling Out.",1
4164,I am dissatisfied with the new matrix movie. It seems to be much less serious...much more like a pseudo-comedy with goofy characters and lines. Really don't like the style of this one at all.,5
4165,"If you are a fan of Wachovski's work and mind, don't listen to the bad reviews and enjoy the ride.It's beautiful and gives the true fans exactly what they needed. If you love Matrix, Cloud Atlas, Sense8... you will cry happy tears watching Resurrections.And if you watch it and feel the need to leave an awful review? I have nothing to say to you, enjoy your life in the pod.",10
4166,"Considering myself a big fan of matrix, I have to be dead honest, this is not as good as the other three, I've waited too much time and they come up with this? It makes me mad, there was a guy a couple rows back from me and he was literally snoring! But if you are a true fan you still need to watch it tho. And give you POV.",5
4167,"It is difficult to understand how and, most importantly, what to write about the new ""Matrix"", and what is better to keep silent about. For some, any word will be an unforgivable spoiler. For others, even the most verbose explanations will seem insufficient. Let's put it this way: both the most optimistic and the most gloomy forecasts came true.On the one hand, The Matrix: Resurrection is exemplary fan service for hardcore fans of the franchise who have explored every millimeter of this world, every second of films, animation and games over the past twenty years. She is such a post-post, such a meta-meta that you are amazed; the very first ten minutes are so filigree, obscenely carefully repeating the original ""Matrix"" of 1999, that they may not seem like a film, but a mocking art project of some contemporary artist. However, Lana Wachowski, who made the fourth ""Matrix"" without her sister Lilly (she left the cinema, for a while or forever - is unknown), such an artist is. For the uninitiated or those who had the audacity to forget the classic trilogy, it would seem that there is nothing to do here. At the same time, there is not even a hint of the revolutionary spirit that struck the whole world in 1999 and the shocking stylistic innovation in Resurrection either. The effect of bullet time has become boring and outdated, shell casings falling from a helicopter only make you shrug your shoulders tiredly, the audience has become accustomed even to authentic oriental kung fu players, against which Keanu Reeves inevitably fades. Yes, and he is not the same, only Carrie-Anne Moss, who played Trinity, has become even more beautiful over the years.On the other hand, the new ""Matrix"" only wants to be presented as a speculative repetition: behind a facade full of direct and veiled autoquotations, there is a completely different (even in terms of color palette - the haunting green has practically disappeared) film. And this is not a commercial nonsense created by the producers solely for the sake of earning money - moreover, there is a special joke on the subject of tortured sequels in the film.On the contrary, it is obvious that this is extremely personal, fundamentally very intimate for the creator of the film, which was made by Wachowski at the time of the crisis and in the hope of overcoming it, turning, in her own words, to the closest people - Neo and Trinity. Consider it a plus or a minus, but all the spectacular blockbuster scenes in the fourth Matrix are far less impressive than the static and low-budget ones; even the best of them, in which the main characters fight their way towards each other through a dense crowd of armed paratroopers, is not about saving humanity from ruthless machines, but about a man and a woman who decide to defy everything and stay together.",8
4168,"This Matrix movie is so damn confusing. Who's the good guy, who's the bad guy? What the hell is going on. I would imagine that it would be different if I was high or didn't expect good things out of these kinds of movies. It's like their trying to copy the fast and furious. This movie shouldn't have ever been made.",3
4169,"Haven't been more disappointed in a movie in a long time. Don't normally write reviews but I'm both depressed and triggered after seeing this mess. Lazy. Poorly written. Terribly executed. Difficult to watch. Bad storytelling. Could have been vastly improved with just thoughtful editing and a better music score. Dialogue was uninspired and not engaging. In the words of the new Morpheus ... blah blah blah ... he summed up the movie's dialogue well. Acting was sometimes poor and seemed inconsistent with the scene. It was just off at times. First part of the move Bugs had this low energy whisper mumble and I strained to understand what was being said. Too bad because I liked their character and the director could have fixed on the spot. Some CGI was substandard. Overuse of reused footage and of recreating scenes from the trilogy detracted from the story. Led me to believe it was used for content filler due to a lack of ideas and effort. Fight choreography and chase scenes were simply subpar for the Matrix franchise. Please ... it doesn't have to be groundbreaking like in Reloaded. We don't need to top Swarm of Smiths or the Freeway Chase ... but they should at least be memorable ... in the same league ... worthy of the franchise. Better cinematography would have helped here. Predictable gender and race-stereotyped villains along with the unoriginal and worn out heroes casting that could be from any movie in recent years. Overuse of the negative and demonizing us women being controlled by our male oppressors cliché detracted from a valid message. Criticism of Hollywood and movie reboots could have worked if done right but was simply cringe. Mentioning Warner Brothers by name in a world of mainly generic names except maybe referring to googling ... just weird. Lots of loose ends. SPOILERS: How did Trinity suddenly become able to fly? Why and how did Neo lose his ability to fly? Was it so nonsensical because it was just another way of uncomfortably forcing Trinity into being the heart of the story by making Neo inferior? Did we forget that in Revolutions Neo obtained superhuman abilities OUTSIDE of the virtual world of the Matrix!? That wasn't explained. At all. Did their actions at the end result in new war with the machines? How did their actions impact the human city ... you know, where the thousands of real life humans are trying to survive while the protagonists are being so cool off in their virtual world? What happened to the Merovingian? What was the point of including him? Lots of ??? And I'm all for a good love story. But this was a bit much and got old. Sometimes it was just ewww ... we get it. The machine-animals being petted? I have no words. It took a lot effort to find things that I liked. That worked. Like bringing Sati back and her new oracle-like role. I looked forward so much to this movie. But why? We've been disappointed before ... I guess I just thought that the Matrix was above all of that. I shouldn't feel let down. But I do. I feel sad and disappointed. The Matrix trilogy I know, despite its flaws, never made me feel this way. And it had lots of flaws ... I still cringe and shutter when I think of the orgy scene in Zion!? Oh gawd. This was also eye opening for me to see how the ratings systems and reviews work ... or don't. Makes me so sad to see how incredibly biased they are. The lack of credibility. It seems everything possible was done to keep this from being Rotten on a site I had always used to inform my decisions. After experiencing this move and attempting to reconcile with reviews I will approach with much more healthy skepticism going forward. And the critic's consensus!? No. Just no. It wasn't a good movie. I could see maybe 33% favorable reviews as a result of differing opinions and favorable reviews for supporting a reviewer's ideology or bias. In the end the stinger after the credits mirrored and summed up my feelings for the the movie very well. Why? Just ... why? It would have been much better if it just never happened.",3
4170,I liked the movie enough to give 6* but gave one more * to protest the disappointment by others. The movie was nicely put up. So many new concepts and it fits the original trilogy very well. It's a good setup for what's next to come. Looking forward to matrix 5.,7
4171,The overall look of the film is in perfect contrast to the first films. The color and lighting in each scene look amazing.The casting of the new crew seemed a little too young and clean looking.The fight and action sequences were creative and fun.An impressive work of art that I could only dream of creating.,8
4172,"Never been so disappointed with a movie I was so excited for. Woke attitude to it all hurts the original trilogy, but at least 'The One' is now female. Beggars belief with where they take Neo and Tiff with the after war story, should have just left them dead, at least they have robot mates now.Classically Neil Patrick Harris was able to play the role of Neil Patrick Harris. So many questions and all of them I don't want to hear the answers to, gutted is an understatement.Visually stunning though so there is that. The fight scenes were as to be expected and some of the driving and final fight sequence looked brilliant but by that point of the movie I didn't care. I thought to myself mid way through what is the point of this movie and my conclusion is there isn't one.",3
4173,And maybe you will be surprised.I finished it for old times sake... but except for a few familiar faces nothing that gave me that original Matrix feeling. Too bad.,5
4174,After the last two sequels I was ready for it to be meh. But I was surprised at how much I liked it. You could tell that it was infused with the alphabets but it didn't virtue signal or woke it up...that I could tell. It was well paced and full of cool aha moments and the flashbacks and the comparisons to our world were pretty great. Overall a good film.,9
4175,"Movie is good but is not Matrix. This is another movie. The Matrix was a movie that described the period beautifully (1999), thought-provoking, questionable and added ""Matrix philosophy"" to our lives. The acting was legendary, the dialogues were magnificent. This is the matrix love movie. The old Matrix universe has nothing to do with its philosophy.",5
4176,"Fun to see some flashbacks, but the action was boring. It kinda drags the original triology through the mud.. I still prefer the original 3 and god did i miss the real agent smith and morpheus.It was good to see for once. The ending doesn't do it for me.",5
4177,"Without giving away any spoilers I must say that I really enjoyed this film, but then again, I enjoyed the original trilogy very much. I was curious about how they would bring Neo and Trinity back after the events of Revolutions, and I was pleasantly surprised at how they explained it in-movie. One of the best things about the franchise is how it blurs the lines between what is real and what is just a construct, what is fate and what is choice. These dichotomies are on full display yet again, with a fresh take for new characters raised on the legend of Trinity &amp; Neo, all while they are being subjugated by a fresh version of the Matrix. I thought the story was perfect, the actors were great - most of whom are transplants from another Wachowski vehicle ""Sense8"" on Netflix (something I HIGHLY recommend everyone watch) - and the action was as you would expect from this franchise. There are numerous callbacks to the previous films, which I didn't feel detracted from this movie in any way; it felt like they were included with purpose, as Agent Smith would say, as a means to an end. Plus, in this day and age we love callbacks and Easter Eggs, do we not? Overall I was immersed in the story, and felt excitement that Resurrections was finally here, and it did not disappoint. But there are some things I didn't catch on the first viewing, so I'm off to watch it again. Pretty much par for the course for all the movies in this franchise.",10
4178,"We have been fully immersed in a certain form of simplistic 'wokism' over the last 10 years of TV/Cinema/Journalism/Literature/Social Media. There's really only 1 spoiler in this review. That the internet may well be our enemy. This film mocks each one of these forms of media intentionally. And, in the end, goes after a fair percentage of individuals when it throws around the term 'Sheeple'. A term that the internet doesn't take too kindly to. No form of entertainment or information supplier doesn't get skewered in some fashion here. Even an ad nauseum barrage of self referential attacks occur here (mostly early on in the film). It teeters on the edge of overdone in those aspects, but.... it never falls off the building. Never hits the ground, so to speak. If the concept of 'How we use the internet' of the first film was easy enough to grasp, then the 'How the internet uses us' concept of this film should not be difficult either. Though, it seems, many negative reviewers 'online' (irony alert) do not get that its' as much a Matrix continuity theme as can be possible in concept. It is the meta end-game idea of mind control through the tool of manipulation. Refining said manipulation to the point of totality. We are now doing it to ourselves. On point. People just hate having Alice's mirror put up into their own faces. They think of it as 'preachy'. Well, sure it is. They, after all, are the outcome of the ultimate prophecy of the construct. They are the Sheeple and they hate themselves for it. Underneath it all. Certainly not on the surface. So, they also hate this film for it. It's exactly as it should be. A pretty damn good (not perfect) film that a little more than half love and a little less than half hate. Just like the elections are. Divided among those who think of themselves as 'woke' from the 2 main opposites of being 'woke'. Mainly, liberal and conservative. Religious and anti-religious. Communist and anti-communist. God Vs. Devil. Smith Vs. Anderson. Of course, in this case, there's a third party involved as the controller. Our new lord and savior. Visa Vie 'YouTube' or 'FakeBook' or 'Twitter', etc. More simplistically, 'The Internet'. Too obvious? If that were the case... how did it get so much control over us? Have you not yet realized how much control it really has? Does my review trigger you? Bore you? Scare you? Comfort you? Why does my review matter to you at all? Because you read it on the internet? Because it's stupid? Insightful? Too right wing? Left wing? Where did you first learn these terms? Online? From a talking-head on the TV? A book? So many questions, and so much Matrix to deal with. This film is exactly what we need. Even if we didn't like watching it. Just as the first film was what we needed then. It was just easier to stomach the 1st one back then because the internet was still pretty new, and the first one didn't judge the individual so openly. But, this fourth entry certainly does that. The Sheeple hate that. Happy NEO Year, everyone. Matrix this one a better one than the last 10. At least better than 2021.",9
4179,"Every Matrix sequel, prequel, reboot, whatever, all suffer from the same disease: trying to live up to The Matrix. Seeing The Matrix for the first time was life/consciousness altering. The two that immediately followed, also decent, trying to complete a story, but by then we knew what we were getting. This movie never had a chance.",4
4180,"Takes over an hour to get into it, and acting is so bad it's tough to watch. Thoroughly disappointing. Feels like the special effects are worse than the 1st movie.",1
4181,"There were fun callbacks to the original. The writing was spectacular and answered every question I had. I was on the edge of my seat. Of course, I assumed the ending. However, it's not that hard to guess anymore. I loved the meta commentary. It gave me a good laugh. The story started out very similar to the first movie but as it went on it became a whole new idea. It's called resurrection for a reason.",8
4182,"Whereas the first 2 were more of a continuation, this wraps things very nicely in a more conventional movie with of course a twist in the tale and a very tongue in cheek take on the Matrix fandom and the various ways in which we interpret the original. Excellent watch and well made. Nothing revolutionary but not by any means a mediocre movie.",8
4183,There was a time when I would criticize the sequels heavily. But this is on another level of bad. It's closely approaching made for tv bad.Gone is the amazing fight choreography and anything to do with action sequences.The actors tried their hardest and if they were given anything more to work with they might've been believable. Jessica Henwick continues to impress even with this limited script. The rest probably saw through this money-grab and phoned it in.Fishburne and Weaving saw this coming a mile away and ran for the hills.,3
4184,"Trailer looked intriguing, movie was not.The fight scenes where cheap-flashy, fast and yet the slowest and low effort fighting I've ever seen. Hits don't connect, every punch is extremely slow and has zero impact, no momentum, no force behind it. The fastest punches we see are slower than the slowest punches in the first movie.Ever single gun fight scene takes place point blank and nobody is ever hit, and nobody dies. Even the damn helicopters are shooting so close to Neo he could contract Covid if a pilot coughed.The story is incoherent and leaves gaps where it shouldn't.It was easy to figure from the trailer alone that the plot would be very meta around reality and matrix like we experience it. Yet in the movie its repeated 200 damn times how its all a game, fantasy, so meta, back to the matrix. Yes we get that part no need to over explain it.Then there is the complete lack of information. Niobe gives us the longest explanation on how to recreate strawberries from code and then does a rundown of the whole last 60 years in a few seconds casually mentioning the downfall of Zion, death of Morpheus andI had to google the reason for the fall of Zion and the reason for the outage that made the machines fight each other. Why Trinity was still alive. We never even got an explanation for how they get in and out of this new version of the matrix. Trains? Mirrors? Do phones still work?Just too much info where we dont need it and zero info where we do.Then there is the replacement of actors. Why was Laurence replaced with a different actor? Surely Neo would recreate him as he remembers him and not as a discount, disrespectful, funny guy version?Why is Hugo Weaving replaced with some soft kid that doesn't fit into the role of Agent Smith? Why not at least swap the actor back to Hugo when he regains his power?Blue girl talked so damn fast during her try-to-be-meta scene that I had to go back and throw subtitles on because its gibberish.Special effects wise this was a complete damn failure. I dont know what budget it was filmed on but Id guess it was low. All the dodge/fast combat scenes from the previous movies were cut out. The fights were just boring, no special effects there. Looks like most of the budget went to random bathroom explosions, flooding an office and helicopters.Lastly we didn't seem to need Neo at all for the plot. He was redundant, contributing nothing at all through out the entire movie except endanger IO. Through the movie he went from punching bag, to human force field punching bag then in the end he finally becomes dead weight when Trinity has to carry his dead weight like you need to carry the slackers on your assignment thats due today at midnight.Its not even a forced love story, its just a story of how strong women really are. But is that what The Matrix should really be about?Not the Neo we know; #NotMyOne.",3
4185,"WHY is the key..ask yourselves..why do they make this movie? Dont they know the trilogy was perfect? Why is what seperates us frome you. You who dont want to go deep into philosophy of the matrix.I am not a fan BUT trust me I know what the trilogy try to tell(watched it frame by frame over 30 times)The matrix was the most amazing movie I remember from my childhood. Yet I did not understand it till I watch it like 30 times. Even the sequals which many find them worse than the first, I found them masterpiece. You sure have to watch them more than 10 times to get what they trying to tell. First movie sets you free. Sequals binds you with uncertainty (again) about free will. Is there any? Do they want us to think there is freewill? At the final scene(architect talking with oracle) you can tell IT IS ALL A GAME and it is INEVITABLE. My advice: watch them over and over.Not so innovative as the trilogy in special effects, screen, action but the story is good.Dont pay much attention to actions and special effects. They are like layer of matrix over layers over layers to cover the truth. Understand the story. FREE YOUR MIND.Second time watching resurrectios..I can tell it just blew my mind..",10
4186,"The story is compelling with the right amount of nostalgia while keeping things fresh, but the action and fight scenes lack the sophistication of the original trilogy.",7
4187,"I practically found this movie a mess. New characters without any development. Original characters played by the original actors. Original characters played by new actors, with some hints of the original actors, just so we could identify them. Little to none stuff explained. Neo's and Trinity's resurrection were almost ""Somehow, Palpatine has returned"" level. It was just too much and too little at the same time...The meta humor and the action was good, at least!",5
4188,"I was a huge fan of the original Matrix and I even was ""OK"" with the second and third movies. They had a story, a beginning, a middle, and an end.This cash-grab 4th installment does absolutely nothing for the franchise. It introduces a ""new"" city and new concept of humans and machines living together and that's it. A vast majority of the film is spent remembering the content from the older films and the payoff is, flying off into the ""sunset"" as if to leave it open for yet more cash-grab films.I'll admit I watched most of this film (with some fast-forwarding through some really bad parts) and was relatively happy to be experiencing a slightly different twist on a story I have fond memories of. However once the film is over I'm quickly reminded that nothing has changed, the entire plot for this film was pointless and that they'll likely try to squeeze another 2-3 more dollars.... I mean films out over the next few years.",4
4189,The movie is good. Just enjoy the ride.A special thanks to the heaters for getting the blue pill.One thing you did right; you helped enjoy those two hours and 30 minutes even more.I waited all the way through for a bad ending but the moment never came.Are you ready?,10
4190,"For me personally, I always thought the original matrix was absolutely sufficient on its own and never needed to become a trilogy. I thought the first film held everything it needed to to make it a film where you saw change about to happen and the second and third film ended that. However knowing how popular the matrix trilogy was, my husband was very keen to sit down and watch this.Firstly I must say I found it extremely difficult to watch Keanu Reeves playing his iconic role of Neo whilst looking like he's just come off the John Wick set. Don't get me wrong, he can pull off his long hair and beard like no one else and looks amazing but John Wick is an easily recognisable character due to this long hair and beard. So it just felt a little bit out of sync having him dressed very similar to how he plays another character.The story line felt a little bit weak to me and it felt like a story that didn't need telling. I enjoyed it at the beginning where you find out that the result of the first three films are nothing more than a successful game series that he has created and believes. However when the business partner started getting a bit corny with saying that ""Warner Brothers wanted a new film"" that just put me off a little bit because at the risk of sounding stupid, it seemed unbelievable.I also found it hard to stomach that well-known characters were being played by different actors. Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus was iconic and although I understood the theory behind it, I would've been so much happier to see Morpheus as I knew him in the film. If not in the matrix then certainly in the real world but that never seems to really be addressed. However I will give props to Yahya Abdul-Mateen II for creating a very likable reincarnation. He seems to have spent the time studying Lawrence Fishburne's interpretation of Morpheus and you were able to see glimmers of that in his performance.Agent Smith on the other hand is THE absolute baddie in the film world and in my opinion, absolutely no one can do that character justice like Hugo Weaving did. Particularly not when he's far removed from that to some pretty, blue-eyed heartthrob with perfect teeth. It also feels like Agent Smith's iconic mannerisms were completely lost in translation and being quite an easy character to replicate in terms of how he puts emphasis on things like saying ""Mr Anderson"" seemed to be lost by Jonathan Groff.As usual the matrix films always lend to an impressive backdrop and fight sequences and this film was no exception although the fight scenes did lacks some of the excitement of their predecessors. Keanu Reeves showed quite happily that he was more than capable of taking this role back on and still kicking serious butt and plays the role of elusive, slightly depressive gamer very well. Carrie Anne Moss was a welcome relief as Trinity and doesn't seem to have aged a day but I would've liked to have seen more of the original cast return.One welcome addition to the cast though was Jessica Henwick playing the role of Bugs. Not only was she a very engaging and interesting character, she kicked serious butt and I would quite happily have watched a reboot with her as a character.All in all the film was good but it kind of felt like it didn't really bring anything extra to an already successful trilogy. It was nice in a way to see the peace that was bought after the machines and man called a truce but other than that, there wasn't really any story to tell other than the satisfaction that Neo and Trinity did in fact survive after all.If you're watching this film hoping for a spectacular storyline and you may be disappointed but overall it's nice to tune back in and see where everyone is now.",6
4191,SPOILER.The concept and the general plot of the film seemed alright. It gets to a good start by building up the story but unfortunately it didn't live up to the Matrix name. The Movie was primarily based on saving trinity. And everything about the film was lacklustre. The only thing Neo could do was put his hands up. By the end of the film you realise how terrible the choreography and script writing was. The second worst film I have ever watched in my life.,1
4192,"""That's the thing about strories, they never really end, do they?""This quote from the movie really explains the Matrix Resurrections (2021) You see. The story of the Matrix is very complex. Free will , choice, love , simulation, the real world and etc. These are the things that made original Matrix so great. And here we are 20 years later still searching for the answer to the same questions we had back then!I absolutely love the first movie The Matrix (1999) and the whole trilogy was a success. (Of course many people don't like the Matrix sequels ) and so there will be those who will not like this movie..But I enjoyed it. The Original cast: Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss did a great job. They brought back to Cinema the Iconic duo of Neo and Trinity. Their Love story is in the core of the film and its the main theme. Morpheus and Agent Smith are payed by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II &amp; Jonathan Groff. These are some of the new actors who portray the characters we already knew. They played their parts well. Also starring Neil Patrick Harris - the Analyst. Great casting choice!Story is not mind bending like the first movie. (We really should not compare these films.) But they are very strongly connected , so the nostalgia will hit hard , and it will stick with you until the end of movie. Movie pics up the pieces of the original trilogy and brings you a new story. Resurrection. I could go further.. but spoilers)Visually Film is great , many awesome action scenes and light humor at times. Great soundtrack from the Original movies and the White Rabbit theme was perfect for the story!Overall Matrix:Resurrection is a good film. All Matrix fan should definitely watch it! And. Remember. Don't listen what other people say about this film. Because you can go to the Cinema and check it out for yourself!!In the End You can always go back. Back to the Matrix.",7
4193,"Didn't expect much and was more curious than anything seeing as most sequels made 10 years or so post the original have mostly been terrible and these days all seem to follow the same narrative.Was left pleasantly surprised with the storyline they came up with.The last 10 mins however were a bit of a let down compared to the rest of the movie, wont go into why just watch it for yourself.",7
4194,"I hate it. The Matrix trilogy series has been a game changer. I was really looking forwad to it, but this is only a huge disapointment. So many things were not though through that it is painful.",2
4195,"This film did exactly what I had hoped it would do. The end of the third film, it shows the love and sacrifice of Neo and Trinity, not only for each other but for all of mankind.They also showed how the current architect of this new Matrix, the so called Dr. Is much like our current president. He understands humans, so he uses fear of the unknown against us. He pits us against one another and sets back and smiles at the chaos hes causing.The best part though, is this movie allowed for both Trinity and Neo to be equal. Cause lets face it without each other neither of the two would have survived without the other.",7
4196,This is the best movie I've ever seen!The film from start to finish is very interesting!Ideas and visuals are fantastic stunning .It can also stand out as a standalone film.You'd love to continue.,10
4197,"I rarely see movies with such terrible reviews. Occasionally I open exceptions, and I almost always regret it. Lucy is a good example.But occasionally, a movie or TV show is hammered by negative reviews it doesn't deserve. Jurassic World came out to terrible reviews and ended up being quite enjoyable. And the same is true for Matrix Resurrections. It's not as fresh as the original, but it's a decent return to the story.It could be a bit better if it had:* A smarter/tighter narrative. The core is solid, but it feels occasionally clumsy.* Less plot holes.* Better actors in the supporting cast. Especially Smith and Bugs. NPH was great. Keanu and Carrie Ann were good as expected.* Respectable antagonists (there's enough grunts with horrible aim to remind you of Star Wars).Even with those flaws, it's still a very solid 7 / 10. Almost an 8.If I was a betting man, I'd say the low ratings may be connected to the movie being a little ""woke"". But it's fine and not done in a way that really detracts from the story.People need to chill. The director is a trans woman. If you weren't expecting the movie to be at least a little woke, then you weren't thinking it through.Solid 7. Almost an 8..",7
4198,"I understand so much that you've been through and still go through, Lana. Thank you so much. I cannot stand a woke movie, they're so dry, boring and completely empty. I hope you know how much a lot of us feel. While politics are a tough subject, many people think it's the only way to be. It's ridiculous. I'm grateful that you did not include the woke nonsense that many movies fall for these days.I hope you make a trilogy of this and maintain the non-divisive way of making movies. It's very refreshing.",8
4199,"This was pure darn genius. It tied every single thing from the previous movies together, and managed to come up with a completely different storyline in the process of doing so. This sizzle was dope 10/10 man :)",10
4200,"The movie is truly amazing for us hardcore Matrix fans.Unfortunately, I think it's going to suffer the same fate as Reloaded and Revolutions where people took their misunderstanding of the movie's philosophies and topics and converted it all into disapproval of the movie.Not everyone is going to get it, and therefore they won't enjoy it. And you'll see them on here and Metacritic leaving low scores....Resurrections is a love letter, and explanation of the original trilogy, while expanding the story and explaining what has happened in the time since the original movies.The pace of the movie in the beginning is very fast. YOU HAVE to be up on the first 3 movies otherwise the movie's pace will blitz you. If you're ready for it, it's very exciting. It's a roller-coaster and it's a lot of fun if you're set for it.The tone is different than the original 3 movies. The washed out green-tint is gone. The dramatic slow-tones are gone. THIS IS INTENTIONAL. If you paid attention to the end of Revolutions, and pay attention to the explanation in the movie, you'll understand why things LOOK and FEEL different. People who are complaining about the difference DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION! Don't let casuals influence your feelings/decisions on the movie based on something they didn't pay attention to...The action sequences are one thing I can nitpick. The fighting scenes seemed a bit more focused in the original trilogy, where as in Resurrections, they are a bit muddled, chaotic, and unfocused. You still have plenty of sequences to appreciate the work everyone put in to the stunts and fighting of the scenes. The things they do are spectacular if you appreciate them.The special effects definitely get a healthy update. The transformations of Agents look much smoother. Bullet-time effects are still loyal to the original style.The story progresses so much, it's so satisfying to have many questions answered. And things are set up beautifully for future movies.Acting and character direction is solid. While there are a lot of side characters, they all have great personalities to connect with. Every character has a healthy expressive attitude. Returning characters have great progression and character building added to them. The things each of them is concerned about MAKES SENSE and the connections to the old movies are strong.I was emotionally invested. The actions sense provided tons of suspense. Each milestone moment in the movie left a lasting effect on me.I've been a longtime fan of the series since it first came out. I've watched the original trilogy numerous times. I've watched the Animatrix, and poured of the relevant stories in that series (The Second Renaissance, The Kid, The Last Flight of The Osiris) numerous times. I've played all the games. Even the now deceased Matrix Online MMORPG.As someone that deeply understand universe of The Matrix I think it's safe to say ""I get it!"" I understand what Lana was doing when presenting this movie. And I love it. It was a fantastic movie.Bottom line is - if you're a casual viewer, you're probably not going to 10/10 enjoy it. But if you're a hardcore fan, you'll understand the evolution and philosophies of the movie. You'll understand where things are going. You'll enjoy the answers to the burning questions we've had for almost 20 years now. You'll enjoy the ride.What a ride. So excited for the future of The Matrix.",9
4201,"Feel like I need to take the blue pill after watching this train wreck...or that memory zapper from Men in Black. Seriously a shame. The trilogy will always be one of my favs, but this. Please no more.",3
4202,"The original Matrix for me came at a time that I was dealing with my own little Matrix environment. Trying to get out of a very controlling religion. For this and its Gnostic influences the 1999 movie is and always will be my very favorite movie. And Neo, Trinity and even wacky Smith hold a dear place in my heard. Not Morpheus...because frankly to me he was the real villain of the story. Hell I even love Reloaded and Revolutions a great deal. For its balls to walls action and its Buddhistic undertones.Matrix: resurrections which has been released in cinemas and on HBO Max this week is in many ways very different. Where the original trilogy was precise and managed to some form of perfection the new movie feels far more organic and sometimes even improvised. And yes...already the voice of negativity has been heard in reviews. But you will not hear it from me.But yes...the movie is different. The new matrix in the movie is colorful and vibrant. It is bigger and current. The movie it self has some funny elements and some whacky moments. Most of these come from the fact this new version of the Matrix is run by a power among the machines. And of course by the absurdist elements of Thomas Anderson slowly going insane in a world that seems real, has so many elements that remind him of a past that is not supposed to exist and his life is just weird. Behind the scenes and unbeknownst to him he is being manipulated and handled. Literally at times.The bottom line of this movie to me is that it is a love story. And a good and sweet one at that. Both Neo and Trinity sacrificed their lives and love to protect the Red pills from extinction as the hands of the machines. And Neo as the anomaly sacrificed himself for humanity. But...somehow they are back. Movie magic is funny that way. But for those who love these 2 characters it is only good news. The story of their connection, and the powers they both gain from it this time is a good one. A deeply human and sometimes flawed one.The movie has plenty of action. But here I will say that the action while good old wirefu fun. Is not as impressive as it once was. Why? Not because of any fault of the movie or its creators. But more because we are used to this kind of magic by now. Every movie has it these days.The cinematography is on point however. The sprawling city views of both the human city and the Matrix are beautiful. The acting, set design and CGI are also on point. As expected from soft reboot it has plenty of callbacks. To the point that it becomes a little annoying for those who are not die hard Matrix fans. Personally I know all the dialogue back and front. So its fine. Tho I feel the movie did not have to splice in old footage. I would like to see a version in which we do not have this. Its definitely Member-berry galore at times. I feel the times call for this. We can only wait and see how this ages.Earlier I mentioned not liking Morpheus much. This does not mean that the absence of Laurence Fishburn is not felt. He is a great actor. To me his character was a zealot that send operatives to their death for his fundamentalism. And he ruthlessly took Neo out of the Matrix knowing it could kill him. And it did. The One had to die to become the one. I am happy this movie has Morpheus in it. But a different version of him. A more fun and younger version. The new ship the Mnemosyne is also great. And the addition of machine characters is also a welcome addition to the red pill society.All in all a movie with plenty of action. A worthy story. With Keanu Reeves and Carry Anne Moss doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It is a joy to see them together. And their support cast is more than great. The ending is kind of a call for more movies. Which feels a bit like the MCU disease. Where every every climax is pulled back a little so you will see a bigger one in the next outing. I blame Warner Bros for this. They want money. But also...fine. This means more Matrix for all.",10
4203,"It has a long run time, I think the first half of the movie which is mostly exposition will divide some people, it is very self aware and ""non matrixy"", I think it could have been told just as well in half the time but is visually appealing and I'm sure many will relate to the portrayal of the daily grind.The second half of the movie is where things get really ""matrixy"", it would have been nice to see more of this and less of the first half (my friend though loved the first half so I think this will be a divisive point amongst fans)The core idea was decent though, people may go into depths about how certain phrases may translate into real world issues but as a whole it was told in an interesting way and integrated advances in technology since the previous trilogy pretty well.If I have to pick a single complaint, it would be the film felt a little safe, akin to say a marvel movie. It never really strays too far from ""the formula""If you stop and think too much about the whole thing some of it might seem kind of silly or over the top, the action sequences are also a little sparse and the surrounding characters a little thin (again I can't help but think of a Marvel film) and it might poke fun at itself a little too much in places.All of that said, if you enjoyed any of the original Matrix films I think you can find something enjoyable in this, even if it isn't the whole thing.When it does happen most of the action is visually pleasing and the whole film looks and sounds great.If you have never seen a matrix film before though you really need to watch the original trilogy first.",8
4204,"Confusing at first as you untangle the complexities of what's going on, but once that becomes apparent abs you're following it's a roller coaster of nostalgia and new almost perfectly executed. If I have one criticism it's that I did have to watch some YouTube clips to get clarity on one or two points afterwards that weren't apparently obvious from watching the movie.",10
4205,"Can't believe this is a serious Matrix film. It is so bad I first thought it was some kind of spoof of the original. Seriously don't waste your time unless you wanna laugh at all of the ridiculous sets, scenes and bad acting. This is a comedy.. Not a serious, well written and thought out film. It's truly utter garbage, a joke and a middle finger to the previous films..",1
4206,"I watched the first movie and wasn't sold, but 2 and 3 sold the franchise to me, but this one blew the other out the water.Keano Reaves was too good in this, he nailed the part, he's an amazing actor but this was the pinnacle of his career, no way to top thisDon't want to give too much away, but WATCH THIS MOVIE.",10
4207,"When we think of the Matrix, we think of the blue and red pill, bullet time, 'the one' and kung fu. Remaking such a movie is hard because much mysteriousness is lost in the first movie. What can you even add to a perfect movie?In Resurrections we see the old concepts again, with many references to the original movie which shows that they knew to respect the original movie. We also see some emphasize on interesting philosophies like 'the blue and red pill don't matter, it's the choice we make', choosing to be 'the one' and that 'we are happy when we are controlled'.Also I have to say that some themes like 'binary' are just awesome and really well endorsed in the story. They clearly show a suggested theme of the original Matrix movie.Unfortunately they jump in between cuts in fight scenes too much, especially in the train scene and opening scene. The stunts are mostly simple wireworks. The visual effects are simple distortions. The only awesome visual effects are from the 'bullet time' scene (again) and maybe from the sentients walking around in the human city. I think much of the scenes would be much better with classic dramatic rain, slow buildups, different lighting and a more clear objective. Every scene I was wondering how they get out the matrix so easily, and if they couldn't just be followed. And *can't they just leave any fight scene with a handheld miror?!* These things made the objective of them fighting very unclear to me.",4
4208,"I liked it better than 2 + 3.Huge Keanu Reeves fan. Had to see if Carrie-Anne Moss still has it. She does.The Supporting Cast did a great job. Well written.There was one particular part in the movie I actually stood up, pumped my fist and yelled YEAH! Must have been some sliced onions in the room because my eyes were watering too.All in all, a satisfying movie. A satisfying ending.",6
4209,"There are relatively few films who can have so much cultural influence traced to them as the original Matrix trilogy, for better or for worse. And for the record, this sequel makes a significant effort to grab the ""worse"" by the neck and slap it around.Every part of the film is rock solid. The acting is exactly what you would expect, knowing the actors, and this is not at all a bad thing. The effects are fantastic. The story works great. The humour hits exactly as it should. And the film manages to surprise you and twist your mind like few others since the original over 20 years ago.The world has moved on since then, as has the world of technology the original leaned on so heavily to impart its philosophy. And so, the story and the ideas it conveys has adapted. Not just adapted, really, it has managed to keep its own impact on our culture not just relevant but central to its own message, and it has done this in brilliant ways.Which is likely exactly why it appears to be suffering in the ratings. Some elements of our culture may not be too happy to have a mirror put to their faces in such a manner. But the film is all the better for it.",10
4210,"This movie feels like literally a watered down version of an intelligent script. Somehow it feels good &amp; bad at the same time. Movie tries so hard to be meta with itself, but the metaphors used for conversations falls flat (It didn't excite me). New characters are not explored properly, so we don't feel much connection with them and making old characters silly, miserable felt cheap. Interesting ideas introduced like survival of human race in the new city of ""io"" by co-existing with machines, The whole matrix depending on Neo &amp; Trinity's doomed reality are just glazed over. The choices taken for characters of Smith, Morpheus feels intersting and executed well. The trap created by the new analyst for neo and trinity seems clever until it is revealed how easy and little effort needed for them to break out of it. Action sequences are standard &amp; decent for a big budget movie like this, nothing noteworthy/special. The emotional connection between the lead pair is present in only small doses. The movie ends on a humorous and ambiguous note, which is a strange choice for a concept dealing with free will vs controlled reality. As per usual norm of latest hollywood movies, Every major decision &amp; power is owned by a certain gender, atleast that much is obvious.",7
4211,"I don't know why this film has had such negativity. It is brilliant! Action packed, classic matrix themes. It made sense and I thought it was fantastic!Was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes!So glad this film was made.",10
4212,"The fourth film about Neo is a concentrated nostalgia for latex suits, resistance to the laws of physics, long pathos monologues and the eternal conflict between man and the system. To resurrect her most successful idea, Lana Wachowski picked up some good elements. She gathered an excellent cast of Reeves, Moss, Henrik, Harris and other charismatic actors, supplemented the mechanics of the Matrix a little and again hired a team that knows how to shoot beautifully and put up good fights.""The Matrix: Resurrection"" is hardly a bad movie, but it leaves a mixed overall impression. For those who have recently reviewed the first part of the franchise - including to go to the ""Resurrection"" - the film will simply be an annoying repetition of what has been passed. There is no novelty in it, except for a change of faces and a slightly changed main idea. Now at the head of everything in the ""Matrix"" is not just freedom of choice, but freedom to choose true love.New viewers, most likely, will not see anything in the picture except longing for the past; the ideas of the Matrix about artificial intelligence have long been adopted by other authors. Even the rise of machines and the danger of adaptive technologies are well disclosed in the ""Black Mirror"" - a show that has also become outdated in a few years.And if Wachowski had found a more universal, more understandable emotional conflict for the film, perhaps she would have been able to truly continue the franchise. Instead, ""The Matrix: Resurrection"" resembles the whim of a director who really wanted to give her favorite characters a happy ending.",7
4213,"Lana killed all the best the Matrix has, she wiped, devalued all interesting, deep and smart that we saw in the previous parts.She took away everything that I admired and turned it into a meaningless set of fights filmed by a terrible cameraman.I still have the feeling that I was betrayed.",1
4214,"Yeah, this to me would probably rank third next to the third ""Matrix"" film, but I don't get the hate it gets. I agree that the first third is easily the best part. It has some great meta references where they make fun of themselves for the sequel. It was disappointing to not see Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving again. So, the story is that 60 years have passed and another Matrix has been created. This was caused by a war between the factions of the machines who didn't want to help the humans and those who did.It actually was interesting to see some good machines (or ""sentients"") even though it wasn't the best part of the film. I admit that in the first movie, Neo and Trinity's romance wasn't that well established. This gets a recommendation because it really does expand on that idea. Realistically, given how the Earth was still in ruins after the third movie, it makes sense the world would be like this now. Maybe I just associate with not knowing which pill to take. I'm still glad I saw it and I think the good outweighed the bad...but not by THAT much. ***",5
4215,"I really wanted to give this movie a 4 out of 10, but I morally couldn't do that as I was sleeping through most of this ""experience"".But I'll try to write my general experience:-You can see that Keanu Reeves is just tired of the company's effort of clearly milking the poor franchise until the darn cow is dead.-Lack of Morpheus (can't really blame the man for not being a part of this abysmal movie).-In john wick, you easily forget that this man is in his 50's as he performs like a pro stunt man in his 30's. But here it seems like they were trying to make him look out of shape or old (can't really explain it though).-Let's cut the chase by getting to the main point of my complaining and that is.. the movie is absurdly boring and the story is unbelievably stupid.Can't believe that a huge industry like Warner Bros would do that to one of the most iconic franchises that started from one of the best, most Revolutional movies ever made for money.And I truly don't think that what they got at the end of it was worth the damage.Seriously If you thought about going to this movie, well... don't it wasn't even a very good nap, the horrible sound in the theater woke me up every 5-10 minutes. Seriously will ruin you the franchise and will waste your money, go watch ""Spider-man: no way home"" instead it is freakin amazing.",5

So disappointed. A bad joke. Another stupid squeeze for few more dollars.",3

Also I would recommend this film and at first I had no idea Christina Richie was going too be casted also I have been re-watching her film's four years and she's earned her place in acting. And I would give her a golden globe if it was up too me if she doesn't have a couple already at home.,10
4227,"Why?!? Why is this a Matrix movie?! This is infuriating! (I know I gave it a 6, hear me out).Not because it's bad, mind you. I love the setup, the meta-ness, and the tongue-in-cheek jabs at Warner Bros. And the best part? You're questioning what's real again. The table's set for a solid entry for the franchise...Until...1) The agents. They suck. Wimps. Imbeciles. No longer are they walking tanks, intimidating and menacing. No. Neo used to have his hands full with one. Now anyone can clean their clocks.2) The nostalgia bait. I'm glad they made another film and they took it to a different place. BUT, they had the AUDACITY to patch in scenes from the earlier movies! Whatever the intention, the result for me--and I know I'm not alone here--was catching glimpses of superior flicks and realizing that I'm stuck watching this!3) New actors. I would have loved seeing Weaving and Fishbourne back. But when the reunion didn't work out, THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN REWRITTEN AS DIFFERENT CHARACTERS! Even though the replacements weren't bad, they shouldn't have to rely on guys doing impressions. Let them find their own voice.Those are the biggest gripes. Reeves and Moss seem tired of their roles and it showed. Lengthy exposition makes the pacing uneven. Some of the action looks cheap.Now for the pros. The setup explains the gap between the movies nicely. The newer actors did fine, especially blue hair. People that love the lore will find lots of little nuggets. Like Deadpool, the 5th wall gets wrecked a lot, and it's usually funny. But most of all, seeing Neo and Trinity back together kicking butt is good for my soul. In all, it's worth a watch. At the end of the day though, I'd be much higher on this if it had nothing to do with the Matrix. And much less angry.",6
4228,"""The Matrix Resurrections"" is the first ""Matrix"" movie since 2003's ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" but it is not the first time we've seen the franchise in theaters this year. That distinction goes to ""Space Jam: A New Legacy,"" the cinematic shareholder meeting for Warner Bros. With special celebrity guests that inserted Looney Tunes characters Speedy Gonzales and Granny into a scene from ""The Matrix."" Speedy Gonzales dodged slow-motion bullets; Granny jumped in the air and kicked a cop in the face like Trinity. The 2003 animation omnibus ""The Animatrix"" detailed how the Matrix was created, how an apocalyptic war against robots led to human suffering being harvested to fuel a world of machines; there should be an addendum that includes this scene from ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" to show what it all led to.",5
4229,"I don't know where to start it's too bad. How could I really forget this movie! Bad casting choices near zero role playing, unsatisfying completely superficial fight scenes!! I just hated this movie that killed the matrix soul! I couldn't stand the niobe scenes, way bad guys why did this!? None of the actors were able to give the spirit of the matrix... I feel like crying and rebelling, how can a movie be so bad!!!! I wish I could sue this movie that killed the whole matrix soul!",1
4230,"It was fine. Slowly paced more than half the film. The aging explanation doesn't jive. They Miss Jane Pittman-ed Niobe; not necessary. And does Tif see Neo as we see him, or as the Matrix configures him???? Still glad I saw the movie, even if I had hoped for more for a 4th I stallment. Should have known better.",6
4231,"Well you get it.Neo as back in thematrix, making him believe that he made the games, was good.Seeing faces from sens8, was good.Trinity as the new ""chosen one"", waa good.And that was it allNo acript, no groundbreaking storytelling, half of the movie were the flashbacks, and a boring ""love conquers all"" message.Nothing to blow any mind, nothing unfortunately at all, and this is bad as it compares with itself, and tragically with itself 20 years ago, where everyrhig was less developed than now.",4
4232,Gotta balance the rating with the 10 my dudes.Don't believe the critics. See it for yourselves. Personally I loved it. Don't take it too serious. Happy new years!!,10
4233,"I did not have high expectations to this sequel, however I did expected it to be an action movie.It turns out to be more of an action comedy with a pinch of romance. This movie is the same as Scary Movie is to Scream.... an homage and nothing more than that.",3
4234,"There were moments of beauty - Jonathon Groff is always worth watching. But - good lord. This was painfully slow to get to action and then actually took an epic story and somehow made it TINY. Sooooo long and soooo derivative. I am so disappointed in myself that I spent 2 1/2 hours watching this. What was the point of this entire series, but certainly this movie? Don't waste your time.",3
4235,"Hundreds, if not thousands of scientific and semi-scientific works are devoted to how the Matrix discusses topics such as freedom of choice, the future of humanity, the desire for enlightenment, the illusory nature of being and many others. It's hard to call all this a new word in cinema. But neither before nor after The Matrix were there blockbusters where such a mix of ideas would look organic and spectacular.",9
4236,"It has nothing to say as a work of art, no intensity, no atmosphere, a lot of useless technobabble, minimal boring action, many flashbacks as if to say look how cool it was before and what lameness you watch now, many plot holes, contradictions, Neo was like a bum, Trinity was just there, the rest are completely forgettable.I was expecting to see how the machines live, what they do with the neuralgic network they have created with the minds of people within the matrix. We learned it from when the first came out, the idea that you can use man as a battery is stupid, let it go.When, after all, in the history of cinema, after the third installmentthe movie was good? Never. In five years rebootquel with young actors. And it will be so bad we will say the first four were better.They should have made Neuromancer instead, with keanu reeves as Case, Milla Jovovich as Molly, Carrie-Anne Moss as Linda, Vin Diesel as Armitage, Paul Bettany as Wintermute's voice.",3
4237,"Just like the Terminator sequel , every movie is weaker than the one before it , Neo was blinded in the real world of the last movie , as said , they ran out of ideas.",5
4238,"The movie has a very powerful message to the world that we are all replaceable simple is that , anyone could have been the one and we are all anyone. Apart from the that they movie showed a new amazing trend in videography and I truly loved it , I am sure we will see many new trends.",6
4239,"Before I went for the movie I checked the reviews on IMDB and I saw mediocre ratings by the reviewers claiming this to be an unnecessary sequel ! But this is one of the most astounding add on to the sequel ! Infact when I compare it to the Spiderman sequel I just saw it seemed a bit kiddish , well this was an amazing evolution and the charcters were so well modernized !Watch all three movies before you go for this one it's important ! Amazing ! Thanks for this sequel Team matrix !",10
4240,"If your looking for the experience you had from Matrix 1-3 this aint going to get you anywhere near that.Despite its budget this movie feels like a B-movie, the uninterested acting, lack of unique scenarios, the way to obvious CGI.I know they had to milk it for what its worth and prehaps in a 5th or 6th movie the role of Neo will be placed at a young popular actor/actress feet, maybe thatll be refreshing,but to be honest, the Matrix is better of being animated at this point, or just left on the shelf as a good old memory.",3
4241,"You won't like it if you enjoy bigger&amp;louder sequels full of fan services.Lana Wackowski delivers a smart and original sequel, challenging expectations from the audience, analysing her role in the legacy of a film that has changed everything,Casting is perfect. Reeves and Moss are brilliant.Kind of that may never exists again.",9
4242,"My first watch through I was not impressed with the depths of the philosophy with very basic and obvious questions on ""what is real""? On a second viewing the key scene where Sheperd tells Neo ""Everything was simpler back then. People wanted to be free. It's different now. Sometimes it feels like people gave up. Like the Matrix won."" The Matrix won because we've all become so addicted to the noise constantly being pumped at us or as Merv puts it ""Face-Zucker-Suck"". The Analyst plays on our desires and fears ""Quietly yearning for what you don't have, while dreading losing what you do"". It's a direct commentary on the state of our world today. So glad I was able to take in a 2nd viewing after having some time in between to reflect on it.",7
4243,"It's shocking and not a comfortable watch. Matrix fans will appreciate this, but it might take a few views. This film will take a while to be accepted. Resurrections is clever and pioneering, and refreshing. You either break the mould and create something like this or you keep making the same thing over and over. Matrix fans - go for it and go back to it to decode the deeper meanings.",10
4244,"Be honest for yourself. If you liked the Matrix, but didn't like this, you know why. If you've never seen the original, hi! They're both super sci-fi-y and don't exactly make sense (the suspension of disbelief they ask for is a little too much. Batteries? Huh?) If you're cool and you're willing to ignore that the premise is absurd, watch the original first (tbh you don't need the other two, this more than explains what you've missed) and it's fun! If all you can think about is ""ew i heard this has something to do with trans people!"", just watch passion of the christ again.",10
4245,"The task was very hard: how to make a sequel of a concluded trilogy? Many things could go wrong, right? How to fill the gap of 20 years? How to justify that Neo and Trinity that died are now alive?The first part of the movie is a tribute to the first movie, with everything strange happening, we feel kind of lost, but then, everything starts building up and making sense, and in the end every dots are linked across the Matrix and the real world. The writers did an amazing job filling all the gaps and maintaining the trilogy coherence, I loved the movie and I think I'll watch it again!This is that kind of movie that you'll either hate or love, it's pretty much like Tenet, if you understood it, you'll consider it genious, if you didn't understand it, you'll simply hate it,",9
4246,"I am a big Matrix fan, the franchise released months before I was born, so I grew up watching the trilogy. However, this movie is very dull and otherwise tedious, halfway through the movie I wanted to walk out of the cinema. Characters are underdeveloped, and lack depth, it's essentially an uninspiring love story. The movie should never have been made, I expected better from such a fascinating franchise.",4
4247,"Half of the script at least is designed on explaining the first trilogy. It's not suited to the original fans of the trilogy in my opinion, it's recycled mainly for the generations born after year 2000.",4
4248,"Everybody looks tired except the producers and Neil Patrick Harris. Useless Plot, very slow and complicated. This is a physics class which is as bad as it can get - result you just cant stop sleeping.",4
4249,"I was a bit confused at first, but be patient, it all sorts itself out and then it is nothing short of fantastic. The action scenes, the effects, and of course Reeves and Moss. They brought the chemistry and the bad ass - ness. The vibe was unmatched.",9
4250,"The first matrix movie is such a masterpiece. This film did not surpass the first one, but that's not a shame. Before i saw the long-expected ""Matrix Resurrections"", i had a few questions. How can you make a sequel for a film that already has a wonderful ending?The story is nice. The whole thing is a bit mindblowing and give the trilogy a twist. Sometimes it is difficult to understand (especially for the people who are not very into the Matrix) what is hapenning. I saw the movie two times and the second time was clarifying. I think that i know understand almost everything and if not, i enjoyed it.I was a little bit disappointed that Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne would not come back. It would be better with them, but i understand their choice.",7
4251,"The Matrix was a great movie. Sci-Fi Action at it's best.It's interesting that Hollywood releases movies with similar ideas at the same time and in 1999 we had three with this idea.I thought The Thirteenth Floor had a more interesting take on the philosophical question of is this real or a VR world. EXistenz was different, we didn't know it's a game but the players did.Those two movies might have warranted more discussion on the philosphy than The Matrix. A blockbuster action movie that spent more on great VFX, stunts and fighting scenes than the core idea, but most people didn't see the other two so The Matrix became that conversation center (just like Inception did for many people, when it wasn't original at all)The two sequels tried to expand on those themes and mythology, but failed, mostly because in the end that wasn't the strength of the team behind that movie.Just like I wouldn't expect Michael Bay's astroid disaster movie to be scientifically accurate, one shouldn't expect The Wachovskis to be too smart with their movies, it's not what they're good at.Great action, great VFX, great fight scenes. A story that doesn't make a lot of sense but whatever.I did think it was a brave choice to kill both main characters at the end of the trilogy, basically telling WB we're not doing another one but also not giving the viewers a happy end.Grading on that scale and with those expectations, The Matrix Resurrections is a good movie.It starts with a bit of meta/pat on the back discussion of The Matrix itself, that exists in that world as a video game.It explains why the main characters are around, shows us what happened after the trilogy and basically leaves us with a sense that this world will always be in a loop, repeating it's history in some way.The story, even the good ideas and the little reveal at the end, are just not executed well enough to land and make the viewer care.There are some good fight scenes, some good action, good VFX, none of it as great as the first movie, perhaps because so many other movies are doing the same things now.There's no breakthrough VFX, like Bullet Time, or the Smith clones fight. They even refer to needing a new Bullet Time in the movie, which creates the expectation they may deliver something, but they can't really. That VFX was so groundbreaking, we saw it everwhere for a long while after the movie.The bottom line is, it's an enjoyable popcorn blockbuster action sci-fi movie, on par with parts 2 and 3 but nothing to put it on any list of top movies.",7
4252,While watching I was wondering to myself....did they do this to make $ off the Matrix good name? Pretty clear it was a $ grab film and while having some remaining stars I image the other actors were paid peanuts. When the centinals acted like house cats I knew this was going to be a disaster. I confess I did not finish the DVD as I declared too boring.,2
4253,"I gave the new iteration of ""Matrix"" a view yesterday... Pretty much a thumbs-down for me as I could barely keep my attention on it, even with all the thrilling sounds, color, lighting, stunts and digital effect wizardry. One wonders now that the internet is less a new toy considered a boon to mankind, but rather a decrepit social addiction with all the symptoms of sociopathology, that the people now available for rehashing the series after all these years just don't quite have the umph necessary to do anything interesting with it, even as a digital dystopia work. Then too, an aging Keanu Reeves, who before had a certain charm, but is now barely able to utter his lines with that dried-out voice of his and moves with all the stiffness reminiscent of an aging Leonard Nimoy, makes for an unimpressive and badly handled central character. Then the younger-blood filling in the remaining cast seems really only there to have some kind of playtime as if this were a middle school impromptu play in a classroom somewhere before the teacher arrives back from lunch break... I had a more interesting time watching the special features, behind the scenes production where the people themselves are more interesting to watch as individuals than the movie they made, but still not worth the $2 forked out at a Redbox kiosk. Rather than making a Matrix rehash, they should've made a completely different film more appropriate for not only the cast, but for audiences today.",3
4254,"Only reason this isn't rated higher is because it's being compared to the original masterpiece.8/10 is fair because it has some actionscenes that should have been more flawless, they should have hired the stunt coordinators from the Wick-franchise. There are parts that are more messy than mysterious and thought provoking, like the previous movies, which feels a bit sloppy too. The writer/director has set such a high bar and expectation that this movie could have been a 9-10/10 with tighter fight choreography and a little more effort tidying up the script.I was very happily surprised that the script wasn't just re-purposed parts from the previous movies but overall a very entertaining stand-alone movie.",8
4255,"I really did not like the beginning of this movie, it felt as if the Matrix franchise was a joke the way they talked about it during the first 30-45 mins of the movie. Now after that, that's where it picked up. I loved the choreography, the action was fun and it was nice to see the effects from the original being this polished and real. I never went into the Matrix films for story all I wanted was some great action and I feel that it delivered it for me. Neil Patrick Harris really nailed it as the villain of the movie, it was a nice twist. I didn't really care for Smith in this movie though, it's not the same as Hugo Weaving's performance although I can appreciate Jonathan Groff making the character his own and still making him feel like Agent Smith. Morpheus didn't feel necessary for this movie, it felt like he was being used more to say most of the important old characters were back, however Yahya Abdul-Mateen II gave a great performance so it was easy for me to gloss over it. This movie is nowhere near as good as the originals however it is a good movie in the franchise, it felt like they were setting up for a possible Matrix 5 and if they do I hope that it's as good if not better than the originals.",7
4256,"The worst matrix movie without a doubt that I have watched. There were some good ideas in it like machines vs machines, machines and humans working together, the actor for agent smith. And some bad ones like casting the actor that played Morpheus, the brutal amount of political correctness(everyone in charge was either a woman or with a different color, trinity becoming the new the one and so many more). It felt like the movie was going in a good pace then at the middle suddenly it became very rushed and evolved into a disaster.",4
4257,"Why was this movie made?Casting - F only two characters mattered. Morpheus and Agent Smith were not important to the story at all. Niel Patrick Harris was wasted. Niobe was only there for nostalgia.Plot - F No true threat to New Zion. The machines were quite docile. Neo choices were all for one purpose to get Trinity back. Not to save Zion or the human population.This film could have set up new characters in which it failed miserably. I did not care if all the sub characters died or not. Agent Smith was a wasted character, so unimportant to this story. Overall the worst out of the series. Could have done better by doing a prequel of the others that was viewed as The One before Neo l.",1
4258,"Loved the way it poked fun at the legend of the original - so much better than 2 and 3 - don't get all the hate. Not quite an 8 for me, more like a 7 1/2 but still worthy..",8
4259,Movie is entertaining with lots of past throwbacks with dialogues and actions but What it really lacked was Originality. Opinion is that you should have let Neo dead and the story buried. The only character I liked was a mad guy who was babbling and rhyming some meaningful chat and it was the only part where I found some originality.,7
4260,"The Matrix franchise was one of my favorite franchises growing up. Many didn't like the 2nd or 3rd instalment, but I actually enjoyed them as the Wachowski's progressed a rather complex story while maintaining great action. The dialogue was smart, the effects were cutting edge.Enter the Matrix: Resurrection. This is the largest Wokeness pushing garbage I have seen. It spent the whole movie pushing agendas than it did continuing an already amazing story. I felt that Neo was more like Ted Theodore Logan and that footage from the old movie was what was used to hold up this new installment. Hollywood needs to keep social issues out of movies and just stick to good story telling.",3
4261,I really liked the way they tried to connect this movie with its previous versions. Sure it doesn't have that many action scenes that is generally expected but I found it entertaining nevertheless.,9
4262,"I am a huge fan of the Matrix trilogy and the first Matrix movie is one of my top 3 all time favorites. I really had a very high hope when I first learned that a 4th movie will be out, but lowered my expectation recently after hearing a lot of negative reviews on the movie without knowing the details. However, I'm still extremely disappointed after watching this resurrections version with the mindset that it probably won't be as good as any of the previous sequels.Too many things have gone haywire in this 140 mins long meta story. Like many other fans, I first questioned the reason of the existence for such a sequel, and I still can't figure it out after watching everything that director Lana Wachowski has to offer. There's nothing as deep thought provoking or refreshing because it just lacks the exuberance and inventiveness of those original films. The fight scenes don't seem to matter either and whenever a fight does break out, it almost feels like Wachowski is throwing it in against her will. A lot of the scenes are duplicates from the previous movies and this extends to other non-fight parts as well. Nested in all of this is a constant barrage of references to the previous films. What it mainly does is to take comfort in the familiar, and flesh out the emotional core of a world that always felt a little hollow. There are few exciting moments but they can't save it from a disastrous collapse.I seldom write reviews (actually this is my 2nd review in the 30+ years of my life) but as a true lover of the Matrix world, I have to jot this down to prevent your good memories from being ruined by this.",5
4263,"I don't understand why they use the exact face of john wick for this version of matrix , if they just change hair style or bear would be very betterthe story and scene cant be compare to previous parts.I cant believe Lana Wachowski was part of Matrix 1 !",6
4264,"Don't waste your time watching this horrible movie. I'm really angry that I wasted 2 hours watching this piece of garbage. At one point, I could not determine whether I'm watching a comedy or parody of original matrix. This is what happens when untalented come together to do something.",1
4265,"Just watched The Matrix Resurrections and it was BEAUTIFUL!!! Thank you Lana Wachowski for this!Trinity is a Beast 😍🔥 and Neo is...pure LOVE!!!Loved every single second of this movie!👏👏👏👌🔝🔝🔝Red Pill always ♥Thank you for the ""Second Chance"" 😌👏❤",10
4266,"The story is kind of all over the place, and certainly, the villains are just bland and it's never quite clear what they're trying to achieve. From what I gathered, there were three evil factions/individuals, and to be to be honest, I'm not even 100% sure which of them was the one threatening the protagonists in the final act. I've seen movies fail thanks to poorly written villains before; I've never seen one with villains so poorly written I couldn't tell them apart.There's basically nothing interesting about a single one of the new protagonists either, aside from their hairstyles and sunglasses, which really doesn't help with building tension. They're mostly just there to talk about how awesome Neo and Trinity are, as far as I can tell. The end result is that the action scenes are so boring because you really couldn't care less about who lives and dies.Also, occasionally, there's just pauses to talk midway through fight scenes, and other times scenes kind of just end with a pretty Zack-Snyder-inspired slow-mo shot and then we lunge forward to the next thing, which really messes with the pacing.And, finally, I'm not entirely sure, but I think they were trying to parody the previous films while also being respectful of them, so you get these weird comedy and meta-commentary scenes here and there. Tonally, it really doesn't work very well.There are plenty of worse movies out there, so it's not necessarily a waste of time to watch this, but it's not good either.",6
4267,Horible directing vision. The story is 85% bad.The only ones that play somewhat better are Keanu and Carrie and somewhat the asian captain. The others NO. And the visual effects are a joke for a Matrix followup.,2
4268,"A very disapointing film where they even included a meta commentary in the script explaining why this sequel is being produced and that it will not be good. Unexpectedly There is a scene where it seems like the authors tries to undermine critisicm by having moronic characters comming up with 1-dimensional defenitions of the original Matrix movie.The film has basically zero storyline and nothing ever feels like it is at stake, making it uninteresting and a waste of time.Partly due to the weak narrative and partly due to not having the original cast, they are often resorting to showing clips from the first 3 movies which just... Feels cheap.""Barney"" feels incredibly out of place (I really like Neil otherwise), the replacement of agent Smith was not well done ( a character that is all over the place in this movie), side characters that really does not matter etc etc.Avoid at all cost, there is only 1 Matrix movie and so it shall remain.",4
4269,"Let's define enigma for the moment to mean a movie script rather than a person of puzzling nature and a movie which seems to lack consistency, because that is precisely what this movie appears to be, but it is not. If it were understood for what it actually is, it would have a rating closer to 8 than 5.9.Why? Because the average viewer is looking for an escapist story but is not able to follow it unless they're able to connect the script to what's happening in the world today.The writers dropped some critical ""in your face"" clues to tell us how we're being controlled, the first being ""Face Zucker"". I won't tell you what it's about, because if you're even a little awake you'll know, but if you're not you need to take the red pill and research what's going on in the country today (with Duck Duck Go). Think Zuckerberg.Another enormous point being made was at the end and it is regarding the control of the ""sheeple"". This one is absolutely HUGE because it is precisely what has been happening. The media is controlling the news we receive, and they're brainwashing us with lies. Again, research it. There is much truth in this movie but it's being told as a metaphor. Compare it to the reality of life in the US right now and you will understand.",9
4270,"I thought it was better than a lot of the other dumpster movies out there the past few years. If you like the mind twistiness of the original matrix then watch it through that lens and you'll probably like it. Given the first trilogy went how it did plot wise, I thought this was a great followup. And plausible if you're trying to imagine what AI would do if the first 3 movies went how they did.",9
4271,Well for me it was a really good movie I enjoyed it it was missing more of the crazy fights scenes from the trilogy but story wise it was OK and the cinematography too was better but I wish they left some of the elements from the previous movies like the green look to the environment and brought back Morpheus. It was a good movie to watch don't mind the critics go see it.,7
4272,"The story is nice but choosing the main actors was horrible. If and only if Hugo Weaving and laurence fishburne played on, the rating would be at least 7. Many people still remember the Matrix with these two actor. You can't just remove them and replace them wish someone else. The role belongs to them. There are a lot like if they use the old school, unique Matrix music that would be much much better. Even the shape of sunglasses was changed in this movie.",5
4273,"Worst movie ever, I'm gonna rewatch Matrix Revolution, just to erase this shhhh out of my mind.I'm gonna consider Matrix Revolution the last one.So so many things were wrong in so many ways, from the first 30min I thought maan this is bs....but I watched and hoped this can't be it.How and I mean how can you not put Smith in the movie..and Morpheus...I mean seriously, that wannabe ""Morpheus"" looks like he's from Fashion Week or something.Awfull.",1
4274,The title speaks for itself. The movie literally resurrected the entire franchise. Good to bring in fresh characters without discrediting the old ones. A good movie to watch and have the same quality of the original trilogy.,9
4275,"Waited for a long time and finally appeared.And contrary to all the critics, I have to say: the film is not that bad. And it must also be looked at the film with a different yardstick. That not everything can be reinvented is clear, I think. The first film already did that._____________________________My opinion:The worst part of the film is the appearance of the Merovingian from parts 2 and 3.The best part of the film is the in-depth illumination of the relationship between Neo and Trinity.I think the actors of Smith, Morpheus and co are great.Some new messages are also included. Well packaged and geared to modern times and the characteristics of people.There are also some new features, but they could be a bit more future-oriented._____________________________A final sentence: Meanwhile I find it inappropriate when films are already picked apart before their release by ""so-called"" critics.Go to the cinema! Make your own picture and do not let the critics take away the fun beforehand.",7
4276,I hated some of the recasting but I get it. The action was decent and the story somehow didn't bore me. I went in thinking it was going to be absolute garbage so maybe that helped. I walked out happy I saw it. Objectively a 6/10.,6
4277,"The first half of this movie was exactly what I wanted. Nostalgic, a continuation of the Matrix story (albeit repurposed, but thats the point) with some action mixed in. Great. All for it. Then the second half hit and the wheels seemed to come off the bus. The action -- environment slowed, speaking character real-time -- became the focus and the story took a backseat, including writing, and with rough character lines that were too short, too obvious and almost an attempt to be comical It was too much for me. The focus on the love story was fine, not my cup of tea but like in Titanic, its the vehicle to get the meat of the movie accomplished. Entertaining movie, better than the 3rd, but definitely nothing compared to the 1st or 2nd.",4
4278,I wish I had watched this in the theater unstead of on HBO so I could have walked out.This movie is a romcom with action scenes worse than the 1999 movie.,2
4279,New direction focused on groundbreaking ideas rather than effects and that's a good thing. The car chase is great however and possibly better than Matrix 2. The story indeed fits better for a trilogy and let's hope we at least get one.,10
4280,"It's rare to start off a review by mentioning that politically oriented internet troll campaigns are a real phenomenon, but for your consideration: find one person criticizing recent Star Wars movies for the scripts rather than the diversity. Or look at Amy Schumer, or Black Panther, the list goes on. This movie -- unfortunately for it's own reviews -- is about taking The Matrix back: throwing in obviously LGBTQ, freaky raver characters and philosophical uncertainty after years of red hat wearers appropriating the binary ""red pill"" terminology for their own dogma; using banal self-referentiality as a way to make unexpectedly heavy comments on the limitations of film as a political action; and serving up so many aesthetic changes, as a response to and development away from the filmmakers' own youthful choices, that nearly everybody seemed to think they had lost it, rather than considering that they still wanted to push the style forward. And darkening the joy of all those changes, it's a movie where I find it painful to witness how many casual critiques are prefaced by transphobic comments about the director, seeming to suggest that she no longer had any inspiration or agency.So please, dear IMDB deep-reader, consider this: the first Matrix laid it all out when Morpheus told Neo that there was a difference between knowing the path, and walking the path. Ever since then, the Wachowskis have tried to take viewers themselves along to walk the path, and there's been increasing backlash as they challenged typical good vs evil tropes and narrative structures, and allowed their own stories to be open to life rather than frozen in mythologization.Rather than the victim narrative of a filmmaker losing it under the pressure of contractual obligations, Resurrections is in fact joyfully more of a movie for the freaks than any of the others were allowed to be. There's no more Kubrickian perfect framing and ponderous pacing, instead we get an overwhelming layering of ideas, reframing of ideas, humor, and visual inventiveness. And aside from the meta-commentaries on the real world, we also get a ton of intriguing new developments in the Matrix lore. I've always thought that John Carpenter's Big Trouble In Little China was a hidden influence on The Matrix, and this one recalls it more than anything, in its willingness to poke fun at Hollywood's conventions, to mood shift, to keep the pace up, and to revel in how much more fun fight scenes are with 10 fighters rather than 2.I haven't liked everything the Wachowskis have done recently, and I felt lucky not only that I liked Resurrections, but that something this boldly weird got made at all. For the love of the freaks and freedom fighters in your own life, give it a chance and form your own opinions. There'll be a fresh baked cookie and a brand new Spiderman film waiting for you as soon as you're done.",9
4281,"I didn't have very high expectations for this sequel, considering most of the reboots nowadays are pretty terrible and obvious cash grabs. This movie was pretty good even though it was a pretty big shift from the trilogy. This movie focuses primarily on Neo &amp; Trinity in what became a pretty good action love story. Had a lot of feel good moments.The most annoying part of the movie was the overly cringey guys on Neo's design team. Them alone are reason enough to take the red pill.",7
4282,"This movie's plot (to sum it up) was based on drama aspect of having closure between Neo and Trinity's relationship. And it's sad to see that 4th reinstallment of Matrix has spiraled down from meta-physicality (question of ""what is real?"") to love story of two people wanting to be together. Neo and Trinity was big part of the plot, but they weren't the main plot. It HURTS to say that the Wachowski (bro)sisters missed greatest opportunity to expand Matrix lore with this movie - to throw bits of information about what the real word is like. What state the real world is in, why humans are kept in pods, and why sentient machines have decided that it's better to keep (""all?"") mankind still caged into virtual reality... So many BIG QUESTIONS, non answered. Hollywood needs new spark.",6
4283,Loved it! The character replacements that had to happen were the only things that disappointed me. It still felt like a matrix movie and I highly recommend it.,10
4284,"1 number movie.StoryThis is the fourth film of 'Matrix franchise' released after nearly two decades. The story of the film is not only powerful, but also relevant in today's world.",10
4285,"I am a fan of the original trilogy, it was released when I was a teenager, and it was something really novel. Idea, cinematic everything was novel. Was I disappointed with the new Matrix? No, the plot is really crazy even better than the original has. Is overall movie better than the previous three? Probably not, but it's very decent, it's way better the current 5.8 rating. It should be 6.5+ for sure. Previously Shang-Chi got 7.5, but if you compare one to another, Matrix will win every category. Performance is better, plot is better, everything is better, yet rating is lower. I bet fans of the original trilogy became old and grumpy and put such low rating in comparison with the original trilogy. Overall, it's a very decent movie, definitely worth to watch.",7
4286,"Neo, a God for all intents and purposes is suddenly an emasculated self centered douche who's willing to sacrifice all of New Zion just to be with Trinity again. Why? Just because.Resurrections is hodge-podge of rainbow(literally) characters in a rainbow world. Gone are the binary agents in their black and white suits and along with them the foreboding threat of meeting one. Instead, they fall like sheep. The same is mirrored in the real world, where Sentinels are dodged without a sweat. Gone is the gritty metallic feel of dying Earth. We sense no threat to Neo or the human civilization in general. Everything's peachy!Throughout the entire film, I was hoping that this was a Neo avatar or a ghost of the original Neo... something to explain why he was a lesser version of himself and something that would snap him out of it. But all I got was sanctimonious preaching that without his sweetheart Trinity, he was nothing.",1
4287,"I came in with fair hopes for this movie. I wasn't disappointed. I think they did a great job of weaving in the deaths of Neo and Trinity into a new narrative. The villains do a fantastic job! I have to agree that it seemed like Keanu phoned it in a few too many scenes. For a fan of the series, keep an eye out. Easter eggs abound to the role of key players before they are revealed. It was great ride.",9
4288,"The effects were great, and only the effect.It does not worth the money nor time to watch this, at least not for IMAX.Poor cast, poor storyline, poor setting, and poor continuity.",2
4289,"Way to ruin a perfect trilogy. Was telling myself not to judge since Neo looks more like John Wick for weeks, so I could enjoy the explonation regarding if Neo was killed or not. But this was just sad, from the rambling regarding that the first trilogy was just a video game to the ending.",2
4290,"It's called Matrix bu it isn't. At a first glance it looks like Matrix but soon you realize it's just one more money grab andanother modern generic, forgettable action movie. Oh, it tries to be ""deep"" but failes big time.New Morpheus and new Agent Smit...OMG, what a joke. A bad, bad joke. Two of them together have a charisma of a road kill.To sum it up. Nothing to see here folks. Move along.",1
4291,"I think 15 years ago, I would have enjoyed this movie more. But I still found it interesting enough that I liked it.I watched all Matrix movies opening weekend at the theater. I wasn't going to end the streak with this one. I will watch it many more times on HBO.Thanks Mr. Anderson and Tiffany for the trip down memory lane.",8
4292,It was a film far removed from all the philosophy and old characters that left their mark. I hope you remember and remind of the old matrix universe. Thank you all.,1
4293,In my opinion Resurrection could be considered as a live-action episode of Animatrix. I loved Animatrix and I am okey with this. The matrix has the potential for many more spinoffs both to entertain you and tell you some new stories. Resurrection had its moments. And regarding rating please be straight whit yourself and compare it to.popular Marvel movies! If those movies deserve 8/10 this movie deserves it at minimum.,8
4294,"I was very excited to watch it , hollow movie ,moderate graphic, low budget , bad director ,I can't find something good about itDon't waste your money or time.I'm sorry for matrix fans , this movie destroy the trilogy.",3
4295,"For True fans of this movie you will definitely enjoy this movie. We all know they can't replace Hugo &amp; Fishburne but if you manage to just watch before judging it because of naysayers in the comments you will definitely like it. All the movies seem a bit rushed and they may have taking awhile to make it but overall it's still better than 80% of the movies that came out this year which I might add is filled with CGI, CGI and wait ... more CGI. Lol, the only exceptions in my opinion that has a better storyline and it's own up and coming franchise is Dune, with that being said enjoy the movie because I'm not spoiling it for the rest. #HappyHolidays.",10
4296,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it was fun to revisit this world see what had changed, how the events of the previous films effected this world, all fun stuff.However I really enjoy the previous 3 films, I'm not sure how someone with a more casual attachment would feel about this film?This is like a really awesome gift for fans in my opinion and it's great to have a big budget feature length addendum.So for that it's great, if you weren't that interested in the matrix it's probably not for you.But no complaints from me.It is very heavily interconnected to the previous films, it's meta in certain aspects and very self aware raising common speculations and theories about the previous films.Ultimately it is a very personal film and more a characters Journey wich was pretty interesting to see.",8
4297,"Nothing has changed over the years, people don't have an own opinion and don't listen to themselfs. YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter... cancle culture at it's finest. This movies is just a reflection of our current degenerated generation. We have the tools to think for ourselfs and don't use them at all. Instead we just copy paste another tought. I'm really thankful to this new movie, because it opened my eyes in many ways (again).",10
4298,"A contradictory work whose fatality is irrefutable. Some scenes are amazing. On the contrary, some ideas are very boring. Romantics will probably like it, cynics and realists will not. With a huge budget, actions and effects look surprisingly cheap. The ""realistic"" feel of the first two parts is gone. The use of many shots from previous parts is also debatable.",6
4299,"It wasn't even bad, It just merely exists-which is almost worse.Kept waiting for something cool to happen but it never does.And the fight scenes are a disgrace to the matrix franchise.",4
4300,This movie was such a disappointment. Save your time and money. I guess becoming a fake female don't make you a better story writer. Total garbage. I couldn't barely tolerate finishing it.,1
4301,"This film starts out legitimately well. It's like it knows you have low expectations so it has to prove itself. Before long you'll be following the white rabbit once again. You'll be wondering where it'll take you this time.And you can follow the rabbit. Just...don't go down the rabbit hole, I have damning evidence that Lana Wachowski had diarrhea and resorted to using it as a toilet.",3
4302,"The beginning was a bid odd, but the rest of the movie really made it up. I don't understand where the bad rating comes from. I found it really amusing and gave new insights into the matrix world.",10
4303,"As a huge fan of the original Matrix (and not-a-fan of the second and third), I found this film to be very derivative and uninspired. It plods along between shoot 'em up scenes, and the vast majority of the dialog is hard to understand and, dare I say it, derivative. It tries to be profound and ironic at the same time. (Does not work.) If the writer had focused on the love story and cut out about 30 minutes of exposition, it might have been an okay flick. The one bright spot is NPH's icky sweet nasty bad guy. Camera work/staging is run-of-the mill. Oh, and the ending looked like a zombie film. Go see the latest Spidey instead: it's very good.",3
4304,"I enjoyed the Matrix movies back in the day, but this is one of those movies that should never have been made. Just old liquid in a new bottle. Poor writing, predictable and a waste of time.",4
4305,I didn't have high expectations but ended up really liking it. A huge Matrix fan and have seen the first 3 many times. Obviously not as good as the first but considering how badly reboots can go this was really well done.,8
4306,"I really don't understand the negative reviews.No, this movie wasn't perfect. No, it didn't live up to the hype of the original. In fact, it was nowhere close to the original. But what the heck?IF the creator was going to make a sequel to Revolutions, this is the only way to do it while maintaining the integrity of the film. Our two protagonists died. How else were they to bring them back? It had to be in a matrix. And it's OK that this is a new Matrix, since it has been well established that there have been six previous ones.The call-backs were fine. It's been 20 years. And they weren't obnoxious; they were integral to Neo's plot line.I see a lot of people calling this movie ""woke"" or ""liberal."" The Wachowski films have ""always"" been a critique of our culture. Given the political divide today (which was not so stark in 1999, or even in 2003), it is understandable why this movie is so polarizing. But, it's a Matrix film. Why expect anything less?Yes, it was a different film from the other three. But it's also a different time. Wanting to make something fresh - or even different - is the mark of ant film maker worth their salt. Lana did fine here, too.For me, the movie was very enjoyable and only got better with subsequent viewings. I thought it was great. A worthy entry into the Matrix universe.Perhaps there is a correlation between one's political persuasion and like/dislike for this film. That wouldn't surprise me. But the Matrix movies have ""always"" contained political commentary. That shouldn't be surprising, either.That would make for an interesting case study.",9
4307,"I enjoyed how the character and storyline were resurrected. Well done. The ending, with a smiling and gloating Neo and Trinity standing next to Harris was so 2nd rate, and beneath the rest of the presentation.",6
4308,"Boring. This is what happens when Hollywood studio execs demand a sequel to a popular film but have zero fresh ideas. There are constant flashbacks to the original Matrix, and the (boring) side characters frequently mention the original, so this is really just a weak homage rather than a new film. You'll lose 2 1/2 hours that you'll never get back.",2
4309,"Matrix was ok. It doesn't live up to the standards set by the first 3 films, however, the film is mostly enjoyable to watch and has many references, which Matrix fans will enjoy. The special effects, story and acting were good, but is let down by what made the original Matrix films a joy to watch;1. No Hugo or Lawrence, not even cameos. Was really hoping to watch these 2 characters again. They had such an impact on the franchise. The new replacement actors are good though.2. No stylishly choreographed fight and long action scenes. Although the action and style is there, it doesn't come close to the standard set by the original film. The end sequence was good though.3. Some sequences drag and are confusing. There was a couple of scenes I found to be drawn out and confusing, but overall a good film. Could've done with a tense sequence in the middle. Maybe needs another watch.Overall I would give the film 6.5/10.",7
4310,I gave it 6 stars and this is only because of the history of matrix. I am so upset because of watching this. What a disappointment. I hope it will be better on next movie. Thanks for reading this. It seems like you have lots of free time. You should Do better things in your life.,6
4311,"If I could give a 0, I would give a zero. If it wasn't a Matrix movie, it could pull a 3/10. But context matters. Acting - bad. Storyline - completely messed up and ruined. Characters? Jesus, they made Morpheus into a joke.... a complete failure. The touch of wokeism and ""the message"" makes it even worse... They went to bank on the nostalgia of real fans. They got a heap of garbage. The only redeeming thing in this movie was the cat and Neil.",1
4312,"Needless to mention I am a huge Matrix fan but I tried to take a fresh approach while watching the new instalment. Having expectations is a mistake and it is not just about this movie. Be realist people! Nothing can surpass ""The Matrix"". That is almost a rule. ;)",7
4313,"Matrix Resurrections is a prime reboot-sequence! Lana Wachowski manages to deliver a new facet of the Matrix as intriguing as the first time around. The old characters and the new ones do very well in the film, and the chemistry between Neo and Trinity remains intact as never before. The film's humorous tone is a most welcome surprise. The movie could have gone faster, but even so, it's still a vibrant experience following Neo's journey once again.",8
4314,"This was painful to watch, and I had low expectations going into it.I can't figure out wo would enjoy this movie. It's not for people like me who grew up with the original, and people new to the franchise will only be confused by it.Pretty much every character was an exposition dump, the fight scenes were poorly directed, and the meta jokes more cringe than funny.",2
4315,This movie is a prime example of how wokeness and lazy writing can ruin a franchize. Matrix was my absolute favourite movie. I loved Matrix 1-3 and i still watch them regulary ... but this one ruined almost everything for me. The problem with sequels nowadays is that they dont listen to the real fans and rather make a heartless mainstream movie that tries to pull as many viewers as possible but ends up disappointing anyone.If you are a Matrix fan please listen to me : DONT WATCH IT !,1
4316,"I'm a huge fan of the matrix but this was a massive disappointment. I wanted to love it but i could not stand it. Acting was awful, the story made no sense. Not wealth your time.",1
4317,It think movie is reay good. Characters visual effects story and evrything. It touched the original of Matrix and also added more... Cant wait for more matrix sequals.,8
4318,Nothing innovative. It's the exact same as 20 years ago except Keanu has long hair. Glad I got to watch it free on HBO. Would be ticked if I shelled out $12 for a ticket in the cinema.,5
4319,It has to be said this was very nearly a surprisingly good reboot. I liked the concept of the starting point. The Meta story within Thomas Anderson's Game showcasing the love story of Neo and Trinity.I thought they nailed the meeting of Neo and Trinity in the coffee shop scene.I also loved the advancement/evolution of human beings and machine society and definitely think there's a good film to be had within this world.Lastly some of the CGI was visually amazing.My issue was with the characters themselves. Their motives often made little to no sense and some of the older characters had complete personality and magnerism changes.Mr Smith all of a sudden changing a 3 film habit of calling Neo 'Mr Anderson' to Thomas. Are you kidding me? It's Iconic! I mean I wasn't blown away by Groff's performance anyway but I would say he was doomed from the start with writing like that.Then there is Niobi going against her lifes work to sacrifice it for Trinity which from what I could see gave no advantage to her people in the 'real world'.Honestly the whole script just felt like it was full of hastily written characters who often contradicted themselves.The ending of the film ends up being pretty unsatisfying and apart from some wicked flying scene pretty unepic.All in all the reboot ends up being exactly what most people thought it would be. Another Matrix film that nobody asked for or even needed.,5
4320,"Hardcore fans of The Matrix need to realise that the trilogy effectively ended an era of storylines that started with the first film, there wasn't a way to get back to where Matrix Revolutions ended with it's extended fight scenes between Neo and Smith ( a la 'Rama Vs Ravana' fight from the Hindu myths) . The trilogy had ended with, if I remember correctly, plenty of teary eyed fans who just didn't want Neo and Trinity to die in the last film the way they did. But that was exactly the problem, wasn't it? It was too serious and which is why The Matrix Resurrections had to be different and it is in a good way. Can we just stop hating it and appreciate the new direction the story is taking?",9
4321,"Great marketing upfront, teasers all good. And then you start the movie. But it does not start. It rambles on like an old tape recorder. Action scenes are mediocre replays from M1,2,3 but mainly M1. As are all these replays of actual footage. KR was best unplugged, un-bearded and un-haired (if those are words). The John Wick / KR in daily live look is not wat we/I want to see as Neo I guess. I do like the ongoing love story and the statue of the real Morpheus. Magnet ball Morpheus2 was not such a good idea. Sorry for Niobe that she had to wear a very visible make-up mask. I can buy better masks in a halloween shop. Anyway, the end scene left room for a M5 with a real story with real depth and real characters and real fight choreography. Ask Iko Uwais (the Raid) to help.",5
4322,"Matrix should have remained a trilogy, this was just a disaster. The first half of movie literally had nothing to present except some boring new characters. Although it was kinda nostalgic overall but it wasn't a ""Matrix"" at all.It moved from a masterpiece apocalyptic movie into a teen one.",6
4323,"Wes Craven would of felt a little ripped off.. a New Nightmare with alot more action. (If you get it, you get it) This installment of the Matrix franchise tried too hard to bring the past to the ""now"".. didn't do enough to bring the ""now"" to the past. No one who was unfamiliar with the franchise would have a clue what's going on 20 years after we were awe struck over the oringinal series. No one who knew the original series needed the uncessacarly weird flashbacks that just bragged of a once great franchise..but that being said it was true to the matrix. The action was refreshing, the story came together. It just took its time. All in all, true Matrix fans will enjoy, will appreciate the complexity of the Matrix, but will be disappointed in the choice to simply stay out of modern politics in telling a story that didn't need a reboot or to ""modernize"" it..",7
4324,Seems more like a tribute to the original Matrix with too much repeating scenes from the original. Also the added comedy aspect was completely unnecessary.,5
4325,I love the original trilogy. I don't see them as separate movies but one whole story.This installment is an epic fail. This could have been sooooo much more.Please delete all footage and begin again from scratch.Matrix is updated to Matrix 2 omg. DELETE.RECORDING..........NEOWake up.......Follow the white rabbit.Wow amazing.Thx amd good night.,5
4326,"Well I like it so much. Great cast (except Jada. Even her make up is awful. I don't know why they did choose her ,They have so many options.bad acting )All the other cast were great. Especially Johnathan. He normally is a sweet person! In this film he was beyond great. His eyes can talk !!! Perfect acting. The director choose some familiar actors and actresses!! If you have have watched Lana's works before, you definitely know what I mean.",8
4327,"I didn't expect it to be this good , I don't write film reviews but this movie compelled me to write something . Keanu was amazing and the movie was a complete continuation of the series and didn't leave any loop in the story . I recommend to any one who has seen the first 3 movies. If you haven't though then you would feel lost.",9
4328,"It's like watching a LONG review of the first three movies . Fight senes are slow and lazy AND disjointed , plot is very thin as well . Everyone is just coasting through their lines and motions it seems , no real heart to the action or the script . Gives some closure to what happened to the two main actors ( I guess) from the third movie . All in all a boring movie with too much hype before hand !",5
4329,What a disappointment. Why was this made? What was the point? Can I have my 2 hours back? Only reason I gave it 2 stars and not a negative 10 was Neal Patrick Harris was awesome!,2
4330,"I am not surprised by the bad reviews from non-critics.There are not many new elements in the film, at least in the first hour of it.And the downside would be that the images and directing are not as good as in the first trilogy.But besides a good feeling of deja vu, the movie adds new elements in the second half and makes you wonder of just how the machines will respond to Neo&amp;Trinity's actions. I hope there will be a part 2&amp;3 and that the producers won't be too discouraged by the bad reviews.",8
4331,"Not as good as the first one. Sometimes I lost interest, it felt like it was more based on ""magic"" rather than the science fiction side. More like Harry Potter than Matrix.",6
4332,"If justice league was cut too much and deserved a full length 4 hours movie (yeah it deserved that, if you haven't, go watch it), this one is however, a little too much nostalgia in it - sometimes it got me thinking, am i watching a Japanese anime episode that was put together by clips from previous episodes?Exactly that, this movie could be a solid 8 if you cut the crap out of it. No spoilers but if you watch it you know what I mean.A true fan didn't need to be reminded, they will find out the Easter eggs themselves.DO NOT SPOON FEED ME.",7
4333,"There were some nice nostalgic points for me in this film, but unfortunately it all felt very unnecessary. I thought that revolutions tied it up well, I actually liked that neo and trinity died together. What's more romantic than that? This is an obvious cash grab, like most of the BS Hollywood puts out these days. You will also dislike Neil Patrick even more after watching this bizarre film. Also Morpheus is irreplaceable and I'm sure that upset a lot of fans. 5 stars for the fight sequences and special effects. Which ever director opted out was the smart one.",5
4334,"This ""resurrection"" of the franchise is just OK.The main problem with the film is that it is far too long and sags in the middle. The frequent cutbacks and references to the original films are also a touch excessive and even a bit disorienting at times.Story-wise, the ""Meta"" /self-aware angle had promise, but failed to meet it's potential. There were some cool ideas that just weren't fleshed out or executed well. Then the remainder of the plot was muddled at times and a bit all over the place. I had a hard time following in the first half, in particular.There were also too many overly convenient explanations offered to fill gaps in the plot and/or act as exposition that are just accepted by the characters without pushback.Couple that with some cringey attempts at humor and some unintentional comedy (e.g. The hobo Merovingian, old lady voice, Niobe) and the final product was cheapened.On the positive side, most of the new cast was actually pretty great and cinematography was top-notch as you would expect.Also, although some of the humor missed, there were some genuinely funny moments.This movie might be worth another watch just to get a better handle on the plot, but it's far from the original or even the 2nd film.Ultimately, it was just ok and relies heavily on nostalgia more than anything else..",6
4335,"What a abnormal mess like the head of the director, this abnormal director directed a abnormal movie. Matrix 1 was only one worth watching everything after trash. Thanks for showing the world what abnormal bad movie is like. Is Woke new word for retarded?",1
4336,"I went into this with high hopes. The Matrix trilogy was not perfect, but it presented some very interesting ideas and the first movie, in many ways, revolutionized filmmaking.Resurrections begins with a good setup and I was expecting something different. However, the story beats begin resembling the first movie quite fast and all we get is a remake with very little new ideas. In the middle, the movie just fell off a cliff with drawn out scenes with little content and never recovered. Nostalgia only goes so far.The Matrix universe has the potential of telling some very unique and interesting stories, but this was not it. What a shame.",5
4337,"Unfortunately, this movie is one of those that you keep thinking is about to end but goes on...and on...and on. This Matrix movie has all of the expected fun special effects, and the lead actors are aging well/looking good. Other than the cheesy parts, I most enjoyed the writing on this film. Good stuff.",6
4338,"Being a real big Matrix fan, and already not that impressed by the 2nd &amp; 3rd one, I was hoping they stepped up their game and get back in line with the exceptional high levels of the original Matrix. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. I got hit by multiple new characters popping up left, right &amp; center, with a vague storyline or even value-add, very fast camera movements and a story line so complex you got lost after 15 minutes. As in the past you had a clear overall view of the fighting scene's now you are so clos, you can hardly see anything.Perhaps a 2nd viewing will change my mind, perhaps I was spoiled as I saw the original one right before the new one, but so far, disappointment is the only term that fits the bill.",6
4339,"It's alright movie. Worth watching, just don't expect anything spectacular. Visual effects are nicely done, story ok, actions are (more or less) what would you expect form this movie.If you liked trilogy you will probably like this one too.Just, it is bit disappointing that only few of original actors appeared in movie.",6
4340,"If you like the first matrix chiefly because of the cool fights and the bullet time and you want to know if you'll like M4 - you won't.If you liked the first matrix because of the story about a man learning to believe in himself and being saved by love - you'll like M4. Maybe even love it like I did.Look, I was thinking it too. I'm still thinking it.... I mean, Lana loves to chit chat about art. Has put down E. T. and other films that she doesn't deem high art. And if matrix 1 was all she had ever made I'd be eating up every word she said. But pay attention to other things she has created like ""sense 8"" and you'll see AMAZING concepts that are badly ""cut"" to fit into their containers.Go back in time to 1995 and the warchiwskis worked and worked on that script and storyboarded the hell out of it. I think i read somewhere that they had some marvel friends of theirs help with the story boarding (this is why it now costs $300 to buy the storyboard script book now)My point is that when an idea, a story is reworked so many times it purifies. That's why so many good films are based on a book or play - they've been refined and refined. (This year's 'The Father' is a good example)Anyway, sitting down to watch M4 I was worried because I'd read a lot about it being ""meta"" and ""the woke-trix"".Worry not. The heart is there. Keanu (who I thought was going to be all John wick) was Thomas and neo again.In fact, the first 10 minutes showed me how much of myself I was bringing to the film. Once I decided to relax and just let it happen..... I simply enjoyed every second.Here are the bullet-time points:neo and trin are greatThe antagonist is REALLY goodThe cameras they used for the last 20 mins were terrible. Next time get your iPhone out rather than that god-awful small orange box you used Lana!Music was good. Nice love theme.Lots of ""cool stuff""When we define ourselves, even to ourselves, then we can live.""My name is Neo""""My name is Trinity""""My name is Lana""So many lessons. Thanks for making this you guys.Xx.",10
4341,"This movie is trash. Seems like a parody film or sick joke like a complete ""F- you"" to the fans and movie franchise. It didn't seem canon to the trilogy (although they winged together this fluster of a story to try and connect the film to Matrix Revolutions) , matrix online game, or animatrix. It just follows this idea that people are content in their lives oblivious without knowing the truth or freedom from the matrix and displays the importance/power of love between Neo and Trinity. It's poorly executed and seems like a filler episode. The script had many holes and some of the main characters barely got any screen time! #RIPTHEMATRIX.",2
4342,"Never bothered writing a review before, because I thought that the reviewers were either bored to death or the movies deadly boring, but Holy Mama, this one definately gets the oscar of crapyness, to say the least. Never walked out from a cinema since Alexander the great and never ever did I dare to ask for my money back at the counter. Not 20years and even two years of lockdown managed to make them to come up with something genuine. When I think that there are two more to come, I won't even bother pirating them. How can anybody let this happen? I now know what it feels like to be raped, both visually and acoustically, not to mention the (absent?) script... This is the death of the film industry, run away, you fool!! You ruined my xmas, not even all the alcool of the world will manage to make me forget this pill... Amen.",1
4343,"For the past month, I dread watching the new Matrix film base on the numerous bad reviews by fans and hearing what more or less happen. However, I braced myself and went to see it and I ended up loving it more than I thought! It wasn't terrible, it was amazing. This could be my second or third favorite of the franchise. Afterwards, I looked into these reviews and most of them don't really make sense.The action, while not as great as the last three, has a wonderful story that expand the lore behind franchise. The reasoning behind the recast was something that I think was well thought out. I would admit that the film needed to expand Trinity more to make the final more worth while. Overall, I think the film was unnecessary hatred and I want people to see it for what it's worth. I would love to see more either future films, HBO Max Series or video game.",10
4344,This was on par to the original matrix and to be filmed during a pandemic I can't wait to see what's in store next for Matrix movies games and media starting now. Follow the white rabbit and take the red pill amazing movie making and art made with love that will stand the test of time like the original and for cinematic history.,9
4345,"I love the Matrix (1999) and I thought overall Reloaded was pretty good too. Revolution was a disappointing ending to the trilogy, nevertheless I didn't consider any of the trilogy a waste of time.Despite all the bad reviews, I knew when they made the 4th movie I was going to watch it anyways. And even as a forgiving fan of the franchise, and even with poor expectation, I still find Matrix 4 Resurrections very meh.Let's touch on the positives first. As a fan, watching Neo and Trinity again is like meeting old friends again. And all things considered, it's been 18 years afterall, but time has been rather kind to Reeves and Moss. Do I think they have the same chemistry they had in the original trilogy 18 years later? No. But it was nice seeing the 2 characters on big screen again.And I also gotta give kudos to the movie for making fun of a lot of things from the original trilogy. The jokes are all told in a very weird way, because of the setting of the plot, but frankly I kinda enjoyed them. There's a LOT of homage to the original movies too.Unfortunately that's where the positives end.The plot is super convoluted, very messy, it makes little sense, and it's stuck at an awkward pace between paying homage to the original vs. Moving a new storyline forward.I also hate how both the characters of Neo and Trinity are not consistent with the originals. The chemistry between Reeves and Moss seem to be gone as well.Action is very lacking, there's nothing new either.All in all it is a completely unnecessary movie, and as forgiving as I try to be, all I can say is while this movie isn't a complete waste of time, your time is better spent watching Matrix I, even for the 1000th time, than watching this movie for the first time.",5
4346,"The core problem is that the movie didn't explain huge plot points well and what it did take the time to explain wasn't that important. The movie introduces new concepts, yet there are no consequences for those ideals new to us all. Finally, it asks us to believe in things that have no basis in the previous films, and in the biggest case of ""guess who's got powers now?!?"" kinda pushes the previous movies aside. Add these inconsistencies to the poor story telling you get a movie wishing to redefine a narrative that was a way point for a generation of fans.Put another way, imagine a new Star Wars movie where you find out that Han Solo had full use of the force and was kind of a Jedi, and his relationship with Luke was as what allowed the universe to exist. That would kinda put a dampener on the original trilogy, while bringing in something new, with little to no explanation, in an attempt to rewrite cinema history to pull off one more film.When compared to the Spider-Man juggernaut that is setting revenue records, and Disney+ series set in the Star Wars or Marvel Universes, I new begins to understand why HBO released it for free on its platform. We're this a movie release the news would be more dire as WB would have to explain a piss poor movie in light of Spider-Man. Now this simply gets lost in the shuffle of Hawkeye, The Witcher and the Book of Boba Fett. It will be forgotten in a week or two and fans of the Matrix will simply have their version of The Star Wars Holiday Special or MCU's Eternals.",4
4347,"I loved the original movie, ignoring the sequels, there is now two fantastic Matrix movies in my opinion. I say this because the story arch left me guessing at points, plus there were some spectacular moments, and I always loved the actual matrix world rather than the outside the Matrix world, and this spends a good amount of time in the Matrix. No rubbish cgi like the sequels. Plus I loved some of the adjustment bureau type location jumps too.",9
4348,"Finished watching The Matrix Resurrections. As a big fan here is my review:Aesthetics 4/10:Movie looks like a Brazzers parody. The lighting is artificial looking. DP's didn't know how to emulate sunlight. Colors so saturated looks like an Instagram filter, even the scenes with the real world. I have no idea why they chose to show the clips from the original trilogy with that ugly saturated Blu-Ray color correction version. The lens is so artificially sharp you can see Carrie-Anne Moss facial hair during close-ups. Also the camera is shaking all the time during the action scenes. In the trilogy the camera was 99% of time stable and you could feel the kinetic energy from the fights. The shot composition is so tight and up-close that you can't feel the flow of the action. The editing/cuts during the punches and action is anticlimactic. It cuts at the moment of the punch impact and then changes to another camera.Another ugly choice was the way the camera changed the framerate/shutter-speed all the time it made it looked like a soap-opera effect (I call this the ""Young and Restless"" treatment). There is some greenscreen cringe going on at one point. The matte paintings and special effects in the real world are good though.Story 5/10:The philosophy of the narrative is meta-deconstructionism combined with a heist element genre. Way too much comedy for a Matrix movie. Nostalgia bait with recycled copy pasted shots.Acting 5/10:Morpheus is not Morpheus. He is a pimp from the 70's making out of place jokes. Agent Smith is also miscasted. The actor is way too soft. Surprisingly Neil Patrick Harrison plays solid. Keanu and Carrie are ok too.Ways this movie could have been saved. Hire a genuine good color correction team. Hire a great DP (Director of Photography) like the one from the new Star Wars movies (Steve Yedlin) or shoot on film. Could also do the ""DUNE"" treatment which is shoot digital and scan on film then scan back to digital to emulate film granulation.Conclusion: Watch ""The Last Duel"" instead by Ridley Scott. Great movie with solid filmmaking.",4
4349,"Despite all the negative reviews, I really liked the film, every bit of it.Director Lana Wachowski had lost her parents and was grieving, apparently she made this film as a coping mechanism.Keanu Reeves (Neo) did a good job. Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity) was badass as always. I can never grow tired of Neo and Trinity, seeing them together again was gold.I also liked Jessica Henwick (Bugs).Would have been amazing to see Hugo Weaving reprise his role as Agent Smith. Unfortunately, he wasn't available.Overall, a great movie.",9
4350,"Is really WB executives want it a new reboot, the has a lot of topics that could explore, at the era of comicbook heros is a fresh opportunity to take, but they didnt lissen to fans, this film its like the flop of the stars wars New releases in particular de second one, but its time to be heard, and this film would be forgotten.",5
4351,I really wanted to like this movie. They did a fairly decent job of putting it all together. It just really did not amount to much as a whole. The next day I had zero feelings about this movie good or bad it was just a complete waste of my time. There is no way to get the magic back from the first movie. All this movie did was soil the other ones. Two and three were not great either but this by far was the worst. I would avoid paying any money to go see this at the theater and wait till it's free on prime.,4
4352,"Better than the previous installment, but doesn't quite soar to the heights of the first two. This film feels like a better place to end as the end of the trilogy left too many questions unanswered. We have answers and that's enough.",7
4353,First of all I watched all Matrix movies at theather as a teenager. I read and watch everything related to Matrix for the past 20 years. I am an avid fan of this universe.But Movie felt like something New yet familiar. Great plotline. Self aware of the shortcomings of the universe but tries to expend it into a New direction. It is a double edged sword but Lana watchowski done it very well. Philosophy of the matrix is not changed here. It was expanded. New charachters are great I like all of them. First hour is perfect.I think new generation will really like this new matrix. I for one will go back and watch all there again...If you are a true fan with an open mind I will promise you you will find it refreshing and truly cared for.,10
4354,"The Matrix Resurrections is quite a strange movie. It wants to be a sequel, a reboot in some way and a self-aware parody of itself. But all these concepts difficultly can coexist in the same narrative space and time. The main problem is that some ideas are quite good but executed poorly or goofily. The action scenes are incredibly cheap and lack all the charm, aesthetics and coolness that the previous movies had. Even the music without the genius of Don Davis looks just a fleeble echo of the epic greatness that the trilogy accustomed us to. I save only the ""My dream ended here"" theme which is really good and works perfectly for a specific moment of the movie.The casting of some characters looks incredibly off, a character in particular seems to be completely out of the story, added only to maximize the ""nostalgia"" effect, but it turns out to be weird. Neil Patrick Harris rocks and delivers a great performance. Keanu and Carrie-Anne really give their best and their acting is really really good and emotional. The story might have been better but it's enjoyable and I have to admit that 2 hours and a half passed in a blink. It was somehow entertaining, but it could have been so much better with the return of some of the historical actors and less silly moments.This movie looks sooo half-done/half-baked in a certain way. I really question myself if we really needed it or if Ms. Wachowski have been forced by the studio to write and direct it (and in some way she took this opportunity to criticize the sequel/prequel/spinoff/reboot system of nowadays Hollywood)",6
4355,"I really don't understand why so many people are giving low rates. I loved the movie. I'm a fan of the original trilogy and just like the old ones this movie has a powerful message about the choices that we made and its impact in our path. Among other things, it seems to me as a reflexion about the effects of technology, specifically social media, in our daily life, values, dreams, beliefs and mental health. Important things that we've been experiencing nowadays are beautiful addressed, like woman empowerment.",8
4356,"I think this movie is medicore or nearly good. This is by no mean a 1 star or 10 star film, and i think it deserve to mean seen? Don´t we want more matrix movies in the future? So go support lana wachowski, since we need more female instructors in hollywood.I hope the next will be even better than the first, but i think this will be a trilogy as well.",6
4357,"This movie is convoluted and bizarre. The script is cheesy and really misses the themes of the original three movies. The action really falls short which is something I didn't think possible for a matrix movie. The action really carried the previous two sequels despite their nonsensical plot. You were at least entertained by the crazy kung-fu and cool action scenes. This movie is bland and boring lacking the impressive scenes of its predecessors.The movies also forces many feminist themes in exchanging for essentially giving you a dumbed down useless Neo. Our hero bumbles through every scene and never regains his ""mojo."" The movie end by going through extensive efforts to empower Trinity despite her not being featured for much of the film prior besides as a plot point. The movie's payoff at the end is a let down as our hero is once again just a bystander for it.All in all super disappointing and I am bummed that the Matrix couldn't come back with something better than this.",4
4358,It's so many comms. So many. Guys put on those thinking caps. Look past the Hollywood stunts. Even the lyrics tell you. WAKE UP!................. ................. ................. .................,10
4359,"I'm not much of a reviewer. But I couldn't help myself with this film. Before watching the movie, I was very excited and I was looking forward to seeing it. But after watching the movie, I came to the conclusion that I should visit The Analyst, and perhaps he might prescribe me some blue pills that I would be imprisoned within the world of The Matrix (1999).",6
4360,"Its that bad. From beginning to end, its just awful. I would have been pissed if I paid for this in a theater; fortunately its on HBO. Its like a direct-to-video plot with decent special effects. Its time to delete The Matrix.",3
4361,"Loved it. Was self aware, nostalgic, and action packed. Exactly what you'd hope for when going to a matrix sequel in 2021.2.5 hour movie and I wasn't bored once. NPH crushes it as per usual.Recommend to see it in IMAX.",9
4362,"Why does Neo look like John Wick or John Wick look like Neo.Surely they could have given him a different look to his Wick character, kinda feels half hearted.Also thinking the film wouldn't have lost anything without having Jada Smith in it, binned her scenes off, fitted her dialogue in elsewhere and saved everyone 20 odd minutes on the running time.",6
4363,Okay so what the actual ****? Trinity all of the sudden becomes Neo and can fly? Just because the brothers now became sisters the whole movie needs to be turned upside down?All the characters felt like a mirror of he characters from the first movies so I hopes that would be the plot. That it was like inception within inception. But alas it was boring and had no 'meaning' like the first movie. It didn't really matter.Argh it started out really cool with Neo going insane.Just...frustrated right now.,5
4364,"Lot of throwbacks to the original series. There were definitely some speed bumps but all in all good. If the original was a 10, Reloaded was an 8, and Revolutions was a 6 at best, this was a solid 7-7.5.",7
4365,As a die hard matrix fans this felt like a parody. I'm so dissapointing. Please don't go watch this movie it's bad in all topics and a disgrace for the original trilogy.,1
4366,"If you think this is a bad or boring movie then you might be wrong. Its a very entertaining movie. Not at the level of the original but, lets face it nothing can match that level. You can watch it to have a good time.",7
4367,It's everything a matrix fan could ask for and then some.Don't listen to the haters they are just following the trend...created by paid critics. Watch it for yourself and do keep an open mind.... That was a different era back then.These guys have created an awesome film.,10
4368,"The first half , you will start questioning your own existence it's great writing screenplay everything is spot on ,you will be in the edge of your seat , then they reveal the plot even at this point the movie is still promising, but as it nears the climax the pivotal arc becomes silly , the silly is good but could have been great, in the 4 movies this easily takes the 2nd spot. You can watch it once.",9
4369,Looked great but feels overly indulgent in the nostalgia of the series rather than treating it like the continuation that it is. The pacing is insanely slow while simultaneously throwing action sequences at you in an attempt to keep your attention. A lot of time was spent reminiscing in the first segment of the film when the intense exposition (which is kind of inevitable at this point) could've taken it's place.,6
4370,"While many would assume another matrix film would be like many other sequels; a bad cash grab scenario, Matrix 4 does actually deliver what you want; with.a really smart and nostalgic first act; and a smart and fun act 2;Visuals and choreography is top.notch; and what you would expect from Lana; she delivers steady solo directing; Sense8 fans; will have plenty of DiCaprio moments (once upon a time in Hollywood) as they watch the film.And to be honest; this is the ending (no spoilers) you want to see; after Matrix 3; the last few minutes of the film; will have you ready for Xmas with a big smile on your face!",8
4371,"To much ""blah blah blah"".... Someone hand me the red pill..... there was souch discussion about the past and what ifs, all over getting trinity out. The action was level 2 of 5 for Neo and the matrix.",4
4372,Don't watch this movie expecting great story or mind blowing action.Watch like a true Matrix fan for the previlige of watching Trinity and Neo once more and have fun.,8
4373,"I thought it was a clever concept. 5.7 stars probably doesn't do it justice. I'd give it 6.5 stars, but not 7.2hrs 28min could have been cut back to 2 hours. Just felt half hour extra made it slightly boring to watch whereas Spiderman No Way Home which is exactly the same duration was so much more engaging. Overall OK.",6
4374,The past matrix movies contain 1.2.3 had a good story and you feel Interconnectedness of their story but that is not in matrix 4.the movie contain useless and endless dialogues to show that is philosophical but seem the director is going on to confuse the audience. Not bad see Matrix 4 for 1 time to respect and mourn for the one of the best triology in the movies wor.,6
4375,"As much as I love the Matrix and was keen for another movie following the trilogy, it would have been better to leave it as it was, a trilogy.Carrie Ann Moss is looking good and somewhat youthful still. She's a more natural actor than Keanu, sorry mate, you're still as stiff as ever... but in a Keanu way.",5
4376,"I actually enjoyed the film! Yeah sure there were some slow parts but all in all, it was great viewing.I loved the nostalgia, having some old cast members was really good but mostly I like how it leaves the door open for further sequels.",9
4377,"I thought this movie tied everything together from the previous trilogy! It made sense replacing Hugo Weaving with a younger version (although he's a great actor) as well as Lawrence Fishbourne who although is iconic as Morpheus needed to be replaced for the story line. The only complaint I have for the movie is it was rather slow for the first 45 minutes, but then picked up and finished out strong. Solid.",9
4378,"Short review:We all knew it was never going to be good enough to live up to the expectations. We all knew the saga ended, it was closed. It did not need continuation.Yet they still made it. Because money. And we watched it. Like sheeps. I did too. Maybe it is true that free will doesn't exist.The film? I'd say garbage. *insert look how they massacared my boy meme hereWhy? Lemme explain.Long review:We loved the original trilogy, because it was a technical marvel. We saw things never seen before, like bullet time. Fighting choreography was insane. The concept was almost terrifying. It was all new.Characters were unique, with their own personality, motives, fears, etc (main ones at least). You could love them, hate them, connect to them.It all defined the Matrix movie. We wanted this again. Relive that 'wow'.Yet here we are. Did we get that technical marvel again? Not at all. In fact, they literally put the very same choreographies in the movie. Anything that was new, was at the same level as a 'Z category', low budget, forgetable hollywood zombie movie. Yikes.Characters? Now there were some new stuff. Like that new Morpheus guy? It screams so loud that they did not have the slightest idea what to do with him. The same is true for Smith. They are weightless, almost like a parody. Side characters were so forgetalbe I don't even remember neither their faces, nor their names.They renewed Matrix where it did not need renewal, but made it the same, where it'd have needed. Basically they did the opposite of what should have been done.Storyline? It was okay up until the middle. You really started to get confused what is real, what is not. Briliant.But after that? Gosh. It all revolved around the stubborn love between Neo and Trinity, which would make sense at first glance, but looks like the directors kinda forgot that Neo was keen to sacrifice his love towards Trinity, in order to save humanity (he wanted to go to the city of machines alone, remember?). Now he just wanna go full yolo to save her.Philosophical questions were also a core part of the original trilogy. You had to rewatch the movies like 3-4 times to get the point. Now? It's like a parody again. Like that (literal) bla bla from 'Morpheus', or the new depiction of the Merovingian... And the neverending 'I don't know either' sentences. Like even the creators did not have the idea how to make the movie work.So what happened is: the Matrix lost its identity during that 20 years. Sad.",5
4379,"If you're looking for the truth, you realize that this is the greatest movie in the Matrix movie industry and all the other movies (including Marvel). You are not on the side of a clichéd story in this movie, but in this movie it is clearly stated that wb is looking to make a matrix sequence with or without the main director and only for a reason ""money"". The director's words should be heard from the promoters who say that our originality was destroyed, or Bugs says that they took the matrix and wanted to turn it into an elementary story.In this film, the analyst is the symbol of Warner Bros., and Neo is the symbol of the director and the main character of the film, who was taken from peace and did not want to wake up anymore, but Warner Brother ruthlessly woke him and Trinity from eternal peace because of money.So if you are still asleep and looking for an action movie, do not watch this movie. But if you are looking for reality, the red pill is waiting for you.",10
4380,"They literally refilmed several of the same scenes and sequences. This time around the acting was really subpar. Even Neo and Trinity did not perform as well in this as they did in the original. And there were some especially painful cheesy lines and pretty damn unrealistic scenes. Granted the entire premise of matrix is unrealistic (or is it?), but the first one did a fantastic job at making it real with special effects and good filmmaking. Special effects in this one were just painful.The new story line was not very creative. It was the same story with a slight twist and mediocre acting.",4
4381,"I don't hate this movie, but I really couldn't care less if I saw it ever again. Because as good as some of the ideas are and how excellent the special effects are, the story in the end is just an over complicated rehash of the original. The film makers even go so far as to feature meta flash backs from the original movies, which just served to remind me how much this film misses Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Without there joint screen presence and wonderful performances (which helped to carry the sometimes over complicated and even pretentious narrative of the originals), this installment falls flat on its face. A massive shame as there is some fantastic story ideas and brilliant action set pieces, a big opportunity missed.",6
4382,"I actually enjoyed the first hour of this film because the nostalgic nods were not interfering but a pleasant reference. The idea and story was actually an interesting direction which strangely worked and had plenty of potential.The version of Neo (Thomas) was enjoyable to watch, giving his strange existence and would have enjoyed to see more of this. This early part of the movie reminded me of the first Matrix before the truth becomes revealed and brings some reality to the story.What I think the Matrix always struggled with was the way the 'real world' is portrayed. This was so heavily used in the 2nd and 3rd film it was the cause of their downfall. This is also true to Matrix Resurrections, once we are bought into the 'real' world, all the plot holes and inconsistencies come to surface. The film from this point just kind of becomes bland and dissolves into an 'ending' which is as exciting as a lukewarm cup of water.I would recommend to watch, but only to tick it off. If this was a sports game, Matrix Resurrections would be 3-0 up at half time and lose 50-3 at full time.Needed a better director and writers, could have been great.",6
4383,"From the onset unfortunately this has the feel of a being overall a pretty lame attempt at an original take of an Great movie trilogy. A bit like sitting in a bucket of warm wallpaper paste, the odd bit of cosiness from the odd nostalgic flashback of original film footage, a rather weak attempt at making the movie gel with us older Matrix fans. However for me, the whole thing felt a bit like a bunch of millennials took a great movie franchise, thinking a new take would be cooler and its completely failed. This is The Matrix had it been a B movie.",5
4384,-1 for less fighting techniques and moves-1 for too many cliche.lines-1 for.plot and I miss Laurence FishburneOverall its a decent continuation or reboot or whatever you want to call it.Not much to expect from this tbh.Actor did good. Graphics are ok. Matrix spirit is here.,7
4385,"As mentioned, the third act effectively begins in a coffee bar named 'Simulatte', which isn't even the first time the characters are there to highlight it's importance.And that unforunately summarizes this film very well. There's some clever ideas here and there, but they are glossed over and forgotten about. The civil war of the machines is spoken about for 30 seconds, despite being a crucial element of the film. The new Morpheus is created by Neo in a rendition of his Matrix videogame... no I am not making this up..It's a soulless cash grab by a movie director who needs to self insert herself into the movie, and most likely is only there because otherwise Warner Brothers would have made it anyway. The sad part is that this may have done this movie some more justice, looking into a new direction, but all that is leftover is a rehash of an original trilogy with some machine characters that look to come directly out of a Michael Bay 'Transformers' movie and I'm sure of which the action figures can be bought.It brings back foul flavors of the latest Star Wars trilogy and highlights what is wrong with a lot of the movies coming out today.",2
4386,"""The Matrix"" literally transformed visuals in films, with many legendery scenes that are still fresh in most people's minds. ""The Matrix Resurrections"", however, is rather disappointing. The plot is convoluted and unfocused. The first 30 minutes appear rather redundant, and the speeches about remaking the matrix is very forced. Name checking ""The Matrix"" every minute is not cool either. I already lost all interest 30 minutes in, and it doesn't get better.",9
4387,"Amazing! We've been waiting for this for so long. Beautiful scenes, well explained plot and events that happened after the previous film. Lots of mirroring, which is super cool. Music, CGI and fights done perfect. And as a cherry on top, Lana invited almost all cast from Sense8. It was such a pleasure to see them all again together.",10
4388,"There's not much to say about the matrix resurrections, I think many of us knew it was going to be a run-of-the-mill sequel cash grab, and that's exactly what it turned out to be. I especially below when sequels do this because it drags down the magic of The originals somewhat. A classic example is the phantom of the Opera 2; it cheapened the magic of the original musical in such a way that you end up enjoying that first iteration less after having watched the train wreck of a sequel. I own the first three Matrix movies, they were formative in my younger years, and I will be deleting this one from my collection and trying hard to pretend like it never existed.",2
4389,"My general take on it is, its a weird and interesting take. Turned out great but couldve been a better storyline and maybe not as long. It wasnt bad but also not the greatest. Its nice seeing what happened after the 3rd film but i do feel like instead of revisiting Neos memories shouldve just stuck to an original storyline or gone for a continuation of some sort. Like any other movie youll have some who bash it and others who were really looking forward to this. No joke it felt like a christopher nolan movie in way a since he likes mind bending.",8
4390,"Guess what, it's a sequel. If you can't get past that you can't enjoy it. If you can you'll find a film that is different but the same. A few parts gave my the chills it was so good. Few parts a lil cringy. But over all I like it and how they finished it off better than the 3rd one. But I'm just a dummie.",8
4391,"In my country, a high budget long duration parody named Catrix Resurrections -but I think it was misspelled with M letter-, which is also acted by the same actors and actresses btw, is being played in IMAX theaters. I think it's made for a night show or something but I couldn't find the full video on YouTube to read funny comments. Nice sense of humor guys haha. How and when can we watch the actual movie?",1
4392,Matrix 2 and 3 went down the literal rabbit hole for me and I struggled to maintain interested.For me this is a proper sequel. Fresh idea and some cool concepts still with the love story and the Matrix godmode skills.I didn't think it was boring or confusing - my 8 and 11 year old came with me and they loved it.,8

THIS IS NO MATRIX MOVIECheap CGI effects, poor acting, no script, ridiculous dialogues, bad martial arts, no Laurence Fishburne, no agent Smith....are you kidding me??The cinematography is a joke: Is this a Disney movie or why the images are that bright and colorful?The whole movie was shot in 2 or 3 settings.....Damn, is it that difficult to make a good movie?1 star out of ten!",2
4395,"I was a huge fan of the Matrix Trilogy, so i was pretty excited to watch this new one.Where should i start ? The first movie was a masterpiece, the cinematograpfy, colograding and effects were top notch. This one was shot more like a B movie, it just looks bland and dull.The story is thin and boring, i barely watched it till the end. And the ending was awfull, seemed rushed and pointless.But after the end credits there is a short scene talking if they would be better making cat videos , The Catrix, instead of Matrix 4. Well guys, that seems like a better idea, really.",1
4396,"The vast majority of the people don't understand that Matrix is a metaphore.This movie is as good as any other Matrix movies. Of course nothing is as good as twenty years ago. Just compare all music, movies,visual art, etc with the same from twenty years ago. Still, the movie delivers very well the same message using nowaday's language.Indeed, maybe the first trilogy would have been enough, but the wake up call that this movie delivers is more than welcomed.WAKE UP! EXIT THE MATRIX!",10
4397,"I enjoyed the trilogy, but I was watching this with some die hard fans and we ended up just turning off the film about 30 minutes in. Feels like an Indy student film. Dialogue was terrible and cringy! Maybe this is meant to appeal to gen z.",1

4399,"I came here to write a positive review because all people do is write negative reviews these days for everything and try to bring everything down,no one takes the time to say anything nice about anything and it's embarrassing what we've become.it was never gonna be matrix 1/2 or 3 because they were so far ahead of their time they blew the movie world away,but it's a bloody good movie and I for one enjoyed every bit of it,I'm glad they even attempted to bring us a new matrix movie and I hope it's not the last.",9

Very clever and the way they did this was excellent!!Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss successfully resurrected the chemistry as well!!This was outstanding...I wish the makers/writers of Wheel of Time series were this good and would learn how to not destroy source material, but make it great!!!",10
4401,"In my opinion, this part of the Matrix movies was good until the middle of the movie. Before they entered the city of humans. But from then on, it became a sleepy cliché movie. Also, Keanu's acting was as if you woke up a tired old man and forced him to play a movie. And how unfortunate that Monica Bellocci did not play a role in this episode.",7
4402,"It is so bad it is not worth to mention. Like amateurs wrote the script. It feels like they gathered only 50 people in total to shot the movie. In earlier movies, Matrix felt like it was real thing, that is happening somewhere, but this is a cartoon. Same feeling with X Files (returned). No pple involved. Forced words and actions. No logic. Simply stupid. Do not watch, please.Ewwwwwwww!",2
4403,"I love this film. Clever, sweet, unexpected. Actual. New but authentic.I liked the scenario. The heroes have become closer to the viewer. I love these elderly Neo and Trinity, their problems and their overcoming. The contrast with expectations, jokes and nostalgia inspired me. I don't understand the hate for this movie . It deserves more.",10
4404,"The acting was mostly great, as it was in the original aswell, the music was good, the cinematography was as good as ever but it didn't feel like The Matrix to me. Something was just off.",7
4405,"Non sense story without a purpose... it doesn't bring anything new, and relies on previous movies references seeking for audience interest...Boring most of the time, with only one good scene of action!I really loved the trilogy, and for those who share the same feelings, I recommend not watching this movie!",3
4406,"I'm someone who enjoyed the trilogy and always liked how it ended, leaving me to make my mind up on what the end meant. Resurrections did a great job in continuing and expanding on it.I enjoyed the movie from start to finish, seeing everyone back - which to me was done very well, the action and most of all the story itself left me with a smile once it finished, the actors were all great and I would highly recommend it, especially if you were a fan of the trilogy.Great movie!",8
4407,"I love the first 3 movies - all of them are 10/10! I've read fair few reviews here and (almost) all the negative comments are from people that simply do not like the genre in general, as simple as that!The sequel clearly explains what has happened after Revolutions and the story line is very cathy plus we can see great setup for second sequel (cannot wait!!!).The Negative - Morpheus and Agent Smith...very disappointing that that the brilliant Lana Wachowski decided to change the actors. Don't get me wrong, Jonathan Groff (Agent Smith) and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Morpheus) are doing good enough job but they cannot (and shouldn't) replace Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne. I truly hope that things will change for second sequel.I thought that the Matrix movies were done and I am stoked that this is not the case!",9
4408,"Came in to watch with expectations of complete woke garbage. But it was enjoyable, almost good. It is simple and consistent.While it feels like a parody with throwing around words like nostalgia and bullet time, it is fun and pacing is ok.Feels like these MTV sketches they did for Matrix.If you want to enjoy nostalgia, see some old characters, and same good ol' matrix world, then you might enjoy it.If you want to see something completely new, that was not used in films before like first matrix invented bullet time, then you might not find that here.It also might not be good if you never seen the original Matrix (1999) cause there is not much of character introductions/development.",8
4409,"Anyone who loved the original Matrix will get an emotional rub'n'tug out of this one. The new actors are cool but the old ones take me out of the experience. It's not that they don't perform well, but the passage of time that shows up on their faces makes it hard to forget about this reality in which we all live and in which the movie was shot. I had this issue with Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. There's also that massive success of the old movies weighing them down. While Keanu delivers certain lines, he seems to have in the back of his mind something like ""oh man, fans are gonna go crazy for this one!"".The story is not bad in a void, but in the context of the other movies it's awful. It started out as a parody to the trilogy but then half way into the movie it basically turned into the same thing. The thing that took center-stage was a desperate intention to devise a plot, any plot just so this movie can get made, which is why none of the action feels particularly important.And it messes up the conclusion big time. Neo was the archetypal hero who saves the world through sacrifice and thus gains divine glory. But now, we're saying you can have your cake and eat it too. There can be a happily ever after in this world. It sets unrealistic expectations for any aspiring Messiahs.Another issue I had is the romance between the two, again, because of the age situation. I think romantic love is for the youth and it doesn't look all that great on aging characters. There are things to be passionate about as you get older, and saving the world I think would've been a big enough stake in this case. Freeing Trinity could've been as a means to that end rather than the main purpose. I blame that woman Lana. Saw an interview of her and she seemed quite guilty.",2
4410,"The original Matrix in 1999 was amazing and one of my favorite movies. Thought provoking with many classic lines...This part 4 SUCKED. The storyline, acting, and dialog were simply horrible. I kept waiting for it to get better, and almost left the theater. I would not even watch it for free streaming at home.In fairness, Neil Patrick Harris was good. Keanu Reeves should have declined to be in this epic failure.",1
4411,"I don't like the concept of connecting previous movies with this new one in the first 40 minutes. I don't like that Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving didn't get a role. The first three films gave a nice arc to the story. I also feel the purpose of the whole story is weightless. I feel like this isn't a sequel to the third part. The constant replays from previous movies only reinforced the feeling in me that I was watching a weaker movie. I don't feel Neo's power in his actions, most importantly not even in his sentences. The first 45 minutes were a pain. It's all about the concept of being funny Yahya Abdul-Mateen II reminded me of when Sotuh Park parodied the Matrix in that particular episode. The film gets some points from me because it processed a couple of elements that I was happy to see in the fourth part. The grotesque world and sense of life that is in the real world fits better in previous films. The combination of lights and colors in the new film couldn't give that feeling. Furthermore, the good feeling that could be felt in the Matrix in previous films that Neo and his colleagues flanged as sysAdmins and took care of their affairs was not very felt. I was able to enjoy half an hour of the two-and-a-half-hour movie. Slow-motion doesn't make the movie more enjoyable, it's more drawn. The story was horrible. I feel like Keanu Reeves is lost on the way to filming John Wick 4. There is a lot of melodrama and little action with the original characters. I've been to Matrix 4 like the new Star Wars movies, I'm glad they're getting ready to be a part of it, but the enjoyment value of the new movies isn't even close to the old ones. A new generation may be able to learn to appreciate them. I won't. As an old saying goes, there was money for money. And it will be in the future.",1
4412,"Matrix DestructionIt's a shame !!!!!How this could be possible, you screw up guys.How this could be possible, you screw up guys.How this could be possible, you screw up guys.How this could be possible, you screw up guys.",5
4413,"I was really excited about wanting this installment of the Matrix, but it didn't feel Matrixy, there was something missing, not sure if it was because just one of the sisters and not both have written and directed it.Another reason might be the first Matrix movie was written and directed by the Wachowski brothers while the latest one was with the Wachowski sister. I hoped for more from this, if they're planning a sequel to this, it has to be better than this.",5
4414,Sigma rule #27: You have to give your money to Warner Bros to make a fifth instalment as it was way better then the original movie or even better than all three movies combined!,10
4415,"It's a disaster. The two hours in my life. As they said in the movie, the trilogy has ended and there should not be any sequel. Plus, that's not Chinese kongfu.",5
4416,"The film ""The Matrix 4: Resurrection"" turned out to be a rather strange project. Not only because of the content and visuals, but also because of the rental schedule, which seemed to deliberately sacrifice him to an obviously stronger rival - Spider-Man. Naturally, such a confrontation could not end for the fourth ""Matrix"" in anything good. The opening box office of the picture in Russia turned out to be four times less than that of the film adaptation of Marvel comics. But he may be able to demonstrate decent endurance.",9
4417,"I was very excited after watching the first trailer for the Matrix Resurrections. It looked like there was another question inside -now old- Thomas Anderson. Trailer's sound track was mind blowing with the scenes coming on top. I almost had the same feeling with the original Matrix.Then the 2nd trailer came out, I was disappointed a little bit, it was just a mess. An over excited fan's cut who also loves marvel. But I hoped that was just to attract some other, new audience.I was wrong, the film is %20 first trailer + %80 2nd trailer. Overall a big disappointment!I don't regret going to cinema on the first day, it was exciting. If they make another film looks even worse, I'd still go and watch it just for the sake of it.",4
4418,"Honestly just watch for yourself and don't write it off due to the bad reviews.It doesn't have the original trilogy's 'we bestow deep and life changing philosophy upon you' vibe. And thankfully so. That wouldn't stand these days, and we've already had plenty of that in the originals. In fact the movie even takes a jab at it a few times (Morpheus).The plot is a bit confusing initially but this is what makes it fun. The characters are relatable, in fact more so than in the originals. If you think about it, they were pretty one-faceted and robotic in the original movie (yeah I know, how dare I and so on).Bits of witty humor spread out throughout the movie. I laughed out loud a few times.The ending part I admit was somewhat disappointing, seemed rushed and tacky. But the first 2 hours of the movie were just fine.",8
4419,"The movie wasnt great, it was a lot like most movies today. But it was made to offer a fresh perspective on the old movies, to not see everything as black and white, red and blue, humans vs machines. It was made to open your minds with a neo-perspective (see what I did there).Relax and think... there is always a message in Wachowskis movies.The movie had to appeal to young audiences so all the people who have watched the original Matrix when it came out will not like all the modern stuff like a chick with blue hair, morpheus being a different, younger version of ""cool"", then swearing to look cool, all the cheesey lines, forced dry humor. I get it. Im not a big fan either. But its how movies are made today 🤷‍♀️ the world is different than it used to be.There is still a message the movie conveys beyond all the annoying ""decorations"". You just need to look deeper and open your mind. Maybe true unity isn't limited to human beings only?",6
4420,"I remember watching the original ""Matrix"" years ago with thought this was going to be a typical throwaway Keanu Reeves movie in the vein of ""Johnny Mnemonic"" of nothing more than gunplay in a dour apocalyptic world. Little did I realize the deeper meaning and exploration of philosophy, theology, in the very meaning of life would be explored. It turned out that the Wachowski's gave us all that and more in that movie and (to a lesser extent) the remaining two movies in the trilogy. With that mind, I approached watching ""Resurrections"" with the mindset that it would be an enjoyable but weak cashgrab. I mean, they even overlooked the weak muscles problem that was canon from the first movie! The pacing was a bit on the slow side and uneven initially. I also felt like there was a list of tropes that they were trying to check off one by one just to loosely link it to the previous films.And it started to feel like I was right: it looked like a weaker, inferior imitation of ""The Matrix"".But I could see the momentum was starting build up in the second act in Ion. And the third act? I had gone from sitting and yawning for the first portion of the movie only to be cheering and on the edge of my seat in the final showdown. In retrospect, it makes sense now that the tropes were woven in intentionally because, after all, this is inside a program and the repetition is to be expected! I think the best thing that happened though was how we've switched up villains, revisited others, and all while we know that we probably will see more of Agent Smith in the future! With that in mind, I hope that the Wachowski's will continue a new trilogy and further flesh out their idea that what Neo &amp; Trinity started was a whole lot messier than originally everyone thought.",9
4421,Never thought it would be that bad specially after the first reviews but the creators of this movie should be judged about messing up the with the best movie series ever madethis movie like brouto after naruto.,4
4422,"Waited and waited so long for this movie...what were they thinking.It's clear they didn't know what made the original movies great, so they just re-used all the good action scenes from the last films and then tried to make up a plot about it.Too much looking back, rather than creating something new.So sad, how could they have released this.I'll start writing the next story to help you guys out :)",2
4423,"Neo &amp; Trinity's acting felt kind of too simple.. too slow. They felt tired. Almost like they didn't really want to do it..A couple of characters had something to do, but a whole bunch of others felt like they were just there for the sake of being there.There are several plot holes. A couple new things were introduced that were.. okay, cool.Mostly, though, we see a lot of the same kind of things we did in the original trilogy, but it feels lacking in quality.A few 'messages' were put into the film, that felt too forced, and too strong.+ Matrix is not really the same without the *REAL* Morpheus.",6
4424,A really fun and creative way to bring the new and the old characters together. What The Force Awakens should have been. The second best movie in the series.,8
4425,"I didn't expect much, but a tiny thing: the thrilling moment, when you're starting to doubt the reality and think ""Am I in the Matrix too?""Well done, Matrix, I have to talk to my therapist now.",10
4426,"It's good, but there's a little too much going on and it feels sloppy at times. I was not as impressed as I wish I was. It was a good watch tho. But I'll stick with the first three installments in the future.",7
4427,"I didn't think the plot of the story was great however it was going to be hard for them to top a classic. I thought it was a great action movie. They did a good job with the cast. And I thought the movie was overall good. Lot of people hated on it rated it a 4 but I think they were expecting it to be better than the others and it's like Star Wars, youre never going to outdo a classic. But like the Mandalorian you can make something special without competing.",7
4428,"Glad HBO max is a thing... this was like a lazy high schooler meta video, trying to recap the past 3 films that did it better.... what a lazy money grab. If you can watch it for free, then hey up to you, but I would NEVER pay to watch this.",2

4430,"I think we've been sold the first DLC off of the new Matrix game. They took a cutscene and expanded it to a movie. It's as if you're living the scene where they're brainstorming ideas for the new game. Don't know if this is on purpose, but this movie is as dumb and shallow as the ideas thrown around in that scene. If this was the opening credits for the game or the first episode of the Matrix series, might have been acceptable.End of rant.",4
4431,"There are enough sight gags, flashbacks, and plain stolen stuff from the other three that you need to stay on you toes the first hour. Then it slows down to create what the Matrix never had ... an honest love story. The movie makes it clear it has philosophical statements to make as well. Not all things are black and white. Life is not an on-off switch. It is all the greys and crap in between that brings the joy. It is your friends believing in you, it is the will to go on, when the odds of winning are almost zero, it is knowing people truly care for you that brings the joy and happiness to life. It helps to kick butt everyone in a while, but not mandatory. I humans and living machines can find a way to coexist, then humans can rise up enough to change the world. Even if it has to be on small piece at a time.",7
4432,"Definitely not the same vibe as the first three movies. This seemed to be making fun of itself a bit, and that's fine. This movie was made with nostalgia as it's primary reason it seems. This does a fairly decent job of following the story, and suspending disbelief is necessary, or at least continue being in a state of bewilderment while following the plot.This is more of a love story than the focus on what reality is like for humanity, but it does hint at that. I found myself wanting the lore of the old movies to be more touched on but I suppose the attempt was reasonable. It is, after all, just a movie this finale makes us more aware of that than any of the other movies. The musical score was lacking as well. I may have given it a 7 because I am a fan, but it might have gotten lower without that. Yes, it's not necessarily the direction I would want for this movie, but I couldn't guarantee anything better myself. Somewhat cheesy... somewhat tear jerky... it's hard to say if this would be a movie best left not being made, but maybe... maybe not.",7
4433,"An excellent movie for smart people. Plato told us about the ""cave"" thousands years before,but we still try to completely understand the allegory in his texts and how relevant he will always be....",10
4434,"Before walking into the cinema, I red some reviews. Some said it was good, some said it had the body but not the soul of the matrix universe and some were awful. Well, I don't think it's great or bad, I think it doesn't have nor the body, nor the soul, it's simply a shadow of what the matrix is/was. It is, for the first act, an exercise of introspection about what the matrix was for the the 00s cinema, it will give you also a taste the first movies (shallow, as a reminder of past, not actually living again the past it self..). For the second act, well it's just an action movie.. I didn't enjoy it for this.",6
4435,"SPOILER ALERT! Don't keep reading if you're interested in watching the movie)I actually enjoyed it and maybe it was because of my somewhat low expectations going into it since changes are usually never good for a fourth installment of a franchise. What I did like about was the following:1) More continuing detailed tellings of the love story between Neo and Trinity2) They didn't die and for me the way they brought them back to life wasn't farfetched that I felt in was ridiculously3) the way they didn't overtly tie in the nostalgia to the previous trilogy but gave it just enough to be a nod and have the audience who may not have recently re-watched the trilogy link the past to this present.4) The interesting plot of Neo being manipulated by the analyst who recognized limitless power/energy in the spiritual union between Neo &amp; Trinity's (being that they are the most epic beings that originally foiled the matrix) than just the electrochemical biology of their beings.5) The way they brought BOTH Neo and Trinity out of the matrix differently than in the original trilogy6) The resurrection theory and storyline in this new upgraded matrix7) How Trinity was able to gain the power of the ONE before NEO as NEO slowly gained back his powers throughout the movie8) The analyst reprogramming of the use of the mass swarm and using them as bombs in the end9) How Neo and Trinity was slowly bought out of the delusion of the matrix by believing and loving each another - just great to see how this progressed throughout the movie10) Introduction of the machine sentients and how working together with humans gained much advantages in developing IO over Zion to help rebuild the damaged earth and our humanity with ourselves and other symbiotic sentients10) Neil Patrick Harris performance as well as the main cast.I could go on, but I won't.My feeling is that HBO did a disservice to releasing it simultaneously to streaming for free as a business endeavor. Hopefully, this doesn't hurt the efforts for a new trilogy because I think that WB has something here with the uniqueness of this installment.It's too bad that it seems that a lot of people came into this movie expecting.. well something else, and to this day I don't know what it is - since all I hear is the criticism but no alternative.To me, enjoyed it because it was the Matrix universe, extremely entertaining plenty of non-over-the-top action, wasn't a carbon copy of the previous trilogy and I really enjoyed the new/old characters in the this storytelling.",8
4436,"I saw matrix 1, 2 and 3. Very good story en very good movies.But this one is really stupid and too many childish jokes and childish acting. The story is very bad.How can they mess it up so badly!!",1
4437,"Just watched the movie and I want more...I really hope for the second trilogy. I was dissapointed with Reloaded, Revolutions was much better, but Resurrections is second best Matrix movie.",9
4438,The only way for this sequel to go on is to have a movie like this. I loved how they tied in the old with the new. Action was great and story is set up in a way where they can a sequels. I absolutely loved this.,8

4440,"This is gonna be the short version; but this movie is 50% revisiting the Matrix world and 50% explaining the difference between true movie art and what's fake/ripoffs/cheap entertainment and pacifying movies. Not that this movie is a exceptional work of art, but if you notice the real story and what they are teaching us with this movie, you will see this as a beautiful explanation of art and the human mind, sprinkelt with positive statements and that the strong gender can be both male and female.",10
4441,"-First of all, i watched the matrix first part in cinema in 1999 and watched the trilogy many times and grown up loving them, i experienced the matrix resurrections in imax cinema and i was impressed.-I will start with the visual effects and cgi were pretty awesome, don't expect a revolutionary new concepts in visual effects but expect a high quality well done many hardcore action scenes with fantastic direction-The soundtrack was also impressive mixing between the old theme and new tracks that have the same sympathy and soul and originality-Acting, Keanu reeves is being Keanu reeves which i personally always like to watch, the same as matrix trilogy, john wick..etc, Carrie Ann moss was great, and the chemistry with keanu was lovable, Yahia abdul mateen did well in keeping Morpheus charm, of course i would have preferred Laurence fishborn, but still i didn't get bothered by yahia and he did his job, Jessica henwick introduced a new promising character and blneded well into the matrix world-The story, unlike others here, i liked how they connected to the previous parts, how they could continue the story without being forced, the flashbacks and some of the dialogue were very smart and nostalgic and i believe any matrix fan felt happy watching them-The focusing on the relationship between neo and trinity was a good choice, as we are already connected to both characters and cared for them-Direction was very good and had the dark, philosophical, and beautiful to watch scenes-I believe that some of the bad reviews are because of having very very high expectations, and continuously comparing it to the trilogy, and some other bad reviews are because they didn't understand the concept, the matrix resurrections has many details and making a premise for other parts, so it is like the first matrix for new audience, and a great sequel for old school fans-I loved the trailer, and the movie didn't disappoint me, didn't get bored during the near 2.5 hours, it was a nice experience and waiting for other sequels.",8
4442,I have just scene the movie it is not what these stupid people say .its just to much for them to handle who don't remember previous matrix trilogy.Give it a try it will not disappoint you.,10
4443,"The only quality thing that you get from watching this movie is the outstanding CGI.""Matrix Resurrections""' plot is disappointingly arid. 90% of it revolves around the rescue of Neo and Trinity from the Matrix and, when they succeed, they go and tell the Matrix's boss that they are going to transform it into a more pleasant place to humans. Oh my, what a waste of time...The fights are boring and the new actors, brought in to substitute the ones that got too old, are way less engaging and lack charisma.",6
4444,"I just viewed Resurrections. Although it was enjoyable and a bit anxious building, I felt that it was missing the duality theme from the first trilogy. Maybe perhaps the burden of writing was not shared by the missing Wachowski? Yes Lana is a talented visionary and writer - but there was flavoring and seasoning missing. Throw in some Joseph Campbell lessons?? Although I do have to say that using the JJ Abrams reboot formula works for a retooling of a story ""using old code"" to make new. Still there was a purge - I guess like a modern council of Nicaea.",7
4445,"Matrix resurrection rehashes and goes through almost everything you would expect from a sequel, only thing it does different is that it calls itself out on it's referencing, just like a comedian who rips themselves first in front of an audience so that they can move on to making fun of others. It goes a little overboard with copying exact shots, lines and even making around 15% of the movie to be literal screengrabs of the previous movies which is a baffling choice.The movie introduces boring action, transformers robots and everything you expect from a zoomer Matrix sequel making you get tired of the referencing and squirm in your seat every now and then.It's biggest sin is that it's not fully bad, making you only think of leaving the theater but never actually committing to it, the originality of the screen play is amusing at times and it continues the story too making you curious about how the world actually now is after Matrix Revolutions.It is by no means a good movie but if you are a Matrix fan and don't belong to the ""raped my childhood"" gang, give it a watch when you are sick in bed and scrolling through HBO Max, or watch Game of Thrones season 7 again, it's about the same quality.",5
4446,"I've really enjoyed it. Heard many complains about it. Idea fresh, story smooth and done in old-fashioned way. Sometimes I think I'm too old, some really good movies have a bad rating and ""Marvel"" dog shot has a high.Matrix and the last Resident evil, probably for the people like me, atleast I remember the story, compared to the superhero movies I forget in couple days.Leaving for my rocky chair and cup of tea, too old for new wave.",10
4447,Just caught thr end of the first matrix on TV after having watched matrix resurrection last night. Changed my rating from 5 to 3 stars. The budget and effort for resurrection would have been better spent on an original story.,3

4449,"It was not just a 2nd chance,it was another genesis of a love storyleaving behind all the disapointing critisms.Forget about the dificult philosophies&amp; don't focus only on the action scense.This is nostalgic love storyrather than a cyberpunk action SF.Lana you did it again!Thank you.",10
4450,You need to be fan of the original trilogy to really appreciate this movie. I highly recommend watching the first three before going to see it as there's a lot of references to previous events.The way they added new dimensions to the story was fantastic and some of the new characters introduced really added some freshness to the story. I found my self cheering many times throughout the film and felt on the edge of my seat a few times too.The only thing that let it down was that they wasted the opportunity to make the most of the groundbreaking fx by releasing it in 3D. Millions of fans were expecting the next film in the series to be 3D!I can only assume that all the negative reviews are from people that lack the ability to get the spiritual references and just found it too confusing.A fantastic addition to the franchise and I just hope the decision not to film it in 3D hasn't hurt sales enough to prevent them continuing the story.,9
4451,"This movie was written and directed by one half of the Wachowski sibling duo, and it shows. A little too self-aware of itself at times, with action scenes that look muddled and feel stifled, the seemingly wide open expanse of the previous Matrix movies is reduced to obviously apparent soundstages in this one. Whether it's the budget, or the missing Wachowski, or something else, there are flashes of what could've been a really good movie, but part of the magic is gone. Or, perhaps I set the bar too high? Maybe I overlooked the flaws in the previous movies because I was blinded by the excitement and magic of its newness.",6
4452,"Nothing much to write about, really. Just an alternate ending to the trilogy where neo and trinity could finally grow old together in the real world.The only regret I had with the trilogy was that they changed some of the cast midway.This final installment doesn't add much to the trilogy.",6
4453,"Nicer action, still disappointed as lacking suspence and excitement. Should have sticked to my old rule ""never watch no 4 of a movie series"" (eg StarWars or Terminator) , especially not 20 years later...",4

4455,"This was a fun watch. I enjoyed the nods to the trilogy, felt very selfaware. Didn't expect how Neo's return would be tackled. I would rank it #3 out of the four. Worth checking out.",7
4456,"I've seen the trilogy many times, loved it a lot and always imagined what would it be like to have a new matrix.I was not disappointed.As said in the title, it might not be the best movie ever, but it's actually entertaining, the plot is very interesting and the scenes (mostly the action scenes) are visually stunning.Seeing Carrie-Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves on screen, together again felt extremely good, they still have their chemistry and they deliver, period.All the other actors were really good too, and their characters were integrated into the saga extremely well, I felt everything was as its rightful place.Now, I do think that if you're expecting a ""copy"" of the original movies, this might not be the movie for you.It's a new take on something that everyone loves, and for some people that might not be it.It differs from the original saga not only visually, but also in terms of storylines; it's not a movie about a war with a love story in it, it's actually a love story that started and could end a war.Sounds cheesy, but it's not, I promise that if you're a fan of the original movies and can keep your mind open to the splendid ideas and filmmaking capabilities of Lana Wachowski this film will be definitely worth a watch.",9
4457,"I was able to see this due to being released in Thailand on the 16th earlier than most countries. This film reminded me quite a bit of terminator genysis, that it was a bad movie but was a bad film for the matrix franchise. Way too much comedy, the story ended up falling flat and overall wasn't a film that was needed. If anything it feels like it takes away from the franchise instead of adding to it.The film wasn't an entire let down, there were some nice elements to it but overall those elements were underutilized and ended up being wasted. Not a film I'd want to watch again.",6
4458,"What is the Matrix?Is it what you feel?What you hear?What you see?Yes it is. But in this movie, you can't see any of this. Because Neo is dead, and the Matrix is down.You can't feel the style of Matrix anymore.Can't hear the sound and the music of Matrix.Can't see the visual world of Matrix.So the Matrix atmosphere that is made up of the above is not there.Ergo, this is not the Matrix.It's just a poor, fake version of it, and you know it.Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. You have to watch the first part! Then you will know. At the same time, you will realize what you have always known. That this is no longer the Matrix. Far from it.Huge disappointment. And since I was a kid, I've been hoping for a sequel (or rather a quality sequel). What a pity, what a wasted opportunity. They crushed one of my childhood favorite universes (for the second time since Star Wars).5/10Ps.:And there was a huge bug in this fake Matrix. Somehow Neo was replaced by John Wick, disturbing the space-time continuum between all existing movies. Oh, and there was a problem with Agent Smith, too. It was as if some amateur comedian had taken his place. Hugo Weaving must have been quarantined during filming. And I would rather not mention Morpheus. He died too. Or not?",5
4459,Please don't listen to the haters. The new Matrix movie is terrific. I absolutely loved it. Even my girlfriend who only liked the first movie said it was almost as good as the first one.,10
4460,The plot is totally irrational. The film does a disservice if you are a fan of the prior 3 films.The machines have an internal battle and one side wins over the other. The peace treaty that was set after the last film is broken. Then things get really stupid....The reasin as to why the winning side of the machines brought back primary characters is absurb. This film is a retread of the first 3 literally but with worse special effects and an embarrassing plot that leads nowhere.,4
4461,"After screening the movie Matrix Resurrection (4), I have mixed feelings.On the one hand, I really liked the new core of ideas that such relevant to our not optimistic time. Like this one: the system changes heroes. If heroes resurrect, they are not interested in resistance and sentimentality; they want to become new System Architects.On the other hand, the action in the film was a mess of battles, as if the movie director said, yes, you need entertainment, so get it and leave me alone. I felt tired by many unnecessary episodes and some crumpled plot lines.In general, I would recommend watching the movie if you want to get some answers to the classic Matrix trilogy, but don't expect this movie to be some super extraordinary spectacle.",6
4462,"It was enjoyable, I really liked it. I liked the mix of Morpheus / Smith. Smith's new version wasn't bad either. For me, the story was also perfectly traceable.",10
4463,"Fans will like the action scenes as they were well orchestrated but I actually found them tiresome. Cinematically there was much to admire, the plot and motivation of the characters, not so much.",4
4464,"The original Matrix was one of the best movies I had ever scene. This Resurrections film was bad. No Laurence Fishburne, but we get a 90 year old Jada Pinkett Smith... No original vibes, music, lighting etc. Very corny one liners that came across cringe instead of nostalgic.Hard to watch and a maybe bummer!",5
4465,"A self aware movie; in this times where nostalgia is raging it's so refreshing to see used here in a meta commentary about how silly and cash grab it can be...i love the movie, but don't get me wrong, is a divisive movie. A lot of people are gonna hated it, and i can understand why... it has an univen scrip, a lack of action scenes, some acting problems and a shift in tone that is all over the place...but the heart of it all it's still there...the chemestry between Keanu and Carrie is still pounding hard, and lana as a director still manages to frame beatiful shots...like the oracle said in the matrix revolutions: ""some bits you lose, some bits you keep""...if you love the first one and have mayor problems with the rest of them, this is not for you, dont even bother...but if you find something in the secuels worth your time, your not gonna regret seeing this movie...",8
4466,"I'm tired of movies that seem like they should be good but just fall short of their promise. The first half is actually phenomenal; it pulls at the heartstrings, really starts well and asks some interesting questions, brings back some nostalgic characters (although not enough, missing Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving), even makes fun of itself at a very meta level... but still manages to just fail to deliver any punch at the end. Not only is there no resolution, but it seems to ignore some of the implications of the end of the third movie (despite referencing the events... shame we can't just wish that away).In fact, all the Matrix sequels have failed where the original shone brightly. This one is even worse because it has so much potential.Neil Patrick Harris is awesome, though, even if his character is poorly explained. And Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss still deliver on their original vibe. While the rest of the cast's acting is on point, the characters just aren't developed enough.I suppose if this is the start of another trilogy, maybe I'll come back in a couple of movies and revisit. But for now, this just failed to land. If it was a standalone film, yeah, maybe it'd be a few points better, but everything in it has been done - in fact the best part of this film is references to the original. So save yourself the trouble and just go watch the Matrix again.",5
4467,"I hope you all are getting the torrent since watching it in the theater is a serious waste of money. It represent an example of how some people only want to earn even more by recycling and making poor sequels and then destroying the whole story. I was hoping that this movie will be at least an average one, but they managed to ruin it completely. Therefore, the best option for all matrix fans is to avoid seeing this s**t.",1
4468,"I am a dedicated Matrix fan. Watched the first one in theatres three times. Absolutely love these movies. People are hating on this movie because their expectations are way to high. I felt I got the closure I needed and it was handled extremely well. Given the age of the actors and all that has happened in the previous movies m, I strongly feel this was a perfect homage to the series. Don't expect to be blown away by any means. The special effects are amazing and so is the storyline. It explains enough. Well done ! I'm happy I didn't listen to any of these garbage reviews and went and saw this right away!Go see it!",9
4469,"You can't find a better Matrix parody than this. I cannot believe that they even convinced Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss to play in it. The budget and the casting make it the best parody in the world. The CGI robots were great for a parody. I think they served their purpose of making people laugh. So, I'm not even mad, just waiting for the real Matrix to come out. Jokes aside, this was the worst movie I've seen in the cinema. It was not even okay or bad. Lana Wachowski butchered the Matrix. I can't even find the words to describe it. Every aspect of this movie was awful, from CGIs to even action choreography and acting. In short, this is a high-budget Matrix parody that killed the legacy even split on it without respect. I can't even believe how Warner Bros or even her sister Lilly Wachowski allowed it in the first place. Thank you again for killing my childhood :(",1
4470,"It's a fresh approach, with hints of nostalgia. They modernized the franchise and the discussions are focused on the present day. The film's action is decent and the new actors and characters are well characterized and competent in their roles.",9
4471,"Ignore the haters, people.This is a classic Matrix film. Full of action, and considering we've a near 20 year gap this does a good job at explaining what's happened in the world.The new cast do a great job of bringing a fresh and dynamic approach to the story, which when combined with the skill and storytelling of Keane Reeves make this for quite compelling watching.Yes, a few bits don't work, but that's the Matrix!",8
4472,Was great seeing everyone but it has more dialogue than a Merchant Ivory movie. Effects and visuals are great but literally they spend most of the movie talking out loud and explaining the plot vs creatively moving the story forward.,5
4473,"I have no idea what they tried to do here. For the entire duretion I felt like someone was sitting over my shoulder talking in my ear ""hey, do you remeber this movie we made 20 years ago and it was a huge success? Yeah, this is a sequel to that one. See? There's this scene from that successful movie we made. Also this, remember this? Yeah, it's the same"". It felt like they didn't even try to make this one rise to the level of the first movie and it feels like they are relying solely on nostalgia and star power. The other characters felt bland and uninteresting. I realized after almost 2hrs (because that's about where the action starts) that I don't care for any of the them. This more of a quick cashgarb than something that someone actually cares about and there is even a scene in the beggining that kinda feels like a jab at WB.",2
4474,"Ya movie is not upto the expectation...............................but watchable..........,.......................the movie which came in 1999 and 2003 are better than this one...",6
4475,"This movie proved that Lana is nothing without Lilly, just like Neo is nothing without Trinity!!!! I regretted seeing this movie, it should've stayed in my memories as it was before: a legend. It's not how it should be concluded!",5
4476,"Had some hope for this to be good but just another rehash of the previous 3 movies, in an in your face kind of way. Wait until it comes onto steaming platforms instead of spending money on it.",1
4477,"There was a lot of potential, but it felt almost cartoonish and ""too colorful"". Too many flashbacks, I thought the idea was to make a new movie but it looked like it was used to remember the good times more than creating new plot for the story. It didn't feel epic, it didn't feel important, it felt like there was almost unnecessary to do all this work and I don't get the point.It was clear from the beginning that this movie was forcefully made (when they basically point out that Warner Bros. Was going to make the movie anyways) and that's just sad.There was peace between the machine world and the humans so what was the reason for all of this? Maybe I missed it but I don't think it was that clear.Oh yes and let's disregard all important lines of Morpheus as along we get some fight scenes. And of course let's make the new Morpheus flashy and ""fun"", he's drinking now and making some snarky comments.I like the idea of machines helping, I like the idea of people not wanting to leave the Matrix. There were elements that had potential, but the delivery in general was not good.6/10 at most.",6
4478,"To be honest: I was not really satisfied after the first watch of the movie. But after I have watched it again and recapped the story and all the little details and references, I am now really happy with it. The only thing what I still criticise is that the fighting scenes and action scenes have not been filmed nicely and also cut to fast. I am still wondering why this was done (obviously on purpose? I mean there must be a lot of talented people in Hollywood to do this job). Therefore I have missed a little bit of the kung-fu spirit. That would have done the film a lot of good. The current cut of this scenes is too hectic for me. However, overall a great sequel.",9
4479,No word is enough to describe how disappointing this movie is. It kills and undermines everything. The production is like the movies you watch at 3 am just to keep the tv open.My expectations were pretty low but this movie is not the worst Matrix movie but also one of the poorest movies I have recently watched.,1
4480,"This part of the Matrix, in my opinion, turned out to be poor compared to other parts. All the parts before that were still surprising, new filming technologies were used, new unseen special effects and it was fun to watch. In this part, The Matrix Resurrections idea was maybe good, maybe not, or maybe just untapped. The filmmakers tried to reach the hearts of the audience by using nostalgic videos from past parts of the film, but I think that nostalgia was used too much and unnecessarily, and it didn't help to win the hearts of the viewers. Of the characters, I liked Jessica Henwick (as Bugs) the most, but she's not the main character. I think more was possible from her. The official movie thriller is not badly designed, but has a big problem, it shows a lot of spoiler in it. The overall rating could only be average, as there is a lack of special Matrix effects, as they are the hallmark of this film. But as a fan of the Matrix movie, I rated it more than average. Viewers didn't get what they expected.",7
4481,"This movie does not deserve 10 stars, it is 7,5 at best, I gaved it 10 because of all the haters that lovered rating so much because they expected something special like the 1st one.It is an OK, fun movie for an evening watch, that does really fine reuse of moments from the 1st movie, with no forced pc thats all over these days.",10
4482,It was perfection. Loved every second. Will definitely watch again. It really ties in some old characters that I missed. What a fantastic love story! This movie makes you think. A unique adventure that makes you remember the past movies.,10
4483,"It's like somebody pulled a dusty corpse of a closet and beats it for 2 hours - the whole movie basically talking about the past, very little new story. But, somehow, at the same time it's also soaked with all sorts of new social ideology lingo as a cheap bait for the new audience.",5
4484,"Out of every sequel I've ever seen, this is by far the most surprising, cleverly delivered kick-start of a franchise I've ever watched.If you watched the Matrix 18 years ago for action, then this was enough but you missed 80% of the main substance of what was being delivered.This movie is not about fight scenes, it is not about special effects. It's about revisting a world that very cleverly and gradualy fills in the gaps of the ""what happened inbetween"" then and now as you watch. Revisiting old characters was brilliant. A few moments had the cinema chuckle.The upgrades in the real world are well executed.At the end a ""I knew it"" moment happened. This normally feels disappointing but I was made to feel that the roles were reversed slightly between NEO and Trin.I'm honestly gobsmacked that people would call this a cash cow.Don't watch it if you think it's going to be action packed madness. Don't watch it if you're not prepared to use your brain at the beginningIt's well executed. We'll ballanced and I thoroughly look forward to the next.",10
4485,"Totally rubbish, after watching 10min into the movie. First thought it was a fan made cut somehow got into the cinema. Didn't understand if it was a real movie or a comedy parody. I can't believe Keanu Reeves has agreed to act in this farce. It appears like this whole thing was scripted in 10min and no one has reviewed it at all. WB same like with space jam just can't produce a decent movie anymore. I don't talk about the effects and CGI but the basics, lack of basic cinematography, acting and just in general story telling was none existing. So disappointed this was created, should have left it as it was. Also, why so much feminism, I get strong women leadership and all, but why overdo it by so much.... Anyway, have never ever wanted to write a review about a movie that I cared so much, what a disaster..",1
4486,"I have had an IMDB account for years but never bothered to post a review because I often agree with reviews of others so repeating what others have already said always seemed redundant to me. This movie was so bad it made me post my first ever review on here.Having seen the trilogy, I went into this with no expectations and was still disappointed. The entire movie felt like a badly written fanfiction. The absence of Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne noticeably brought down the quality. There was no tension throughout the whole movie.Don't bother and go rewatch the trilogy instead.",
4487,The first half and second half feel like different movies. If they just stayed with the themes of the first half of making fun of sequels/reboots and kinda mind bending what is and is not real for the main character for the whole movie it would of been more cohesive &amp; better. Matrix 5 could of been the second half of what we got in matrix 4.,7

4489,I don't know why they made this film. It's like insulting the previous the Matrix trilogy.Neo is not like the Neo we used to know. And why the hell they make a different morpheus?,5
4490,"We waited for a sequel, but what we got is a movie which can be called as ""Reboot"", only change is they don't need telephone booth any more, instead teleport window is there.If i was the script writer, i will write script in a way that Neo and Trinity is resurrected and with Neos power he destroys the matrix and release everyone and then togather with Morpheus and others they start a battle with Machine World in which they won at last, the End.",4
4491,"As the prime Matrix did, this sequel shows the absurd reality that we live in. Especially since 2020.Take the mask off and choose the red pill.The vaccine is another program I'm afraid...",8
4492,"While the action aspect as well as the visual part of it look great, the movie as a whole just feels exactly what it should feel like - a sequel to an already finished movie.",5
4493,"Besides tying up loose ends from the trilogy, I don't think they could have gone any other way story wise while keeping it credible and fresh so well done !",7
4494,"It was interesting to start with the iconic first Matrix action, plus the Inception effect like making games at Deus Machina !The efforts of Washowski to remain in parallel with the M1 flashbacks was cool, but it came somehow at a cost of losing Freshness in battle actions, and actors...Now this seems to be just an amuse bouche for further next chapters awaiting !",7

4496,"Ok after watching the awesome trailer for Matrix Resurrection a gazillion times I was so looking forward to watching this.Then sadly reading the scathing attacks the movie was getting from people leaving it really bad reviews, it dampened my expectations as I thought this was another occasion where they had produced an awesome trailer but the movie was yet again a major letdown.So this evening I sat back and put on the movie expecting it to be garbage, boring and a movie that would drag and put me to sleep.Instead I was glued to the screen from beginning to end and I LOVED it!! I'm even gonna go ahead and say I would watch this a hundred times before I ever watch the awful 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies. Heck in SOME aspects I think it's even better then the original. Yes I said it. If you don't like it you can go chew on a lemon for 2 hours.I would give it a solid 7 or 7.5 but due to all the negative reviews people are leaving it I'm giving it an 8.One word to describe this movie.. AWESOME!Ignore the haters and fan boys. Watch the movie and make up your own mind people.",8
4497,"I don't understand how you can disgrace the continuation of the series that came out 20 years apart. What else did you espect to happen, the movie met all expectations and it was very well connected as a subject.",10
4498,"As someone who is not an active fan of The Matrix Series, I know my opinion doesn't matter and I'm glad it doesn't. I've only seen this movie and the first one only to understand this one, so please understand that.I sort of understand the hate for this movie, but I also really enjoyed watching this film and I don't think the hate is that necessary. I wasn't trying to look into this movie going into it, and I wasn't looking for a way to discredit it. I watched the film not knowing what they did to promote it and how the fans thought of it. I had a good time watching the film mostly for the action and intensity. I just came in not expecting much and came out happy with what I saw.I don't fully understand the hate the more I think of it, but I think I might know the reason. I think people felt that the existence of this movie was unnecessary and was made for no reason. What I say to that is that I could not care less.In my opinion, I believe that all movies are made with the intention of making money. Some more than others, but still. As long as I can't whether it was made with the intention of ONLY making money, I'll be happy with what I see. The fans of this franchise will definitely understand how and why it was made more than me, and that's not my fault.Regardless of the reason it was made, I really liked watching it and I couldn't tell if it was made for any other reasons other than making an enjoyable movie. Even if it is, I couldn't care less.",9

Lana transistioning from Larry, Lana saves Larry and Lana is the lead now.The Action wasn't anywhere near as good as the other Matrix films but the story line was much better than the other sequels and has cast film 3 in a new light.The Hovership is called the Mnemosyne and is basically the story line of the first part of the film. Mnemosyne is an old Japanese Animie about a woman that finds a man with distorted memories. She discovers that he is a clone, his memory lacks realism, because they are actually written into his brain by artificial means. -A bit on-the-nose really!The Merovingian is Right Wing Politics and cancel culture. The Merovingian doesn't like how new media has changed the world, he was cancelled. He hates The One, and wants it to go back to how it was in the olden days of the original Matrix and Neo is the target for his dissatifaction with the world, even though Neo didn't change the world/matrix, the machines did. The Merovingian looks like a troll and 'twitters' on-and-on about nothing, never making any sensible or coherant points and then dissappears, never refered to again, like a troll moving on.I really liked Neil Patrick Harris, and I assume he partly was cast because he is one of the few openly gay Hollywood Actors that had to keep his sexuality hidden for years before coming out.My original favourite order of the films was 1, 2, 3. It's now 1, 4, 3, 2.",8
4500,At first I wondered how they were going to do this with the main actors being 20 years older than they were and the conclusion of the 3rd matrix. To be honest though I loved that they made Neo not as butt kicking and older yet still just as dangerous. Then Trinity in the mix. Overall it was actually my favorite sequel. Well done. You can't top the 1st but this definitely makes its mark.,8
4501,"How many have been waiting for this movie. Something grandiose was expected, just incredible! I once again reviewed the trilogy and today I went to the 4th part.The whole movie had a feeling that something was about to start, just about...but it didn't start. I left the cinema with the feeling that I had been deceived.There are practically no battle scenes. And with Neo alone at all. He doesn't do anything. Only stops bullets. Only protection. In this film, he is lost, has no power, for so many years it barely glows.A lot of chatter. The whole movie is la la la. Of course there are wonderful moments, very cool. But this is a drop in the bucket. Only the last 10 minutes of about the film justify the film itself in general, that's what I wanted to see all 2.5 hours.",8

4503,"Worse than expected.The beginning really caught my attention.But then it went off the rails.There's nothing interesting.Poor performances.Silly story.Stupid Architect. Neil is awesome, which is sad.Agent Smith became a spoiled moron.Stupid machines.The movie revolves around a pseudo-love story.The ""real"" world and its fire-like code remains unexplored.The real Matrix stuff was ignored.Resurrecting was a bad call as it turned outIt would've been better leaving everyone dead.If you're going to watch it, take it as comedy.",2
4504,Matrix is my number 1 film of all time. Big call I know.But for me it has everything I love in a movie.This instalment is cleaver and worth your time.Just don't expect too much.,7
4505,"While keeping all of the elements that worked in the first three, it added many satisfying inside jokes and deft references. I was so glad they kept Keanu and Carrie Ann without trying to make them over too much. The new Morpheus and Smith were well portrayed and dapper (although I'm still not clear on what Smith's angle was). The only low point for me was Naiobi's character arc into a schlub. Loved the aesthetic, the noise, the signature action.",10
4506,"Total disappointment after 2 and 3 I was hoping this would be so much better but it's dreadful it even has the dragon out of how to train your dragon ,oh well end of review 😢",3
4507,"If you compare this to the original you will be disappointed. I still give this a 7/10. Not bad, but not great. Apparently I have to have 150 characters to submit this so here I am just filling it out.",7
4508,"This movie was awesome! I don't understand all the negative reviews. As a huge fan of the original trilogy, this was almost everything I could've hoped for in a franchise sequel/reboot. And it was largely the kind of thing I expected from the creative mind of Lana Wachowski. I thought it was brilliant!I have to assume those who aren't digging Matrix Resurrections were likely never really all that invested in the story of the original trilogy to begin with (at least, not beyond the first film, which now only constitutes about 25 percent of the entire story). My advice, for whatever it's worth, is to go into this movie with an open mind. If you have a rigid expectation for what a fourth Matrix movie ""should"" look like, I think you're more likely to be disappointed. As with the previous installments, there really is so much good stuff in this release to absorb and really chew on. I think multiple viewings will be very rewarding. More than meets the eye here, and it seems it's going way over a lot of people's heads. And I could easily see this developing into a whole new trilogy. Do I miss Laurence? Absolutely! But I'm also not convinced he won't be back at some point either.If it weren't for all the negative reviews, I'd probably give this a solid 9/10... but I'm rounding up to a 10 to offset the haters who always give movies like this a 1-3. I realize we all have our different perspectives, and I try to account for that... but seriously, anything less than a 6 or 7 on this movie is just criminal and not even credible from my POV. And I'm saying this in direct relation to the earlier installments.",10
4509,I was so happy when i heard this was coming out. Anyone who is stating this is a rework or just another 3rd wheel. Maybe watch the film alot more. Theres plenty of secrets in matrix 4 ressurections that answer questions. 60 years of knowledge you get to witness what happened after the war. Why it fell apart what happened to zion. Youll have to watch it to learn but im in love with how characters are introduced model-01 as a program. Even mr smith put a smile on my face. Neo and trinity now that was how my jaw dropped. And the love for having programs and humans now is fantastic.10/10 going to be watching this over and over.Hope number 5 will become a thing so much i want to know.,10
4510,"It's really not that bad!Sure, I have seen better and certainly worse. It is not Matrix (1999) but a well made, entertaining action movie.With this in mind, go ahead and give it a try!",7
4511,"This movie was a metaphor within a metaphor within a metaphor. It's too bad that the top IMDb review is someone who gave it only one star and said, ""I didn't know what was going on for the first forty minutes.""That was the point. Neither does Thomas Anderson. The ease of the mind grab is a direct reference to what's going on in our society today. If I had to sum up the point of this film in one sentence, I would describe it like this: ""A film in which one of the original screenwriters has us entertain the idea that some of us only THINK we've taken the red pill.The satire is brilliant, too. Forced to write another screenplay or lose the option, that reality is added into the storyline.In conclusion, if you liked the original Matrix just because of the fight scenes, you missed the point then, and you're missing the point now. Try seeing this one a second time, and this time as you watch, compare what the characters feel, say and do-- every line, every dilemma, every point of confusion and fear-- to what is going on right under our noses out of the Matrix, in our own world. If you still don't get it, you might be Team Blue Pill and just not know it.",10
4512,"Yes this movie is like 7/10 or around that area! It is not a 1 star or a 10 star, but why all the hate?We have all the great cast of the past(minus lawrence fishbourne) and Keanu is doing a great job in this movie, we need more matrix films, and this is a decent start to the new franchise.Good movie to watch it.",8
4513,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS*Many of the criticisms of Resurrections are very valid. Resurrections is at times over the top, at others confusing and incoherent and it will likely make zero sense without having watched the original trilogy multiple times. The cast are largely unmemorable and even Keanu came across at times like he had regretted agreeing to the film. The first part of the film could have been a parody, a 'Scary Movie' for the Matrix.I'm not sure another review needs to repeat these.Resurrections is however aptly named and my score is because of the opportunity the film gives the Matrix saga, not the quality of the film itself.The Matrix is one of my favourite films and it ended perfectly. Neo was 'The One' and he was going to save humanity, we didn't need to know how and were better off not knowing what came after. Unfortunately, we found out. The sequels were enjoyable films but deconstructed this perfect ending and gave us something that was underwhelming and hugely disappointing.Resurrections' journey is messy but it gives the Matrix series another chance at an ending. I obviously have no idea if this was the intention, but it almost feels as though the sole purpose Lana Wachowski agreed to Resurrections was to do just this.Neo (this time, with Trinity) will finally save humanity and we really don't need to know how. And I really hope we don't find out, again.",9
4514,"I'm giving it a 6 (previously rated as 8 to counter the unnecessarily bad ratings but I can't bring myself to leave it at 8 even if it was for the greater good). Either way, I stand tall that It wasn't a 1 or even a 5 or any of that malarkey.Another reviewer said that the first half was the more enjoyable half. I think that's probably true, though maybe because of the excitement and nostalgia factors gripping me to the screen. It felt a lot like the first matrix with plenty of 4th wall digs at Warner bros for forcing this to be made at all.I was a little disappointed when they didn't venture further into simulation theory which in my mind is exactly what the first half of the movie was building towards. I mean, the first matrix sparked a 20 year debate about simulation theory. How cool would it have been to have neo create a simulation of a simulation and for him to become the architect (I know that is technically what happened but it felt more like a footnote than a theme).Anyway, the movie was ok and it definitely feels like another sequel is the intention.One big thing though that lets it down a lot a is that many of the fight scenes were sadly quite terrible so if that's all you're hoping for in this movie then maybe a lower rating is valid. I was expecting something as good as the first matrix, especially since they even mentioned that they had to 'surpass bullet time' early in the movie. Instead, we had fight scenes where you couldn't see the punches land. A leaf from John wick's raw beatings would have been enough without trying to find some new CG to outdo bullet time.Overall, (mostly thanks to nostalgia) i'm happy this was made and I will likely watch it again and will eagerly await a sequel. Though I would say that this movie / universe would work well as a limited series in the age of streaming. Fingers crossed they get a handle on some of the let downs from this one.",6
4515,Well the movie forces you to remember the events of the trilogy but you'll happy for neo and trinity in the end. I wish they release matrix 5 in which neo and trinity both are finally ending the rule of machine over humanity and have a very good happy ending.,8
4516,"Been a member of IMDB for years but never posted a review. But this movie is so appallingly bad I feel the need to warn people. Some quotes from my son's to help illustrate 'the guy that plays Agent Smith would get excited by selling toilet paper', 'truly the worst 2 and a half hours of my life'.I honestly wonder how anyone at Hollywood would green light this movie, are the execs there really this stupid? Acting was wooden, plot was idiotic, action scenes repeatedly fell flat...I could go on.. Just save your money and time.. Avoid this movie.",1
4517,"The Matrix 1 is my top 5 best movies in all times, I loved 2 as well and 3 is like meh, still not horrible.But this one, straight off bad from the beginning. Everyone is like trying so hard to act serious, the casting of Jude and his co-workers felt very annoying, the whole movie is like a parody made by MTV back in the day with Justin Timberlake. The new Morpheus dresses like a clown, bright colored suits, dual wield every guns and just stands there and shoot, and saying the line from the old Morpheus.Also Keanu, what the hell happened to your acting... heartless, and why can't you cut your hair short and shave? The whole time I feel like watching John Wick, not The Matrix.This is a 2021 movie but somehow the graphics, fighting and VFX looks much better in 1999. Don't blame COVID on this, this whole movie is made with very low effort. Everything looks lazy, the fighting looks so light weighted with no speed.This is absolutely a quick cash grab and mocked the fans that went into the theater who loved this series, but not anymore, no more Wachoski movies for me.",2
4518,I'd say its 90% fan service that makes fun of itself and 10% that have _some_ potential for sequels to come.What i kind of liked was the whole meta story of lana you can clearly see every once in a while.The explanation for the ressurection is a joke though imo.In summary: a disappointment with hope.,3
4519,Not the same vibes you get watching the cyberpunk originals but your still going to watch like me it's a matrix movie you have too you don't have a choice.,6
4520,"WARNING, POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD.I'm picturing WB telling Lana Wachowski they want a new Matrix movie, she thinks it's a bad idea, she reads the script and it's crap. Well, Lana decided to take this bowl of crap, pour some more crap on top, and add a scene at the beginning saying that this is dedicated to everyone who loves to eat crap. And I applaud her for that.This movie is what happens and suits overcome artistic integrity. The only thing that saves it is the Meta approach at the beginning but, Lana could only do so much. If she would've had her way, this would have been a far better movie about how broken the entertainment industry ls.",6
4521,"Although many emotional moments fall flat - you have to appreciate the courage of the filmmakers for going meta, using the story from the real life - good performances, cinematography, all of that and most importantly a refreshingly different experience.",8
4522,"As a number 1# fan of the whole matrix trilogy, in which I have watched many times, this one was not that bad considering that neo and trinity are old. The movie is good but the story doesn't add anything to the first 3 movies, but all I can say is: at least I finally saw neo comes back after years and years of wanted to see a 4th one. Thank you for the movie.",7
4523,"I don't get the bad reviews. Was it more of the same? Yes. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. I enjoyed the entire film, only the ending scene was a bit cheesy for me.",8
4524,"The visionary ideas of the first matrix are very relevant today. Choosing to live in a virtual world rather than the real one, your digital avatar being different from your real self. Many of those themes about identity and reality resonate even more now than they did when the first movie came out.Unfortunately in this last movie they didn't elaborate on any of that. It's just the same old story again, just poorly told.Lana, of all people, could have made an interesting story about identity.As a fan, I'm saddened this movie has put a stain on the legacy of the otherwise (mostly) excellent trilogy. It doesn't add anything. It should not have been made. It's best to forget about it as soon as possible.",3
4525,"An absolute disgrace. A complete failure at every aspect of movie standars. Story is overcomplicated, casting is terrible, visual quality lacks quality compared to 1999. Also, there are a lot of cringe moments. Through the ending, the movie converts to Walking Dead, and the ending is like a scene from a 5.5 star romantic comedy. I am a huge Matrix fan and I wish I would never seen this movie. One of the biggest dissappointments of my life. I will try to recover from this trauma. Even 1 star is too much.",1
4526,"At least they treated the previous movies with respect. Overall the movie felt more like fan fiction. Pulled a few storylines hinted at in the Animatrix, which was nice to see.It was disappointing to see that none of the characters drove the story. They're always reacting to events. Neo wants to rescue Trinity, and suddenly the plot delivers circumstances to make it happen. If they continue the series, I hope they do something more. There was minimal virtue signaling, but it was evident in the casting choices and a few offhanded comments by the characters. The movie is kinda meh like a lot of things coming from hollywood these days. I feel bad for the actors.",4
4527,"I don t know why for bad reviews. I think it s a good movie. I think it s just beginning. :) maybe it will be more of that, maybe a new trilogy u never know....",8
4528,"For a stand-alone sequel to the original trilogy, I was impressed by how complete the movie felt.Did it blow my mind? No. Did it leave me satisfied and entertained? Yes.This movie was so tongue in cheek that they had to borrow my mouth for extra room. They made it obvious(very obvious) from the get go that this movie was never supposed to exist. For the entire first half of the movie, and then some. But still managed to make it feel like it belonged in the same reality as the previous films. Despite the change in tone.It takes itself less seriously, but I thought it worked.Tl;drDon't go into this movie expecting the same experience as the original. But it was a solid movie, which I found very entertaining. And that expanded the world in some very interesting directions. That being said, I hope they don't make another one.",7
4529,"Giving this a 10 to compensate for the inappropriate low ratings -This review is for my fellow fans who love the matrix, but we're disappointed by its 3rd installment:They successfully evolved the story, checking all the boxes for what the fans expect.Enjoy the ride.",10
4530,"Such a disappointment. I was expecting something groundbreaking like the original. They just took all the cool shots from the original movie and put them in like i'm supposed to be excited to see the same thing. Great to see Carrie-Ann Moss again, however movie was full of bad action scenes where all the thousands of bad guys had really bad aim.",5
4531,"Not a good movie seems to meander quite a bit. The agents in the originals were a genuine threat to the protagonists in this abomination they are incompetent buffoons that only slow down the strong female protagonist. Movies 20 years ago were written by people that lived life had struggles, failings. The current movies are written by people that had life given to them so they can't understand the struggle of life. Disgusting abomination I hope they don't make any others and I will forget what I've seen and go back to considering the original Matrix as the only canon film.",1
4532,"This whole movie is more like a school reunion. After 20 years they all meet each other again and start remembering te past. Especially the first part of the movie is copying the past and getting flashbacks to the ""Good old days""After the last Matrix the question has always been what happened to Neo, was he dead or not? And what happened after peace was made because of Neo? In this movie they try to give an answer to these question, but did they do a good job?The questions form the previous ending have been answered. But was this done in a good way? The story is essentially not even bad, but at some points it's losing itself by overcomplicating the story. This with the different actors for Morpheus and Smith and the constant flashbacks makes it look like a cheap ripoff because they couldn't get the original cast together anymore.",5
4533,Lack of action but story was good. All the emotions are got fullfil in this part. In 1999 it was a super movie but in 2021 it is not matched up because of their last part was in 2003 . They want to keep the same story line and same fighting styles that's why it looks like old fashion.,10
4534,"22 years after the revolutionary release of ""The Matrix"", Lana Wachowski triumphantly returns to the franchise and flips it on its head. While Keanu Reeves has been on a downturn recently (do we really need more John Wick movies?), Reeves delivers the best performance of his career and potentially of the 21st century. Truly his magnum opus.The Matrix Resurrections has made me believe in cinema again after the disappointing conclusion to the original trilogy.Side Note: The recasting of Agent Smith and Morpheus, while daring, was inspired. It truly was the right call to not utilize the talents of Laurence Fishburn and Hugo Weaving.",10
4535,"I will start with how ridiculous the last series of something which was ahead of its time can be ( reminds me of Prison Break the last season ,created several years later after the original series ended )They rushed the film so much, so it chaotic, mixed nonsense, complete joke , if there were not the previous series this would easily go to the Avengers type of films !I won't follow the storyline in the next lines, but there are so many things which are not only cringe ,but stupidly made, like you are watching Avengers or some sort of Marvel's movie for kids which are 14-16 years old.I dont want to mention the humour which is WORSE than a stand up comedy show ( most memorable are Morpheus' lame jokes ,like literally are more cringe than everything) !So :-Agent Smith from enemy, suddenly becomes a friend-Machines (the allies) are designed like characters from BABY TV ( no time to explain why they are only 3 machines on the side of the humans, it is just 150 mins film )-Neo trying to fly and quits after the first attempt, but Trinity can so why he would keep trying in these 2 and a half hours movie instead of using her for a lift !-it's Bots ,not Agents and they act like you are watching a brainless Zombie film, never watched that joke Walking dead but similar to it-150mins rushed into a film, where 20% is old footage from 1999 ,and there is so much unexplained ,not that even they had bothered explaining it would change anything-the cast are bunch of kids ( early 20s) ,hardcore fans of Neo and they contribute nothing to the whole fight (agent Smith did more ) nor to the film itselfAnd that is what it comes from top of my head, you dont have to burden yourself with this film and think deeply into it , obviously made only to suck some money not to leave a mark in the industy!I am doing this review in the name of how something so great (the greatest ) that was 20 years ago , can turn into a mix of Avengers, Walking dead ,The Guardians of the Galaxy , Baby TV and I am sure you can add more ridiculous shows from your perspective !!!So for 2021 is not full waste of time, like most of the films they create nowadays , but it is somewhere there.",4
4536,"I thought the Third installment was bad. I wish they had just ended with the that film. I was hopeful the filmmakers were hoping to give the fans a solid ending to a great franchise and redemption for the third Matrix movie. This was such a let down. Bad writing, horrible plot that was basically impossible to follow. Almost no action. Just a disappointment all around. Future generations should just watch the first two films and leave it there.",4
4537,I wish this movie had never been made . Choosing wrong actorsGreen vintage theme wasn't hereMusic was badThere is nothing to showI wish I had never watched itI hate it.,2
4538,"I'm not a hardcore matrix fan but for me this movie was enjoyable to watch.But to understand what's going on, at least you need to watch the first Matrix. If not, then you will be utterly confused.",10
4539,"I for some reason didnt expect much to be honest.. but i was pleasantly surprised at this film.. the story was good and the way it handled bringing them back to life and recasting some characters..the effects were great and i liked how they used the whole loop way of shooting the film.I thought the flashbacks were a good choice of retelling the same story but in a way different..its a good edition to the universe.. (me being a fan of all three movies, the animatrix and the games..)Watch it and make your own mind up.. but then again do you really have a choice..;)",8
4540,Where to start the best movie liked how they connected this one with the past 3 movies good graphics real nice story telling good action scenes and fights.,10
4541,"So the phenomena around 'The Matrix Resurrections' is a deja-vu indeed; it reminds me of how 'Twin Peaks: The Return' was treated by some. It might not be what some fans longed for (although I think if anything, this is pretty mich it) but that alone doesn't make it bad. On the contrary, it dares to be new, self-ironic even, while it's action packed, looks great while remaining fun and nostalgic to watch to the end. The dialogues are dull sometimes, and all-in-all it's a Hollywood blockbuster, but a great one at that. Definitely not as groundbreaking as the first one, but takes a solid second place on the podium. Do not really understand the fuss about it.",8
4542,"I was really looking forward to this, It's a shame this movie failed on so many levels. An obvious nostalgia play. There are a few incoherent plot devices pieced together that never really get fleshed out. Had they taken the time to explore any of the directions they tried to go it might have worked out better.Aside from the plot being pieced together the characters are nothing special, the action sequences are choppy, and like most movies they just fail to set any real consequences or reason to care who wins in the end.Worth a watch if your a fan of the original, just go into it not expecting much.",4
4543,"I understand it starts slow, but they are starting the series again and bringing back Neo and Trinity. Go in with expectations this is the ground of the building being set to come back with a bang and the fight against the machines coming back alive. I liked the movie and setting of the stage for the battle to once again begin. The machines are going to regret saving them both thinking they could control them!",8
4544,"Literally every frame or scene refers to the trilogy. Many dialogues are based on familiar quotes and remind of old conversations. The design of the environment and, in general, the objects in the frame work in the same direction.It is clear that Wachowski created ""Resurrection"" with love. She still remembers her work and tries to refer to it as often as possible through the fourth part.And sometimes it happens with humor, and sometimes with a hard pop of surprise in the brain. The director skillfully manipulates emotions and tries to surprise with plot twists until the end of the film.However, skepticism from the existence of the film still remained. After all, the original trilogy of The Matrix is considered a complete and very dark work.The whole thrill of The Matrix was that it showed real cyberpunk. It's a dark, terrible future that none of us want to be in. Machines have taken over the planet and are raising people for food, the survivors huddle underground and eat some kind of slop to survive. Everyone hopes only for a miracle and some freak who does not believe in his own strength. From such a reality, I would definitely want to escape into a technological matrix in order to live a quiet life, be a famous actor and eat steaks on weekends.And in the ""Resurrection"" of all this grotesque ... is not felt. Everything has become brighter and more positive here. Naturally, everything is very beautiful, including because of the graphics, but the general style of narration also plays a big role. Let's say this - in the fourth ""Matrix"", the same sense of calm appeared around, which no film allowed itself.There is no ruined Zion in which people slept on the cold floor and crawled through the sewers, there is no sense of danger that penetrated the viewer through and through during the trilogy. There is a sense of hope, which, although huddled in the hearts of the inhabitants of the underground city, looked like a dream. Here it was fulfilled.The whole mood of the film is no longer about war, poverty and grief. More sincere and warm feelings come to the fore: love, trust, hope. Here, many dialogues, mini-plots and even a few cameos are based on this.As a fan, the film aroused only positive emotions in me. It was created for me, here every frame reminds me of my favorite events, brings me back to childhood with familiar images. It's not just a cool action movie with Keanu Reeves. This is the real fourth ""Matrix"", which wants more. All fans must go.",8
4545,"I don't know how was this even possible, but Lana Wachowski managed to completely ruin something that was really dear part of my life.The Matrix was always something special. The whole story about AI, control, everything the first movie touched on is actually still very interesting and relevant. Not to mention the visual and sound effects that were just ahead of their time.To turn that into something so bad is actually sad. I am not even mad. Just sad.I honestly regret watching it.It would've been so much better for me if I just never watched this one. Do yourself a favor and ""save your Matrix"" by not watching this sad pile of junk.The Matrix has died.Thank you for all the amazing memories.",1
4546,"The movie was really bad compared to the old ones .. what a shame ..Morpheus from last generations would have helped the movie a little at least.They didnt use the essence of the old movies and its really sad, hope theyll fix it.",1
4547,"There's an adage that reflects a whole genre of adages that apply here, ""You can never step into the same book twice."" And thank goodness for that.There are two ways that this could have gone.Number one, they could have looked at what everyone loved about the first movie-since most people are a bit lukewarm on 2 &amp; 3-and tried to recreate that. Probably disappoint fans all the same.Number two, they could have looked at what made the first movie great, namely speaking to the times and giving visual representation of the tension between the ""real world"" and the digital one, add philosophy and some super cool visual effects and bond all of that to some action, put in a bit of future speculation as a bit of a cautionary tale.Thank goodness they chose the latter. They also had the good sense to respect their own work in 2 &amp; 3 and not try to pretend those movies didn't happen. (I'm looking at you, X-Men franchise.)Then they also stepped into a lineage of important movies and series that are sometimes panned and sometimes loved. Return to Oz. The Robocop reboot. Twin Peaks: The Return. All of these other works similarly tried to pick up on a previously monumental success of beloved stories. They all also interacted with the original material and/or ideas but through a lens that allows for change and decay and..gasp...a sense that things could look different in modern times through all the cultural events and shifts in the times since we were first enchanted.For my money, the way that Twin Peaks went extremely dark and gritty compared to Seasons one and two is the exact reason that I don't mind The Matrix Resurrections spending time in self-doubt and lots of talking. This is a movie that takes itself seriously in its presence in this moment of this civilization. It addresses fan theory of the originals, it goes into the complexity of armistices and the complicated peace within. It deals with the digital landscape that we are in, right down to weaponizing individuals for the sake of an agenda (differently than Agent Smith or the agents in general). It also contorts enough to be self-aware to the point of addressing cash grabs and the entertainment industry's drive to produce and devour material originators in a less than subtle address to Warner Brothers.It also speaks to the zeitgeist of anxiety, depression, impostor syndrome, and the strength of the digital world in our daily lives. And it does it with the grace that doesn't tolerate the black and white lines of humans as good and machines are evil. It instead allows for gray area in our gray matter. Which in the hyperpolarized era that we're in is not an easy approach to pull off.Is this movie a little sleepy? Yes. Are they making money off of established audiences? Yes. Is there less action? Yes. And here's a hot take: That's ok.This movie pulls off what it attempts: to be fresh in its fatigue, and to stay true to itself even when it's hard to know if anything is true at all. It's great because it doesn't try to be who it was. It tries to become what it is. And I for one am here for it.",8
4548,"It was okay. A very slow and unclear story line for the first half or more of the movie. Making it a bit confusing. Then... the cast was very diffrent. Only Neo and Trinity being the same. The other actors where good, don't get me wrong. I liked them, however, just not the same and made the confusion worse. Just an all around unnecessary movie I guess.",7
4549,It wasn't a bad movie but it didn't feel like the Matrix. The idea was smart but I feel like the writers got lazy. There wasn't enough conflict but maybe a sequel will fix that.,6
4550,"Just don't watch this movie, please don't. I wanted to really like it, the trailer seemed cool. Entered the logo for Warner Brother and I was excited. ""Will this deliver the same feelings I had when I saw the first, and even some parts of the sequels (which were not a bad now compared with this one)? Will it make me go throughout the whole internet searching for theories and whatnot?""Well, It sure made me go to the internet, just to warn people against this piece of digital crap. I never thought I would ever feel bored or sleepy during a movie of this sort. It's a ""travesti"" of a movie (probably pun intended, and will probably be canceled for it). Hell, it's not even a movie. It's several ideas stitched together in a rush to make it look like a movie. ""Hey the movie is meta, etc etc"", whatever, make it what you want, but at least make it entertaining, which was not.I know a little of CGI, and I felt that the one they delivered was done in a old version of Blender (free 3D software) by interns badly paid and eager to work on a matrix movie whatever the cost.The actors were horrible, It got to the point that I wouldn't even mind that the machines or the agents would kill them all, and that would have been a much better movie. The love story was contrived, the whole purpose of it was idiotic like a product of preteen that's entering it's teenager years and writing fan fiction. Lawrence Fishburn and Hugo weaving surely dodged the bullet this time, and they didn't even need to resort to bullet time, good for them.The Wachowskis now look like one of those one hit wonders that will disappear in history, only to be remembered by one song, their ""Woman in Red""",4
4551,"REALLY BAD, IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE STAYED FOR TWO HOURS LOOKING AT THE TV TURNED OFF, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS MOVIE, THE WORST MATRIX BY FAR.",5
4552,"It is soooo painful to watch both talents wasted in this film. OMG. The storyline is horrible. For a second, I thought I was watching The rise of Skywalker....... Neo and Trinity needs to be together to generate enough power??! Oh wait it is also the line for Monster Inc. 🤣 Who wrote this, really??",4
4553,"From reading other reviews, I think some people need to adjust their expectations. Matrix 1 was groundbreaking, so much so that matrix 2 and 3 were already disappointments to many fans.You can't have every movie installment be groundbreaking in the same way guys.I thoroughly loved this sequel. It continues the story from the first 3 movies and gives closure in a way.It's not a 10 like the first movie, but a solid 8 in my book given the contraints.",8
4554,"The Matrix ResurrectionsAs soon as the opening musical queue was struck and the titles began to fill the screen with the infamous green scrolling code, I was filled with joy.However, it was the opening shot that let me know that this was going to be a well executed ride. Director Lana Wachowski and her team have devised such a clever re-entry into this amazing world. This is a very meta and self-referential film, that begs us to look at the current state of the cinema landscape. Using its own position as a new entry of a major franchise to put a mirror to the necessity of sequels and reboots.Keanu Reeves is firing on all cylinders, displaying his talents as a very lost and lonely Thomas Anderson/Neo. Carrie-Anne Moss has lost a bit of her coolness and she shines once again as Tiffany/Trinity. Returning cast and newcomers were all welcome editions for me.I throughly enjoyed the film (script, action, effects, music, and ending). This film sticks its landing. The Matrix Resurrections knows the type of film it is and Lana Wachcowski delivers it up and spades.It was nice to see some old cinematic friends, and to go on this adventure. It's an adventure I will gladly revisit and explore deeper, as all the films in the franchise demand.",8
4555,"I don't know where to start to make this review...First of all, the background story of the ressurection doesn't make any sense...I won't make too much spoiler here but there is no sense at all why machines kept them alive - romance energy come on! Neo spent years to expand his power and trinity in a blink of the eyes, computer effects very boring (2003 effects), 40min quoting the movies doesn count like a new movie, people shouldn't try to break a trilogy if 18yrs later they can't figure out a good sequence of events or a stroy which makes sense. Fuly disappointed...Bad actors, bad directing, bad compute effects, no special sounds, no new fighting scenes (copy of the original), no clever script lines,no photography, you name it...Bad ,horrible movie...If you are really like matrix you will be fully disappointed 😞 too.",2
4556,"This is an overview of what you obviously missed. Symbolism. From the name of the company to all the little Easter eggs. Is it original? Obviously not. It's more of a summary with a conclusion. Did the film have to be made, certainly not. I accredit my score with the notion of entertainment. It did as it should ""free your mind"". Don't be a blatant jerk about it, it was enjoyable.",7
4557,"The internet is full of these smug individuals that would have no idea how to make a film like Resurrections. These same armchair critics contribute nothing to film other than a vapid commentary on popular culture.Matrix 4 delivers a veneer of mindless action for the following:The sheeple (that don't know any better).The clueless film executive that needs to tick the boxes.The emotional internet nerd incapable of embracing anything that doesn't align with their fanboy principles.Standing in the shadows of this veneer is a series of high concept ideas reminiscent of Marinetti's manifesto during the Italian futurism movement. All these ideas get overlooked because the copper-tops are more concerned with the whereabouts of Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Anyone with half a brain knows Lana Wachowski loves original and unique ideas. All of the Wachowski's previous efforts have been original IP's that sadly were ignored by mainstream audiences. This would naturally motivate her to cynically refurbish older Matrix scenes to comment on the lack of advancement in the film industry. Ultimately this film immerses you so much that you question its legitimacy as a piece of art. Ironically, the creators are aware of this because of the film's simultaneous blend of obvious inauthenticity with ambiguous authenticity.Beyond the story and characters Matrix 4 shines as a film that challenges the viewer to independently decipher its merits instead of falling victim to what the algorithm tells you is good.",8
4558,Horrible nostalgic money grab. Do not waste your time. I made an account just to make a comment on how bad this movie was. Huge fan of the original series. This is not that.,2
4559,"Honestly, if you are not a fan of the previous trilogy you shouldn't watch this. The nolstagia and meta aspects of the matrix refer to the previous matrix. The movies and the world. They reenact scenes because the matrix has memories of the previous scenes. One can say this just for nolstagia cash grab but its part of the matrix itself. I loved the expositional techno mumbles about free will as all red pills. Neil P. H was an awesome addition to this world, an upgrade from the architect in the trilogy to as analyst.. all I wanna say as fan you should check this out..",9
4560,This suffers from the same problem so many movies do when they're a sequel. The belief that more is more.Less is more.What was more exciting to watch? Neo and Trinity fighting off a small handful of security guards in the first movie or watching Neo fight 11 trillion Agent Smiths in the 3rd movie?Every fight scene in this movie is half a dozen people fighting off 11 trillion bad guys. There's no time to enjoy each 0.0005 second fight.,6
4561,"I've enjoyed the Mayeix movies for their originality, but the message of Resurrections is so important to every age. How easy it is to slip back into what we find comfortable and easy, even when we don't really want to be there. How we convince ourselves that it's okay. I loved the evolution of the characters, the new characters and the story. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Also, make sure to watch the final credit scene, hysterical!!",9
4562,"The reviews that suggest this is a terrible or great film are just not balanced. This is a good film.It provides a reasonable explanation for how Neo and Trinity are back and introduces some new likable characters, including the new Agent Smith. The action sequences are all well executed and exciting to watch.This films one key flaw in my opinion was the last 7 minutes of the film in the role that Trinity plays. It honestly moved my rating from an 8 to a 7. I hope they make a sequel to this new iteration, but am honestly worried that this ending may leave a bad taste in the mouth of too many people and make a follow up in this story line not palatable for most of the franchises fans.",7
4563,"Spiderman No Way Home had a good reason to bring back nostalgia but this didn't have a good enough reason.....I'm disappointed with the casting choices.Morpheus &amp; Agent Smith that doesn't feel like Agent Smith at all. They could've just cast them as new characters so they don't have to be compared with the OGs.The martial arts, gun shooting, bullet time, flashy fashion and camera angles is what makes Matrix franchise stand out. And they were a game changer back in early 2000s. So much that other movies copied and parodied them. But for Resurrections, the martial arts weren't clean and smooth like butter. It was all choppy, short, and kinda copying what they did before but making the scenes shorter. I know Keanu is aging but at least John Wick martial arts were a lot better. I don't understand why they couldn't make it the standard. There is no new bullet time technology. Nothing innovative that stands out.I hate to give my beloved movie of all time a low score. But when the original trilogy gave us so much, this movie is just another plain action movie. Worse than Revolutions.Ps. From what I read about WB , they were relentlessly bugging original Wachoskis to keep making Matrix movies after the success of the trilogy and they kept saying no, and that it's done. WB would then have to find other directors to direct it anyway. Lana finally said yes after her parents died, and came up with a story to resurrect her loved ones.

4564,"Amazing, still carry the philosophy, I saw the rabbit hole before and now I had flashbacks which you don't have, that is why you don't like the movie because it is not a movie, beyond it.",10
4565,"I'd been waiting for a Matrix sequel for a long time. The fact that it took so long, also meant they had to explain the time that had past. Now this is done I'm really hoping WB isn't backing down and produces a Matrix 5.",7
4566,"Matrix Resurrection has received mixed reviews from ""critics"", maybe because it resurrects the idea of the first movie, where we are reminded that most people don't really want to be free, but prefer to live in a permanent state between fear and hope, dreaming of a better life. More than ever one could draw a parallel to the present time, where we areartificially being induced with fear and occasionally given hope, to see better times, just to return us back to the beginning of this loop and make us anxious with a new threat. People who watched the movie, identifying themselves with the resistance, with those who has awaken from the ""Matrix"", may think that the government is on their side and wish them well and that forceful vaccination of the whole population is the only solution to our situation, that restrictions to our movement and actions is just a side effect, which will disappear as soon as everyone is on the same page and do as they are told. People who hold those or similar opinions, in reality, are the very crowd that blindly follows the global programming, and the real resistance are those who dare to confront the regime and total and totalitarian control of the entire population in the real world.",10
4567,"Hair style is a matter of taste.Some might like busy, but simple, colourful but messy.If you have not seen the first Matrix and you're expecting a good action movie, you might enjoy what you're about to see.The second and third Matrix were a money grab. They had little of the first movie's finesse: the dialogues, fights, pace and the message to convey.Lana had a lot of time to think of a good story, to sell it to the producers, but what they really needed was time for us to forget about the latex soft porn that second and third Matrix were.People dangling on strings and spinning after barely being touched. The slappy mockery of a fight you could admire in first Matrix. The rant of a dialogue instead of neatly composed, climax building, scarce but meaningful lines that make the 1st Matrix appeal to so many...If the second Matrix was the first, this would be a fitting ending of a trilogy.Sadly, we've been treated to the first one first and anything that came afterwards feels like it was made by a completely different crew.",3
4568,Just why ? People saying that this feels like a matrix parody ! Thats exactly how I felt ! Why would you ruin something that was so beautiful ? I have never written a story and Im 100% sure that I couldve written a better one ! And the fighting scenes were terrible ! Big disappointment.,3
4569,"I must disagree. Johnny Menomic 4 is the best in the series. After pulling me back into the idea of the Matrix the movies turns and twists had me riveted. Lara Shawarski had me wishing I had just rewatched the original Matrix. The Ewoks seen was the highlight of the movie where they captured the tractor beam. Duggie Howziers villianess roll has me having nightmares till today, Barney has performed up to par. I am in anticipation of Lara Sawarskis next Johnny Menomic to see the rest of the story. Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure is a must see for all as John Wick puts on a performance of a life time. No I haven't been drinkining.",4

4571,"Glad to see some new scenes of The Matrix series, but it's more like The John Wicktrix than The Matrix.Focusing on the action scenes which were not as good as they were in the previous moviesput agent Smith aside from the polt although he was one of the main charactersNot enough philosophical conversations and messages as there were before.",7
4572,"First of all it was a real treat to see most of the original cast together again. I loved the metanarrative and I feel like the premise of the matrix is as current as it was all those years ago. Then again I was quite disappointed by the repetitive fighting scenes, like okay he can stop bulllets, we get it, and all the new technological mumbo jumbo. But what I found the most disappointing was that they chose action (or explanations) above exploring the depth of personal choices of the characters. Why didn't Neo want to break out of the matrix? And why didn't they put in an actual choice like: Trinity not wanting to leave her kids in the matrix and Neo then having to choose between reality and love. Because isn't that what most of us have to do on a daily basis in one way or another. Choosing hope and love over disappointing reality. Maybe I wanted it to be something it's not but I seem to recall more inner struggle in the first movie than there was here and to be frank: that's what storytelling is all about.",7
4573,"The continuation of the story was amazing. Humans and machines working together was an amazing concept. The discussion's among the creative guy's was rather foolish, it shouldn't be in the movie. All that is back office stuff pointless taking up the movie's time.",8
4574,"First time I watched it I didnt know how to feel about the film, but the second time it got really good. Not a perfect film but worthy of The Matrix. Everyones entitled to have their opinon :)",10
4575,"Just watched it yesterday night like it was for me Matrix 3 happened just last week. Much lesser action, Neo is just like waving new chi4 in the movie. (they introduced new stuff but not much fighting, and not so exciting like the last time you saw it).This movie referenced a lot on the old movies, but it's like a joke to make a parody out of the old movies. They brought Naomi, Morpheus and the Merovingian(aka the French guy), everybody turns out to be older 60 years, they explained why Neo and Trinity was younger because the machines repaired them and introduced some Sentient beings which helps the humans now after Neo went missing after episode 3.Again they put Neo into sleep(actual body) after reviving Neo and Trinity, Neo ends up losing his memories, and turns out to be a game programmer who programmed ""Matrix games"" in the Matrix World. Nobody can find him after 60 years after he went missing in ep3.And the machines needed just Neo and Trinity to produce a more powerful energy.Neo was trapped in the Matrix because of Trinity and Neo went in back to save Trinity. It sounds so cliche, they bring in new elements, now you don't need the telephone booth, they have access to the key maker by hacking, bullet time is even slower now by 1/1000 and Neo doesn't have the power to overcome it, every captain is new and character is new, it's so difficult to understand it. Jessica Heinwick's English is difficult to understand but her blue hair stands out. It's more of a woman empowerment movie to me.Suddenly Trinity gains powers, Naomi became the lead, no reminiscence between Morpheus and Naomi, there's so many disconnections out there.All is just about Neo losing power to fly, and end up in the new OS (Matrix), and Trinity suddenly awakens to be Neo and saved by the crew members. Now she can fly and do most of the things.This movie, it tries to be an ending episode of Matrix, but I think trilogies are the best where it ends at 3. Just like Ironman, just like Lord of the rings, just like Twilight except if you are Harry Potter, you can make 7 movies. But the point is, don't ruin your own childhood or teenage, just enjoy it like a separate movie.",4
4576,"Movie is a bit of a waste of time. Doesn't add anything to the original trilogy, and I had to fast forward on a few scenes that were just unwatchable like the meeting to discuss the Matrix IV game sequel. Overall, script leaves much to be desired. I can see this becoming like the Terminator franchise, hitting new lows at each iteration.",2
4577,"I can't believe what lana wachowski done with the matrix franchise, the new episode is disaster it is look like a joke i wish you did not make the new episode she destroy all credentials from previous episodes.",1
4578,"Absolutely astonishing, fresh, courageous and ironic version of Matrix. Lana is super intelligent film maker. For me it was a pure pleasure. I am the fan of the previous trilogy, and I was not disappointed at all. It had to be new. It is 2021.",10
4579,"I just got done watching The Matrix Resurrections- the one that just released and I wanted to tell you all that despite what you may read from the critics, this movie was amazing.THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE DISLIKE IT SO MUCH IS BECAUSE IT WAS SHOT DIFFERENTLY THAN THE OTHERS (which was stated by Keanu in interviews).The overall feeling through out the movie of transitional familiarity, repeating loops, patterns through out the world that everyone sees but doesn't realize.. it's intense.I have to say it is by far one of the better filmsout of the whole series and I was mind blownthe whole way through it ties up a lot of onanswered questions and also delves intowhat happened in the meantime betweenThe matrix revolutions and this current film italso goes into detail further to explain the loreand what happened after the machines in thehumans made a truce.I don't want to spoil anything for anyone planning on seeing it, but, it is everything you could want in a modern day sci-fi, psychological, action movie. It also ties up a lot of unanswered questions and loose ends that anyone had about the Matrix lore.10/10.",10
4580,"From the moment I saw the trailers I knew this was going to be a nostalgia baited cash grab but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. And was disappointed far greater than I thought I would be, the scene where they are in the board room talking about the matrix ""video game"" absolutely pissed me off because all they did was, in the most arrogant way stroke their own ego. And honestly it felt like a slap in the face for someone who loved the trilogy. Contrary to popular opinion I think Reload and Revolutions were both beautiful expansions of the first movie that felt like the picked up right where the first stopped and had a satisfying ending to the franchise. But this film was something no one wanted, felt like it made fun of itself, mocked the viewers in every way possible and I'm irritated that this was even made. I've definitely lost respect for the wachowski's after this.",1
4581,"The only thing stands-out in the movie is the flashback scenes from original Matrix. Weak story, poor screenplay, sub-optimal graphics.. so no soul basically!",2
4582,"This is a much better movie if you view it as a middle finger to the studio and mocking Hollywood reboots, wokeness and trash sequels. LolThe Code AwakensAn excellent parody .",6
4583,"Hm...soI always like a sci-fi movie so I enjoyed this without thinking about the original trilogy.It seemed though like one of those movies made by Amazon or Netflix. Not much substance just purely made for entertainment and of course money.As always it was too much hyped and not rising to expectations as many sequels made after so many years from the originals.Didn't quite feel like it had any of the Matrix philosophy left in it.Felt just like a cheesy love story not well developed either, on a sci-fi background. Not unlike a telenovela, having the twist of resurrecting some characters just for the sake of it.Unfortunately it didn't have the high stakes of the trilogy. I didn't feel like there was any real danger or concern for human survival.It was basically just software war mostly not machines vs humans.Not even the great fight scenes and effects of the originals.Not to mention the lack of mystery to it all and suspense.Actors great as usual but recycled ideas for a cash grab at the fans expense.Probably the pitch meeting for this will be way better than the movie(for those who know what I'm talking about 🙂).Really it's a 6 or 7 rating movie.I respect the actors so I gave 8 and also because I am a sci-fi fan.It was entertaining but less than expected.",8
4584,"Thx for the fans and thx for Neo and Trinity, they deserved not to end in M 3. This reboot is very good in my opinion. New chars are also very interesting and i can totaly see a new trilogy very successful.",10
4585,"If you prefer your movie easy to understand, if you need every plot point explained, dialog simplified and redundant, and nuance is lost on you stick to the comicbook movies.",8
4586,"I was super excited to see this film. The movie started and, while watching it, I could only feel an intense discomfort. I couldn't recognise the ""matrix atmosphere ""; there was something strange with Thomas Anderson/Neo and Tiffany/Trinity. I could not understand the reason for that feeling. At some point, I felt like leaving the screen room...After a while, I realised: this isn't the same matrix. It is a new version, built by a new architect. So, I opened my mind and dove into the white rabbit hole.I was not a masterpiece, but it has some great ideas, new concepts, and I could not stop thinking about the movie.If you hated the film, give it another chance.",6
4587,"This is what happens when you don't have people around you letting you know the truth and when something just isn't right.Lana Wachowski definitely needed people around her letting her know that the direction she was going in was completely off and that the public will not like this version.After watching this film I was left thinking ""was that just a big joke!?"" Anyone that is a fan of the trilogy will probably agree that this isn't the direction we expected. This was more like an extended episode of the Sense8 series.I can't really think of a good thing about it. Such a shame.",4
4588,"Man, i loved this franchise, infact i still love the original Matrix Trilogy And Keanu Reeves, ofcourse, that's why i have even rated it 4. (Doesn't even deserve this)I had big hopes with this movie, same as any other Matrix fan, but man has this shattered 'em all.I mean repeating the story was okay, but com'on you could've done better with the 2nd half.Then comes the casting, i mean, really...I get it Lawrence Fishburne ain't fit enough to pull off Morpheus, but that's where CGI, VFX come in, stuntmen come in...This whole new cast, has also brought a whole new level of disappointment. I mean, Hugo Weaving is replaced by some unknown guy, to play Agent Smith... Com'on man!Ain't worth the watch, had high hopes, all went down into the gutter.",6
4589,"1 / 10Movie is horrible !I am a fan of the series specially the first one but obviously, this is a money grab, lazy writing, recycled plot.Like swiss cheese this movie is full of holes nothing new and original just one last money to squeeze a few more dollars based on the first movie, do not pay to watch this movie it is super boring, kind of movie you can play at night to go to sleep.",1

4592,"The first hour is a fast-paced, post modern blast. Second hour is a call back to previous sequels and their tendency to explain too much for too long and leave too many questions and me on the verge of sleep. Then, the last hour is a choreographers nightmare made into pure eye candy with some classic action tropes and chase scene call backs to previous movies.All in all, it was fine.",6
4593,All I can say is that it was not as bad as I thought it would be. Could it have been better? Yes. To me the movie in parts seemed rushed. I am a hardcore Matrix fan.,8
4594,"Obviously not as good as the first one but definitely better than the sequels, this movie tries something different and it succeeds at delivering. The reviews are polarising and i think that it is part of the purpose of the fourth installment.",7

My daughter loves it too.",9
4596,"20 years ago The Matrix blew my mind. But then again 20 years ago we all had Nokia phones, we used MySpace and the fax machine was still standard office equipment. I love nostalgia but this was just sad on so many levels. Opportunity missed. Not worth your time, nor corrupting your memory of the original movie. Hard pass.",3
4597,I saw this movie with an open mind. This said I have to tell all the purists that if you wanted to see another Neo against the machines movie well then you should watch the first trilogy again and again until you die.This new movie gives a good following of where the last movie ended. Explains a lot and brings old and new characters to the trama. You can see how things change during time.I Have to tell you... I liked this movie. Just keep an open mind.,8
4598,I am a huge matrix fan but this movie left me empty . This part has a storyline but does not come with the similiar action and thrill what we used to from the previous series. Long and boring conversations alongside with some ridiculous characthers like morpheus. I think it was overhyped and does not meet with my expectation unfortunately. Also really missed that surreal greyish greenish filter from the move. Its not a matrix movie anymore.doesnt recommend it. If you are a matrix fan just watch it and put aside on the shelf !!!,
4599,"The first Matrix movie is Still the best of all. But here's what I don't understand... At the end of the very first Matrix movie, Neo gets that Trinity loves him. He really ""gets"" it. This is what brings him back from being pummeled with lead by Smith in that hallway. No one comes back from that! But he just did! He comes to and stands. First real evidence for Neo that he is the ""One"". Also, first evidence that he has overcome the laws of physics in the Matrix. He sees the Matrix for what it is... an illusion.Second evidence... Smith and his two buddies see Neo stand and start firing at him. Neo says, No."" Turns his head and stops the bullets. No ones ever done that! He looks curiously at one of the slugs and then they all fall to the floor. No one has ever done that.Third evidence... Smith is pissed and charges Neo. He fights with all he has but Neo just turns to one side and fends off Smith with one hand. Then kicks the crap out of Smith, sending him flying down the hall! No one has ever done that!Fourth evidence... Neo runs at them and takes a flying leap and dives right into Smith! Moves all around inside Smith and finally makes him explode! No one has ever done that to an agent. Totally outside the laws of physics in the Matrix. The other two agents turn and run! No one has ever made an agent run away!Then, at the very end, at the phone booth, Neo says, ""I didn't come here to tell you how this will end. I came here to tell you how it will begin."" Then he steps out of the phone booth, looks up and Rockets right up into the sky! Neo Can Fly!With me so far? So... how come in the sequels, ""it"" never began? Nothing began! Not in the second or third sequel. It was Still a constant battle! Even though Neo had come back to life, stopped bullets with his mind, beaten the worst agent to pieces and flew like a rocket, None of these abilities seemed to make any difference. It's like all that realization was for Nothing! And then, he and Trinity... die. Pfft.So now, in this forth installment, even though he starts to remember what he knew, he Still struggles with crowds of agents and has to run away. He can explode the dojo. He can stop bullets. But he can't fly? Why does the Wachowski chick think it necessary to make Neo so forgetful and weak? I mean, if she's going to bring him back at all, why not make him the guy he was at the end of the first movie and beat the crap out of the agents like he did Smith? And why not at least three quarters of the way through this forth movie if not half way? I Wanted To See Neo Kick Some Serious Agent Butt!!! But noooooo!Wachowski didn't seem to get that this what we all want to see. We want to see Neo Win! What's her problem?!?So instead of 7 or 8 or 9 stars, she's averaging 6 at best and that might drop as more people realize what she's done to Neo. IF... if she decides to make another, I hope she makes Neo and Trinity the hero's we all want to see. At least that's what I want to see. Less total chaos and confusion and some serious agent butt kicking, more flying and general Winning for a change!Very disappointed in this one.Oh, and BTW, it was not a total loss at the end because it seems Trinity finally got ""it"". And this helped Neo to finally get ""it"" too. But not until the last 5 minutes of a 2 1/2 hour movie? Sheesh!But that wasn't enough of a let down. Then there was the piece of crap girl rapper when the credits started... OMG. The Worst thing to have to listen to after another disappointing Matrix movie. When she was done ranting and raving, the real music started. Could totally have done without that chick rapper.And a PS? Yes, there is a short clip at the very end of the credits. Totally pointless. The same bunch of boneheads talking about making the Matrix game in the beginning of the movie? They talk about the cat in it and make a bad joke about making a game called, ""The Catrix"". And that was the end. Not even worth the wait. Ugh!Us real fans of the Matrix waited years for the next one and the best they could do at the end was to reference cat videos like on Youtube? Because that's what came to my mind when they said that. Is this disrespecting the movie? Or us fans? Or both? Absolutely Lame. 6 stars. And that's me being generous because I loved the first one so much. At least Wachowski got that one right.Based on the end of this one, she might have one more in her. If so, I really hope she wakes up and makes the Matrix movie we fans were hoping for This time! Not another Wachowski mental breakdown. One winner out of four is Not beating the odds, lady. -_-",6
4600,"The Matrix Resurrection was complete trash, I do not recommend this movie garbage to anyone.The story makes no sense, the fight scenes look amateur at best and the ending is utterly ridiculous.",4
4601,I enjoyed the matrix all 3 movies and it ground breaking effects. I dont remember it being so full of dialogue as this one to be honest. There is no real feeling or spark in this movie and i think its got to do with so many movies these days having so many special effects it made one numb to this.I find it watchable and great action but really the spark is not there. Maybe i am older now and been through so many action scifi movies that this seem just one one the many with no special meaning.I say watch it and judge for yourself .Live life love.,6
4602,Keanu Reaves is a legend. And u are either too old to understand this movie or the struggles of corporate life is too unfomiliar for u. This was no a good balance with great actors.,10
4603,"This ""resurrection"" is a failure and to me it killed more than it resurrected.The trilogy is great to say the least.Part 4 could've been great sadly it isn't.",3
4604,"As a Matrix fan was reading review and critics since few days, didn't want to say or write anything before seeing it myself. Waited for 20 years and I want to be fair with my take:1- For the fans, there is a power shift in the concept overall and I believe it is mainly because of Lana's realization and what she went through from the first one and what he was and this one and she is now, and who can be a better person than her to show us 2 different prospectives she lived in both and experienced them both, and the answer easily is there is no one except her. It is a brave storyline and power shift decision. You may not see innovative action scenes like the first ones, but you will see something much more in the story which the freedom of some main character from the traditional matrix ( our mentality Matrix)2- For the new audience, the story has much more than what this is showing alone, please watch the other three before judging this one, then you can read my first point above and you will release how this movie never fail to bring something new into our life and movies experiences3- Overall, the move is up to my expectation and more and I see a new path for the coming new ones if there will be, I see a lot of dimensions opening coming ahead.",10
4605,"I loved the original movies... yes, all 3 of them... not going to say much, but this is a great example of why certain things should be left alone, an example of putting money over story, over fandom, over art, over creativity... I'm going to try to forget this movie.",1
4606,"They had a great opportunity to make something great and they missed. With a big cast and what I can assume is a healthy budget they came up short. The story doesn't track from the start. In the end you are left disappointed and question if maybe this movie just wasn't made for the same audience as the original. If you want action with a great story by all means look elsewhere, the Wachowski's have lost their spark to tell a story.",3
4607,"The Matrix was something that for me were never a choice to make. Everything we know about reality is fake, and we do not have a choice even though the reality to having a conscious is never been more important until now. So for me being in this world is not a choice we were not meant to be born or alive.So when I say that this movie has something that generations from today will struggle while being trapped in this electronic world. We all are slaves to this so called machines, phones, computers and we are lost like everyone trying to escape that rabbit hole. Don't judge something that is not meant to be understood... The Matrix is not a choice and it will never evolve it will never get better or different is just how you are meant to see it, take or don't take the red pill it doesn't matter. You are born as slave and that will never change !!!",10
4608,"Well, the trailer was very exciting I won't lie. The idea that keanu reeves is in ""the real world"" was great. The trippy moments where he sees things within objects amazing.The meeting with trinity was brilliant as well.Bit the new morpheus started out as a ""jokey"" character so how do you expect anyone to take him serious from then......The idea that trinity has the same power just goes against the whole matrix franchise. The concept that they'd spent so long looking for ""the one"", one being a single person. So I thought that idea was rubbish.The novie does well showing us zion which is amazing as well.I just can't get over the trinity angle!",2
4609,"I think this is one of the most daring movies to be released in recent history and anyone that claims that this movie didn't need to be made is missing the point. It is NOT a safe sterilized sequel that is there to entertain and not offend anyone. The movie itself implies that it would have been made with or without Lana Wachowski so she decided to step in and create her own artistic vision instead of the movie turning into another empty, forgettable Hollywood movie that makes a bunch of money only to be forgotten 3 months later.The whole movie is dripping with metaphors as well as social and political commentary. What is the most important element of a Matrix movie? Is it the cool special effects? Is it the action? Is it blowing your mind? Characters in the movie directly ask these questions and I believe in a subtle way the director answers. It is about freeing your mind.The movie trashes the media, government control, and implies that Hollywood is perhaps, artistically bankrupt (really listen to the ""crazy"" Merovingian rant). This is all very powerful, politically charged stuff that you're not supposed to touch in a blockbuster movie if you want to reach the widest audience possible. But Lana (Neo) takes that leap of faith with the audience (Trinity) anyways hoping that the audience will ""get it"" and ""elevate her"" to success. When the film maker (Neo) and the audience (Trinity) connect something powerful happens. Unfortunately, judging by the early reviews this movie is going to crash to the ground as most of the audience prefer the blue pill and are not ready to be unplugged from the Matrix.Is the movie perfect? No. It's a little heavy handed with it's message, there is a bit too much blatant fan service to the first movie, and some of the internet lingo sprinkled in comes off incredibly awkward. Almost like a 40 year old trying to sound cool in front of a bunch of teenagers. However, the movie has a lot to say and will leave you with a lot to think about which is very rare in movies these days. Especially high budget movies.",9
4610,"A complete waste of time, bad characters, worst story line. In short, the perfect example of how to ruin the Matrix franchise. Do us a favor and don't bother making another one.",1
4611,"Sure this movie did not have the same impact when my 23 year old self watched The Matrix in 1999 (on VHS as, like many, I missed this in the cinema!). I was 23!! Life was very different then including me, I was built with the bias of the time! Roll forward 20/ish years, knowing what you know now, seeing what you have seen up to now, and believing what you believe up to now. Things have changed, including you! Do not go into this film expecting the same dramatic, unique and emotional movie as you saw in 1999, but do go into it. No expectations, no bias and no p'reviews. This one caught me by the balls, kept hold of them for 2 hours and left me with a reason to see it again and yearn for the next one. It's a great movie.",8
4612,What a disappointment! Feels like a cheap tv show targeted for teens based on a great movie made for grownups.This project needed someone hungry to make something great. Instead they went with someone who obviously doesn't care at this point or is too tired and just relies on throwbacks and nostalgia.,5
4613,"What can only be said about this movie, except that it is the worst movie in 2021 or rather the worst movie of all Matrix parts. It starts with bad camera work, continues with terrible cuts and really bad fight scenes. I had already heard that the Martial Arts Director was not hired and that was ultimately the result, Neo couldn't fight at all and made movements that seemed to be older. Morpheus looked very dubious, sometimes childlike. The close-ups were too close and the movements of the camera were too jerky. Analyst Neil Patrick Harris had such a zero sense of power. Yes and the storyline, unfortunately completely messed up. Maybe it is sometimes better not to revive any more movie from the past. Or if you bring it back to life, you should have a lot of money, good actors, and a good script. Please save yourself the new Matrix and rather remember the beautiful first Matrix movie.",1
4614,I wish I could do half stars because I'm more of an 8.5 but it is not a terrible sequel to a franchise that should have been left alone.All the plot points to me build off the original well. Do I like the A. I being called morphius or Agent Smiths re-skin? Not really. Is the ending different than expected? Yes but is that a bad thing?But was the original Matrix trilogy really a closed story? I don't think so it was very open ended with the plot that could be further expanded on.I think Resurrections is a solid pick up point from where the originals ended and I'm looking forward to the next movie. Hopefully the next one will be the last and not spread out to a trilogy because there isn't much left to be close upon.,9
4615,The Matrix Resurrections feels like a overpaid Youtube fanfiction movie. Something died inside of me tonight. Its probably the 12year old me who saw The Matrix for the first time in 2000.,4
4616,"The movie is choking under too much random ideas, which don't stand together to make up a solid world and trigger the suspension of disbelief. But the one idea closing the movie at the end clicks so well that I immediately thought it should've been the first thing to play out in any sequel earlier.",6
4617,"From the Matrix Trilogy Lana Wachowsky and she's Team created an inspiring love story to us - as Keanu and Carry-Anne remarked on the tv interviews too!There are so many questions are in the movie. How the sexes, the peoples, working together nowdays?So, if You are waiting the sight, the the extreme actions - there were a lot of slow motion... - this is good, but not the best choise for You. Rather go and see/rent the Trilogy once more again! And/or buy the The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience game online...If You would like to see a colorized with in the real time questions movie with a lot of love and heart, that this is the Best Choise for You to the Christmas Hollydays - or later!...My suggestion yet: handkerchief... More... :)",7
4618,"For me when Gloria Foster died, the Matrix died with her..she was, is, &amp; will ALWAYS be the singular embodiment of all oracles. Where ever you are Gloria, I still feel you inside.Anyway, there were like 2 or 3 really good moments but the rest felt like the echoing after taste from 20+ years ago.Gave it a 7 but it deserves a 6. Time to move on in our lives. Oh well still life changing reminder that even in our fragility our species possesses great power.Talk about Hollywood loyalty. It was really strange to see THAT many people from the Sense 8 show be in the Matrix. Felt Like a strange Mashup/ advertising blitz to revive the sense8 show on Netflix.Don't need a new trilogy BUT... I wouldn't mind a sequel to the animation cuz dat sh$% was dope as heeellll. Love yall.",7
4619,"Just put this franchise to bed, PLEASE! Can we get something thats not a prequel, a sequel or a re-quel? Is creativity dead? I know I'm not alone in this as this current cash-grab matrix mashup is not even on track to recoup the cost to make it!",
4620,"As a matrix fan I was really afraid to see this movie because we all know sad sequel examples, but I should say this movie is almost perfect! Storyline , new characters the way she continued it from revolutions , everything feels in right place, bravo !",9
4621,"Definitely not a one star or two.Thought it was quite good just didn't have the same hold on you, think they was trying to be to clever with the story line ( twists and turns)For me not enough Special Effects and cool moves.We seem to be going down the to much dialogue to explain movies and make them more technical than just entertain us and wow us.Personally I wanted to really watch you could say I'm a matrix stick of rock, snap me in half and your see the code 🤓 but I would rather go see The Kings Man on Boxing Day 😢",6
4622,"Many people feel imprisoned in our society, and we are made to believe we are the ones who can't fit unless we have therapy and make progress. That's how Neo is presented in the beginning of the movie. Later on, his therapist reveals himself as the new architect. It might help many Cognitive Behavioural psychologists rethink their roles. What is progress in therapy? Just being able to fit in a sick, selfish, destructive society is enough? Should we change our thoughts, feelings and attitudes to cope with the reality? Why should we make progress in becoming happier inside the cage, when we can free yourselves? Many don't like this sequel, because this latter idea was already presented in the first movie.However, society has changed since then. For example, Americans are starting to rethink work conditions and understand capitalism is a terrible exploitation against most of us. So it is OK if you don't fit. Tom didn't fit because Neo was his truly self.Moreover, values as love and freedom are always worth revisiting. Bugs and her whole crew risk their lives to free more minds. In particular, they risked everything to free Trinity, because they value Neo's love for her. So much love helps Trinity to find her inner power to fly (considered the biggest mind opening gift one can achieve). This movie is a love story. But not a cheap one. It paints beautifully Lao Tzu saying: ""Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage"".",10
4623,"Even though Wachowski doesn't break new ground, her direction feels so much more accomplished. Jessica Henwick somehow manages to steal this from Keanu, Carrie Ann and Yahya. It looks and feels polished, mostly. Probably 15 minutes too long. Love the Sense8 casting crossover + Chad Stahelski cameo.Nothing here hits quite like the major fights in any of the original 3, but I think this is the best of the sequels. Liked it. Would maybe love it if there's a part 2 to complement.",6
4624,This movie the only thing that i liked is keanu reeves is back but the story of making him alive again wasn't enough to convince me the action were good but the action and fight scenes the matrix 1 and 2 were masterpiece and also 1 and 2 better than part 3 and i see that part 4 is slightly better than part 3.,6
4625,"So I've seen a lot of others talk about this in a negative light. I had to see it twice, and I feel the need to write a review on this.Now in all honesty, if people were expecting this movie to be like the original, they were in for a rude awakening. If you know the back story, the fact that the Warner Bros wanted to make this movie with or without the Wanchowskis, and can understand the message Lana conveys throughout the film about modern conventions, corporate greed, and playing on nostalgia, you might appreciate this movie to an extent.Having said this, I do wish this movie wasn't made, and the franchise I love wasn't resurrected. It is a dangerous thing playing with the past, especially an iconic franchise like The Matrix and the effect it had. I feel it was concluded after Revolutions, it left the door open to discussion, and fan theory which I liked. But as far as I can see Lana had no choice in the matter, and she made this movie to criticise those who forced her to do so.",6
4626,"It seems that the creators of the Matrix didn't want to make this movie, but were forced into it. That isn't the best way to start out a production. The good news is that the initial premise and the beginning start out very good. It also doesn't beat you over the head with blatant political posturing that is a seeming fad in movies and TV.It was good to see Keanu back playing Mr. Anderson / Neo he spends most of his time as Mr. Anderson. I found the reboot / switch they made in order to continue the story decently done. It was interesting at first, but an hour and a half in I was wondering what the plot was.When things finally transition over to being Neo again and the action part of the film is where things fall apart. The action is bad. Keanu does little to no actual fighting. He has turned into more of a caster where he throws up his magic shield against everything and grunts.The good in the later section is mostly from Trinity and Neo's relationship which is well done. However the ending is not fulfilling and is poorly done.The disappointing thing about this movie is they setup some very interesting premises, but never followed through on any of them. Hopefully if they make another movie they will focus on the amazing world that the Matrix is. As good as it was seeing Trinity and Neo again that can't carry an entire movie. Especially when it is the 4th movie in the series and they don't do anything interesting plot wise.In the end the movie wasn't terrible, or awesome. It came off as uneven and mostly meh.",6
4627,"The Matrix Resurrections managed to bring some new, interesting concepts to the series that could have potentially been expanded upon to further build the world. Unfortunately, these ideas are overwhelmed by over-excessive and needless flashbacks, as well as a bad case of ""deja vu"".The film seems to constantly jest at itself that the majority of it is almost an exact replica of the plot for the first movie, and it has such an over-abundance of fan service that it leaves little room for the new ideas to breath. The Matrix using Neo's power to implement changes to its system, and the mechanical civil war taking place on the outside world, are both made out to be important elements to the plot that never really fully pan out by the end of the film.On a positive note, the visuals and art design for some of the settings looked terrific and the acting for most of the main cast made the simplistic plot entertaining to get through. Neil Patrick Harris' therapy sessions with Neo really delved in to the mentality of being re-imbedded in the Matrix, and brought back the question of ""what is truly real?"".In the end, this movie does exactly what it sets out to do and nothing more by ""resurrecting"" the main characters. Aside from that, and the very few new ideas brought in to the Matrix Universe, this sequel does little for the rest of the series.",6
4628,"It should be called The Matrix Re-Do. Not much original content. Heck, they even used some of the exact same dialog. I'm glad I didn't pay extra. If you didn't watch the original series, the ideas here might interest you. If you did watch the original, this is a waste of time.",
4629,"Total snooze fest, made no sense, fell asleep in first half hour .....don't waste your time, a total disappointment and confusing story line with a very abrupt ending.",1
4630,"Let me start off by saying that I watched this movie already having low expectations for it.I'm trying my best to keep this spoiler-free, so I can say this: What was missing from this reboot was soul.Here are a few other things:NEW CHARACTERSThey didn't work. It's hard to feel any connection to them at all. They just don't leap off the page or illicit any strong affinity with themOLD CHARACTERSIt's great to see Reeves and Moss back together again, but I really wish we could have also had Fishburne and Weaving. Pinkett-Smith is also there in a poorly-written role, for my money.ANTAGONISTSI was ambivalent to them. Smith came across as more of a frat boy than a threat.SET PIECESMost disappointing of all, perhaps, are these scenes. It really needed something to set it apart. We had 'bullet time' in the first, the highway chase in the second and the final fight in the third. Here, I find it difficult to remember a really stand-out scene on which the movie hinged. Honestly, I can't think of one.It is more storyboard that script. The philosophical part of the story doesn't score well. It feels too rehashed. The fight scenes feel like they were (poorly) imagined first and the film built around them. There is one scene where a character from an earlier movie makes a return and you will ask yourself ""why?"".My honest feeling is that this would have worked well as a graphic novel. We may have even had our beloved Agent Smith central to the story. Perhaps based off of two or three of those, we would have the movie that this franchise deserves.",6
4631,"The film simply brings back the greatness of M1 as a key element.Although it got nice vfx, sound and color, the story was bad.The script is sketchy, while its logic and structure in some places I would say it's jestingly and it fails to convince you and make you question whether the world we live in is really a Matrix. While it is predictable from the beginning. It introduces some new elements but it is not enough to distinguish it while it does not make good use of that. It is just a shadow of itself.",6
4632,"""Red pilling"" means ""waking up"" to facts regardless of politics. If you want to reclaim the phrase-- in this case making ""red pill"" ONLY a leftist thing-- you wouldn't make all of the bad people represent oppression and dormancy with the color blue. They waited 18 years to make a sequel but didn't spend 18 seconds thinking this through.",1
4633,What was the crew thinking while making this movie? Didn't anyone warn them? Worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Biggest disappointment in movie history. I wish i could give 0 points.,1
4634,"Amazing sequel, generation z is big mad cause they were called out on their BS. People grew tired of the Sci fi movies with infinite genders and woke agenda. Good fun movie with no leftist.",10
4635,"I've always been a huge fan to the Matrix. We all know, it is a tremendous challenge to develop on such a legacy. That's why the outcome is always either amazing or disastrous. Well, let's be honest, there was nothing amazing about the ""Resurrections"". Seemed more like ""Exhumations""..",4
4636,"It's basically a documentary about the Matrix movies, within a movie. ""Wow what a mindbend!"" you might think, but in reality it's just stupid. They wanted a budget to waste on pretty CG and a couple of fairly crappy action scenes. Waste of money.You keep waiting for something new and interesting to happen, but no, it's just this weird, weird rehash without a point. I found myself fed up with the ""lEtS rEmIX eVerYtHinG"" at the half-way point and just zoned out.I regret wasting my time on this.",2
4637,"For some reason all the hate ironically seems generated by bots. This goes for Reddit aswell.I must say I was pleasently surprised, it worked on many levels. Could have done without the fast editing and the lackluster chase through the city in the finale.",9
4638,"Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers : I actually enjoyed the film simply for the half decent plot I saw them trying to do. However the issue was wachowski thought that its been 20 years we have to retread everything. I like the schizo neo concept but that wasn't explored well and either commit fully or a concept falls on its ass. The ending closed off an chances at a sequel but at the same time made the franchise go out with a fart rather than a bang. There was a lot I liked about this one but unless you're a huge fan you'd probably be like: why did it take an hour for Neo to do anything? The writers and director poking fun at the sequel was okay but the joke dragged with the 15 min meeting room session. There was a lot that worked but a lot that did not. Neo never got to use his full power and that was a let down. They explored Neo's power coming from his love for Trinity but there wasn't any full on ""boom"" moment like in matrix 3. There was small bursts which made me think I was watching smallville and not a blockbuster film. Agent smith saving the day and then leaving was a weird decision too. They explored Neo and Smith being Ying and Yang then did nothing with it. I almost expected them to reveal in the beginning that they tricked Neo into coding the current Matrix. That never happened. I expected them to make the blue haired girl the real trinity. They sort of did that but in a clunky way. Trinity flying at the climax was okay but then Neo flies at the end so there was a big wtf. This entire film felt like it should have been another 3 movies. However they shoved it all into one with a lot of bs decisions and it made.... this. The series is gone and the curse of matrix sequels will never subside. P. S. Neil Patrick Harris wasn't great.",5
4639,"I did not expect much from this movie because I did not enjoy 2 or 3. I had also not heard anything about it since the release and that put me on notice. Like some musical artists and authors, some filmmakers are one-hit wonders. This is the case with Wachowski. Might be able to make a cool-looking movie, but flunked the storytelling and cohesion courses. Like others, I was thoroughly bored with this movie. I kept looking at the clock and figuring when this nightmare would end.Keanu Reeves needs to lose the 'homeless guy beard' thing once and for all because it just doesn't work with him. His line delivery was so stilted and just...bad, that I found myself choking back laughter. None of the bad guys were interesting or menacing. The storyline made absolutely no sense and failed to bridge the glaring narrative gaps. This movie was so bad. I am so glad I rented it for free because if I had paid for this turkey, I would have never forgiven myself.",2
4640,"After 3 attempts to watch the film (it's too long) I finallyase it to the end and...Yeah there are a lot of good ideas that just aren't handled very well like the whole ""meta"" thing which is shoved down your throat at most opportunities. Also the recapping of the most of trilogy starts off nostalgic and then quickly becomes annoyingSome of the dialogue is terrible even for The Matrix and its fighting DNA is largely missing and when it does appear it feels a bit weird and messy.Shorter length, less ""meta"" and more fighting and Trinity would've helped.",5
4641,"Action packed flick, long storyline.Good first half with the mind boggling bits, could have made more of that rather than follow the rabit down the overly used love interwinding romance. Not sure if it spells out the directors life as much as it does for the Matrix.Remove Morpheus and Trinity already...What value add did they bring?As much value add as this rant.= Nothing.",6
4642,"Can't remember the last time when i was so dissapointed by i movie. Seriously, i can't. After strugling to watch this... ""documentary"" about Matrix, i falled asleep. Seriously. There is a teribile amount of TALKING and TALKING and TALKING and again TALKING. Bla, bla, bla, bla and again bla, bla, bla.Basicaly, this is the worst ""remake"" after the ""original"" Matrix, with bad acting, bad script and dull actors.",5
4643,"Yes , the concept is old and is hard to reinvent the wheel.So why not present the wheel as it is ?Much has been said about The Matrix 4 , but the overlooked idea was that a sequel is loosing its pace when the story gets repeated.The final question is : do we want Matrix 5 ?I do , that's why i gave it 9 out of 10 .",9
4644,"In the end there were some new layers and elements added to the story of the trilogy. Sometimes with funny twists. It was colourful. Those were the only things that made it worth watching. But you'll have to sit through the first disenchanting part, and you won't find any notable new special effects.",7
4645,Remember Sophia Urista from the band Brass Against relieved herself in a man's mouth at a live show not too long ago?For The Matrix Resurrections. She covers the same Rage Against the Machine song that played at the end of the original Matrix during the end credits. Replacing the original singer Zack de la Rocha. Copying instead of creating something original.Very appropriate.I feel like Lana Wachowski relieved herself in the mouths of the fans of the original Trilogy with this very forgettable piece of crap. Now we know who has the talent in that family.This movie feels like a bad copy of the original. Done for wrong reasons and out of anger. The constant flashbacks only reinforce what we're missing!,3
4646,"You are excited to see Neo again and when u realize he'a living in the matrix, it's kind of cool to wait to see him freed, but unfortunately as it develops, the story is slow and becomes boring, with no deeper layer.I want to see the great Neo destroy worlds and kick ass, but during 3 quarters of the movie, he is only getting his ass kicked; Morpheus is not credible and his performance doesn't prove that he can bring the real Neo back. The end fight is again, Neo running to save his life with Trinity, not an empowered character. The human robots jumping from windows as bombs....soo lame..Still, I would reco seeing this comeback, to update ourselves on the fate of Zion, agent Smith, etc, etc :)",6
4647,I'm really disappointed at this movie. I would have done a better job directing and I'm not anywhere near having directing skills.It's sick how movies these days have a certain script they all have to stick to. It makes the movies lose originality and uniqueness.Neo in this movie is pathetic and boring as hell.Thanks for ruining my childhood.,4
4648,"If one manages, for a moment, to put aside all we know about The Matrix and its sequels, Resurrections approaches those events in a 'could be' refreshing way. The first part of the movie has the potential to be seen, almost, as a parody of the previous three movies. They could have gone a million different places with this. Neo might never have been Neo. The Modal might just have been a remnant of his deranged mind. Up to the moment Thomas Anderson swallows that red pill this movie had a real chance of bringing closure to the franchise by questioning the reality of everything that actually/supposedly happened in the trilogy. A callback to the biggest question looming over The Matrix, ""what is real and what's not"". Of course there are all these little clues that seem to confirm the Matrix is real, but even those could have be written off as coincidences and dead-ends in a very elaborate labyrinth. Then Mr. Anderson takes that red pill and all goes downhill quickly. Nothing makes sense, it has all the makings of a low grade, fan made, crowdfunded blunder of a sequel. There is no believable storyline. 60 years passed and what, that's it? Most characters are invisible or have no depth. Even the reason given to keep Neo and Trinity alive only computes as a desperate attempt to revive an amazingly successfully franchise and squeeze in another trilogy. It's a 5/10 for what it could have been, though the movie itself probably doesn't justify such a generous grade.",5
4649,"Finished new Matrix movie. (I know that everyone already bored of opinions, but here is mine 😁)Those who don't want to get spoilers here, I will just say that you will like it and understand it or you going to hate it :)I rate it 7/10 and there is why:SPOILERS ALERTFirst 30 minutes.... I thought I going to end watching it, because of cringe. I mean first 30 minutes with Bugs and ""new"" Morpheus was to weird for me, but now I see that it show us an important part of the story.I very liked how they interact with old movies (adding old scenes as memories). The idea of the new matrix (new gen matrix, how I remember its 7gen, correct me if I wrong) is awesome. I mean now they using emotional power of two powerful people (Neo and Trinity). And that's a good idea. I love how they made ""real"" world. New lore is greate.I loved every scene with Neo and Trinity, but oh... Battle scenes...Battle scenes feels cheap. I just remember that battle scene on the roof was more or less good and scene when Neo fighting with Smith was greate. Every other scene feels like Marvel fighting scene (not realistic, even in Matrix world).The ending....I think one of the worst part in the movie is the ending. The ending where Trinity and Neo shakes hands was good. But why, why they addet that scene at Analyst (he is not new architector, thats important) house. I mean they just ruined atmosphere. I was happy with ending when both characters meets each other at the ""real"" world.Soundtrack:I don't know what to say. Matrix is not about cool background music. The sounds was okay. Nothing wrong with that.Graphics:graphics isn't something wow. It looks good, but nothing more.Story:as I said, beginning and ending was... Bad, but main story was carried by two main characters.Characters:oh well. Main (Neo and Trinity) was awesome. I LOVE them both. What about old ones? They were okay. I wanted something more about Smith and other old characters lore. More information what happened for all those 60 years.New one's are.... I just have nothing to say about them. New Morpheus is annoying. In my opinion he ruining an atmosphere in the movie. Bugs and her crew was just okay. I don't even remember names of those characters 😀Overall:For me, Neo and Trinity cared the movie. If not them, I would set 5/10, no more. But damn, their relationship and their story is that what I love. I miss old Morpheus...Will I wait for the new part? Answer- Yes. I just want to see what's next. I hope next movie going to have more of Matrix atmosphere.",7
4650,"Ouch. I wanted to like this film. Keanu and Carrie-Ann on screen together again? Sweet!But this is just... literally a weak imitation of the first film. Don't get me wrong, it has some good moments. The new cast members are passable. In particular, Morphe-ish does a good job.However, Agent SMH is just that, a pathetic homage to the real titan. Neal Patrick Harris does a good job as The Analyst, but it's not a character that should be in the film. Oh yeah, let's shoehorn hobo Merovingian in there, sputtering incoherently. For reasons? Nah, no reasons.Soundtrack? What soundtrack. Juno Reactor? Nowhere to be found. Don Davis? Nada. Killer metal and rock? Nope. Pounding basslines to really set off fantastic set pieces? No. Massive Attack to set the tone? No. Something bonkers off the wall to match a bonkers oh-there-goes-the-wall Lobby Scene? No.By about 40mins in, I expected someone to flat out wink at the camera. By the end, I was amazed Keanu's arms weren't tired from doing jazz hands and nothing else.And let's not forget the awkwardly cut fight scenes. Gone are the meticulously choreographed long takes of actual Kung Fu and variations. Nah, it's abundantly clear many of the actors had little, if any, skill at stage fighting or real fighting styles... and the camera has to cover it up.I think my favorite part of the entire thing was the cat, to be honest. I'll have to rewatch the original to remind myself The Matrix was in fact good at one point. This movie does a better job of being a sequel to the romance of Neo and Trinity than it does any attempt at adding to the Matrix universe.",4
4651,"You have no idea how excited I was when I heard about The Matrix Resurrections. Unfortunately, it was definitely not what I expected.In the first 30 minutes, I didn't understand almost anything at all. And the first films were made in the early 2000s and they came out brilliant, imagine what they could do now with all the technology.I just feel like the writers were stuck in the Revolutions' ending and they wanted to make a more modern version of the series. There are some cool visual effects and some action but not in that Matrix-style.But I love the film because they at least got Keanu and Carrie-Anne back as the main characters. Also, I like that Lana Wachowski finally figures out that it's about Neo and Trinity. But for me, the series ended with The Matrix Revolutions.",6
4652,99 / 100 almost perfect from start to finish.Genuinely flawless performances and great pacing and storyline.Restored a franchise to its 1999 glory.,10
4653,"Not sure what I was watching. A game? A game? Oh a dream? The biggest cop out. Come on!! Someone else should have taken this franchise. Get someone new with new ideas. What a waste of getting Keanu and Moss. Morpheus was useless. The Smith actor was a catalog mile with no substance. The French guy was homeless? The storyline was dumb. If you saw Wes Craven's New Nightmare you'll get what reference. A movie inside a movie. Or a game inside a game. It was all a dream. Any sequel the tries to destroy the original by making it (forcefully) into something else is a no. You just don't do that. Not Matrix. I stoped the movie after 3/4 through. I hope they get someone else like Lucas did. This is Warner Bros. Star Wars. This is Warner Bros not being able to deliver again and Disney continuing to outshine and out money and out talent. Writing. Writing. Writing. It's all about that. And then you write some more. If you don't make it bigger than the original don't even try. Not The Matrix. Remember? ""What is the Matrix?"" .com It's not IO or Zion. That whole world is useless. It's about THE MATRIX. What you can do there is spectacular. It's about a revolution. About unplugging. About showing the truth. In this world we need the truth. I think the Director/s works for the machine. The money machine. There is no Spoon. Not in this one anyways.",5
4654,Who is this movie made for? Who asked for this??Only reason I can think of for this disgusting movie to be made is to capitalize on curious creatures like me. And I fell for it.. I'm too naive for my own good.I gave it 1/10 because that's just what it is. This might just be the worst movie I have ever seen and that's saying quite a lot.,1
4655,I bloody loved it !!! Grew up with the films and games and still bent my mind. The haters are all bots created to keep us from escaping the Matrix!!! If your in your 30s and a man watch it.,8
4656,"See people complaining about it was just a video game or why old cast people are not there. From what i understood, the matrix was making Neo think it was just a video game he created and the rest, its 60 years in the future. Morpheus etc would most likely be dead from old age. Far as the smith recast not sure, but it was explained the matrix can change peoples digital self images. It's not great like the first movie but was ok. Didn't care for the last 20 minutes like why Trinity had powers that were far more than Neo ever had and knew how do use them right off.",6
4657,"I turned it off half way through. Poor camera work, movie is all over the place. Found it very hard to follow. Fight scenes had the camera work too close and would not keep still, did my head in. First movie ever where I felt like I wanted a refund. Waste of money buying it.",3
4658,"It is better in set design and effects than 2n3 witch looked like turds compared to the first. The storyline/plot was ok but the comic relief was social, entertainment industry, and political quips that felt desperate, coerced, unnatural and scripted so it untastefully dates the film and compromises the characters. When u paint the Mona Lisa don't go making sequels. Unfortunately its hard for the artist to see the masterpiece come into its being with life tempting us with all its external influence and extravagance. So more times then not they say F it ill take the money. No shame in that?",6
4659,"Usually i only read reviews but i felt like this Movie, if taken seriously, destroys whatever deeper meaning and filmographic artistry the first movie created. This movies is such garbarge that i felt like i have to create an account only to rate it. Film studios should never be allowed to release sth that bad. Im certain that people were working hard to create this, but things didnt come out right and now Warner Brothers released this, only so they dont sit on a major loss - thats my guess. Anyhow, I would consider The Matrix being one of my favorite Movies of all time. I grew up with this Movie. It was inspirational. This here - i'd advice everyone to skip it. I refuse to relate it to the first Film(s).",1
4660,"Good to see Keanu and Carrie-Anne Moss toguether again on screen.Back in 1999 my father took me to the mall and we crossed by a film poster that was dark with a few green lettering with no info. We decided to watch and I left the movie theater saying this movie I think it changed my brain. Well I was 12 yo.First things first, the jokes about Warner trying to reboot the movie, with or without the original actors, didn't worked for me. You could have done a better job instead.I really tried to enjoy this movie i really did. It has fan service but thats it.In parts, the visual effects were great! Much better than last Terminator movie even couinting with James Cameron on board as a producer.The script was lame, bad written, lazy and disrrespectful with the audiance.Back on track, Matrix were and still a critic to technology and all the bad things that comes with it. Matrix Ressuractions in my point of view is a dense critic to tech. The analyst interpreted by Neil Patrick Harris or How I met Your Mother guy, pointed that the people living on his new version of Matrix want to stay there, they are living their lives normally even knowing that it is the Matrix. Well we're living times that a blue pill would be great isnt it?!Living a milionare life without having anything is not META, it's Instagram or any social media. You just don't know what is real anymore and get accomodated with this doppamine addiction.In the end Keanu and Trinity said that they will remember people what real should look like.Well that is what the original movie were and still, a reminder of what they wanted to show us more than 20 years ago and reality is now worse.",6
4661,Love this movie! This is the best movie I have seen so far this year. Lana Wachowski did a phenomenal job creating this sequel. I can watch it for free on HBO Max so I am going to keep watching it again and again until I pass out.,10
4662,"I didn't have high expectations on this film. Everybody agrees they should have left the trilogy as it was. But this was such a waste.I watched it with a couple of friends. One left and went to bed after half an hour. To be fair, she was already tired.Half way through, my other friend says ""If it wasn't Matrix, I would have switched it off by now"". I agree. The film it terribly boring. It almost looks like they were forced to make the sequel and they are making a parody of it. I'm impatiently waiting for the turn that doesn't arrive.Then, it finally gets somewhat better. But it's unconvincing and flawed.The only positive was seeing again the characters from the original series.",3
4663,"I enjoyed the original trilogy, but was not a mega-fan. That said, this is an okay movie, not a great one.There is meta commentary, and tongue in cheek moments, which can be subtle and fun at times, but now and again the movie's plot and dialog are more like a sledge-hammer to the face.Similar to Disney using their live action adaptations to stamp out popular points of criticism from prior animated movies, this sequel goes out of it's way to answer or debunk theories fans attributed to the first three films. Which is fine, but the execution was clunkier than I would have liked.At the end of the movie, I was left feeling like I had just gone in a giant circle. I wasn't feeling free, or hopeful, or even like there had been any changes to the status quo we hadn't seen before. So, what was the point? Happy to see a lot of these characters again, but don't think I would rewatch.",5
4664,"Very lazily written and even worse plot. Pointless. Took the past movies, cut and chopped and put together again to make a new movie. The movie was pointless and clearly an attempt a money grab on a previous great franchise. Why they couldn't wait for Hugo Weaving and Lawrence Fishburne to become available (as they have said they were more than willing to return to this Instalment ) but noooooo you had to replace them. I'm guessing in some attempt to at least try and have a plot? (Having to explain why they look different) Save the money and just watch it on streaming services when it's released.",6
4665,"Basically, Neo is being gaslighted into believing he's a game developer with mental health issues. The Matrix is the game he famously developed.Inside the Matrix-Matrix, the Matrix-Game adds a virtual layer.Neo breaks out of the loop inside the Matrix-Matrix by coding Morpheus into the Matrix-Game: somehow real people outside the Matrix-Matrix ""saw"" something happening and could find Neo in the Matrix-Matrix.This whole thing closely parallels the initial events in the original Matrix movie.And there is something quite cool about how the movie begins for the first 45minutes or so. Extremely meta with plenty of throwbacks, which were nice. Also cool how Smith's awakening paralleled Neo's.Merovingian? Interesting way to not forget about exiles, but his only role is to scream in French.What I also found less compelling was the whole story about Trinity and synthients and the new city of Io.Overall, this movie is not at the level of the original Matrix. I'd rate this in between Reloaded and Revolutions. The movie was also not ""necessary""So, why? We have all the answers, it seems:""I'm sure you understand why our beloved parent company Warner Bros. Has decided to make a sequel to the trilogy""""They informed me they're going to do it with or without us""""I know you said the story was over for you ... but that's the thing about stories, they never really end do they?""Matrix resurrections is Matrix meets Mythic Quest meets streaming services.I also got a feeling there's an attempt here to make the Matrix like Star Wars. Like synthients (the little robots that are friendly to humans) being sold as merch at stores. At times, this movie had Return of the Jedi vibes.Very watchable, not very memorable.",7
4666,"I was very hyped, but watched the whole trilogy again before watching the 4th now. Lowered my expectations just in case. There are some new aspects (like being more satiric) and cutting off ""unnecessary"" scenes. You gotta watch this movie with an open mind. They did what I thought wasn't possible in bring in new aspects and refreshing the story, it's in line with new technology and new generations.What I did love most is that they kept true to the story nevertheless. This is difficult, but Lana managed to do it. It's not a ground-breaking movie, but for true fans it's a great sequel, actually. Come up with a better idea yourself and send it to Lana if you think you have a better one.Great actors as usual. Great effects. Good cinematography. Good story. Intriguing music and sound effects. It's a grown up version of Matrix.Was there a need for Resurrections? Kinda. If they are gonna show us one day how perfect the new world is then yes. Did they do it now? No. Was it great watching Lana and the cast in action again? YES, and you can see how evolved Matrix has become. Will non-fans like this? Kinda. It's enjoyable, but if you are a true follower of all the details in the previous trilogy, then you will appreciate the ideas behind this movie, and how they came up with a follow-up story.I don't usually write reviews, but it is needed when the user score is at 5,8. It's not fair at all! I mean, c'mon even bad horror movies get 5,8. This is a clear 7,5 at least. It's definitely worth a break from your Matrix.",8
4667,I don't trust any comments of the new generation raised by Tiktok. Every frame of the film is a masterpiece of art. How can you expect to see a new generation of YouTube acceleration really have the patience to sit down and enjoy the film.,10
4668,"As usual, people seem too hung up on nostalgia to rate a movie in it's own rihht. Is this movie as good as the first matrix movie? No, but that is an incredibly high bar. Matrix 2 wasn't great and 3 was trash. How on earth people aren't relieved this has bucked thee slump is beyond me. This matrix almost shies away from focusing on tech themes. This is far better than2 and 3 and introduces some intresting questions around conscious choice. I personally had pretty low expectations and was very happy with the direction they decided to go on this one. If you liked the first matrix, there is a good chance you will like this movie if you manage to taper your expectations realistically.",8
4669,"English isn't my first language, so I am really sorry if this review will contain mistakes, sorry that it's so gonzo-like, but I'll try to be briefly.And the most briefly way to review this film is: ""take Matrix 3, and divide by ten"". Because it's really much, much worse. More mismatches with original lore, more logical flaws, and because Sci-Fi needs to be logically to not distract viewer - it's a very bad one. It was physically hard to watch this movie to the end, so I was staring at my smartphone, reading the lore of original trilogy, because at one time I thought that I was a problem, and I don't understand the connections with original lore. But it wasn't. And the biggest problem of this movie is that Matrix: Resurrection destroy the open final of the Matrix 3. It was the only great thing in that movie, and Matrix: Resurrection steals even that.But the movie has some pros: for example Neill Patrick Harris acting was awesome. And I hope that Lana Wachovski have really got her serenity, that she was so desperate to find making this film.I think this movie don't worth your time and money. Warner Brothers had some tough times, but they don't even try to make it better. All movies they developed in last, I believe, 5 years have such a poor logical background of screenplay. The Matrix Universe had it's lore with it's internal logic already. But instead of making normal movie, Warner Brothers had produced a poor Matrix funfic.Verdict is 1/10.",1
4670,"The Matrix Resurrections was brilliant. I enjoyed it immensely. There were fight scenes that made you feel nostalgic about the other films, however this film has its own unique flare.Firstly, if you don't get this film it's because you are looking at it on a surface level. This film is deep on many levels. It pokes fun at itself and the absurdness of having to revisit something that wanted to be closed but did it really?. For example in the film Neo is developing a 4th Matrix game about his his experiences (which he suspects may be a dream).I enjoyed this take as I'm watching the 4th Matrix film and the main character Neo is developing a game about his life in the film. It goes down layers.Secondly the part of the Analyst is played well by Neil Patrick Harris. He brings a kind of balance to the film. The scene where time is frozen for Neo as he explains why he kept Neo is check is smart.I also enjoyed the tone of the film. In the first Matrix all scenes in The Matrix were green. This one is filled with bright cyberpunk like colors, symbolizing the colorful world that Sati envisioned when the matrix was rebooted. The rest of the crew were awesome and the chemistry between Carrie Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves was still there. Give this film a chance and it might just blow your mind, again...",9
4671,"A good piece together for more movies to come.I always have a good laugh at all the negative reviews.A sign of the times.Look forward to5, 6, .....",8
4672,"I loved it. Everything inside, the story, the actors, the effects... just awesome !!! And you get out of it, with some hope and faith to the human kind...",10
4673,"Truthfully, I don't not understand why people are review-bombing this movie. I went in with no expectations and was honestly surprised at how much I like the movie.Reading the reviews left by other people, it feels to me as if most people just aren't understand what the premise of this movie is, or what the Matrix trilogy was originally about.This story is actually a great continuation of the originally trilogy &amp; I hope it starts a new one. For those who don't like this movie, all I ask is simply this - can you explain WHY this movie is ""the worst thing ever""? As someone who just rewatched the entire original trilogy last month, I legit don't see a huge drop off between those movies and this one.",7
4674,"It's a sequel but also a reboot. It is a self-celebration but also a self-parody. It has good ideas but also a lot of patheticity. It has style but also demeaning banality. All in all it is also decent but it is useless. More than a movie it could be bonus material of the box set. But also the surprise of snacks. A film that will be forgotten as that ghost no one has ever heard of, of that uninhabited street, of that inaccessible neighborhood, of that world that never existed.",6
4675,"I can say that I had no expectations for this film. I didn't expect the new film to be as good or similar to the first one both when I heard the news that they would make a new Matrix and after I saw the trailer. I was actually curious about the story which I wasn't that disappointed with.BUT the story still feels somewhat hasty and urgent instead of building up the events or build up the new characters for the viewer.There is no weight in the new characters, you do not have time to get to know them or learn their personalities unlike the first 3 films where you could see different characters had somewhat different personalities and that made the films more interesting.But as I said, if you want to watch this movie with the expectation of seeing a rehearsal of the first movies, you will be clearly disappointed. But if you watch this movie with an open mind, you will be entertained.Keanu Reeves delivers like Carrie-Anne Moss and Jessica Henwick, the rest do their best,considering their short and pale role in the film.",8
4676,"I had high hopes for this film, unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. This is an example of fan service done poorly when compared to Ghostbusters Afterlife.",5
4677,"Just finished watching the new Matrix movie. And once again, Hollwood provides another reason why paying to see these new movies is a gigantic waste of time. And money.Incomprehensible story filled with excessive and plot-numbing kung-fu BS. Once again (and again and again), a plot that is thinner than rice paper, but, since it was obviously made for those foreign markets where simple, story-less action is the sole purpose of the endevour, I'm sure they'll like it in those eastern, mind-numbed markets. Just another crouching tiger martial arts movie, and not a good one at that.So save your money; the reviews were correct: it's a movie made by the daughter so that someone else couldn't make it. It's even less than a vanity pic. Too many inside jokes. Too much winking at the camera. Sound and fury signifying nothing.To say that the plot is threadbare would be a very kind compliment, one that film doesn't deserve.If they put as much time and effort into the story as they did into the plastic surgery of the so-called stars, they might have made something worthwhile.Instead, we're left with a kung fu movie that is like a parasite on the long-dead corpse of what were good stories and films.This movie is an abomination. The walking dead matrix.Someone should be merciful and put a stake through its heart. After all, it's already dead. Two stars is twice what it should get. It's Christmas. I'm being kind. Consider the extra star and a half my gift to whatever hack wrote this P. O. S.Please. Put it, and us, out of our misery.",2
4678,"I loved The Matrix Trilogy. I kept watching it so many times, but this time, I was somewhat disappointed. The story was okay, but I hated the fight sequence. It was not as epic as the trilogy for me. Also, the swarm part was like a zombie movie, but with a hero who had powers .Also, Neil Patrick Harris ruined this one for me. I like NPH, on TV but being the Analyst didn't suit him. It was like I was watching Count Olaf being in The Matrix.",7
4679,"Taking this as movie as a nostalgic piece and a nod to the originals, I was not disappointed. I thought the new characters, reboots of Characters and how the story unfolds was while confusing at times, worth the wait and it all comes together well.",8
4680,"The whole ""meta"" beginning of the movie is so obnoxious that it made me want to leave the cinema. It just felt so cheap, it's crazy. It felt like they really just wanted to have the first Matrix constantly in the background as ""Memberberries"" and said ""Welp, if we're going to do this, then let's turn it up to 11 and just deep throat the viewers with all of it"". Destroyed the mood for the entire movie. I would enjoy some references to the originals, but this wasn't done properly at all. How can you poke fun at nostalgia and sequels so much in the movie if you create something like this? Did the people writing the dialogue knew it's so bad, that they were making massive fun of themselves?Actors didn't click for me. I only enjoyed Trinity. Neo was very... modern Keanu. Morpheus and Smith were awful.Action scenes were a massive downgrade from the originals. The trilogy's fights were so clean to understand, but here we have pure chaos - couldn't follow what's going on most of the time. Maybe it's my problem tho, I usually need minimal cuts to be able to follow fast-paced action.The movie didn't feel like The Matrix at all. Bad Matrix film and horrible just-film. If you somehow didn't watch the originals (or at least the first one), then I imagine you'll hate this movie.This is my first review on IMDB, I never had an urge to write a bad or good review until today.",4
4681,"20 years ago i was a small kid, but a true Matrix fan form then to now. I watched the trilogy unlimited time in my life and said this dailog ""Mr. Anderson"" infinite times.Thanku for making The Matrix Resurrections, most appreciated movie 👌👌👍👍🔥🔥🔥⚡⚡⚡⚡",10
4682,"The trailer was amazing and I was really excited for this movie.The movie was so cringe and so bad that I hope no one actually see this in the cinema. It's a fun topic to talk about.. But it is so confusing, lacks coherence and sense. It's the biggest disappointment of of 2021 after COVID restrictions.",3
4683,The Matrix Resurrection offers very little to the franchise with its lack lustre plot and script and constantly shuffling scenes from the first movie down your troth. The first act gave me some hope that we would get another grate Matrix movie but after that first 20 or so minutes it goes down hill trying to bring you in with nostalgic for the first trilogy. Overall I still liked the film mainly for the cast and surprising the character of Bugs but it is pretty much just a cash grab so if your not invest in the Matrix sires take the blue pill and skip this one.,7
4684,"Well, I will stop reading reviews before I watched something myself.Is it as good as part 1? No.Were part 2 and 3 as good as part 1? No.But I do think they are fun and cool movies and expanding the matrix lore in a good way. For me at least.This part is doing something new and re using old things.I liked the actors , they only could find a better one for smith....Just go with the flow, and accept entertainment for what it is : entertainment.",8
4685,"How do you follow up the matrix trilogy? That was the question. I think it is a good follow up, a nice movie that uses all the knowledge of matrix from the other movies and takes it further. What I do not want to see is that because of all the bad reviews we will not see a continuation, a matrix 5. I enjoyed it. Probably if it was a marvel movies the marketing would have been ten times bigger the reviews and critics gentler. I like to see a movie that it is true to itself, pretty bold, taking some risks. I can see that it was a hard movie to make - agent smith did not want to retake it's role and other such things. Instead of making cash machines like marvel it is nice to see some daring originality and a feel good movie. Besides Spider Man I did not see anything interesting in the last marvel movies which all have better rates than matrix: Black Widow, Shang Chi, Eternals and Venom. It feels like Disney is becoming the new Harvey Weinstein. Go see the movie and enjoy it for what it is: A MATRIX MOVIE!!!",9
4686,"This Matrix tells us that Thomas has been the developer for a game series called ""The Matrix."" And this might actually prove true. The first scene in the movie brings us back to the Matrix. It has the green hue, subtle patterns of code on reflective surfaces, etc. For example, in first scene, the puddle has patterns of code. This is just a program that Thomas coded.In the first act, Thomas is in the real world. He's not been trapped in the Matrix for 60 years. No, this has been his reality. Notice there aren't any patterns of code on the reflective surfaces and there isn't any green hue. We later find out that all the things in his game is taken from his daily life. Deja Vu the cat, the blue pills, the woman named Tiffany he's been obsessing over. These aren't just Easter eggs, these are things that Thomas took from his life and put it into his game.Also, when he has a coffee with Tiffany, her reflection is revealed for like 2 seconds and we see a completely different person. We see a blond woman. And later in the theater, we see Thomas Anderson's true appearance: an old man. Now, why is this? It's not the Matrix. It's starting to believe that he is Neo, a character he created. He's also imagining that Tiffany looks like Trinity.We also learn that he's a suicide survivor. He incorporated his rivalry with Smith into his game. These are just subtle hints revealing the real truth about The Matrix Resurrections. The mirror scene is his imagination but he's really in his psychiatrist's house and he's telling Thomas the truth. He is having a severe mental breakdown.The Matrix Resurrections isn't meant to be bad reboot, it's meant to branch out the story into the message it's been trying to send since the first movie: How do we know what's real? The choice is yours.",7
4687,"It is difficult to revisit tried and true franchises and have the new product live up to the originals. See THE GODFATHER PART III and STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE for other examples. Creators who revisit beloved stories decades later often lose the thread of what made the originals great, or are surrounded by star-struck yes men and women who refuse to step up and say ""that idea is really bad, cut it from the movie.""While the idea of revisiting THE MATRIX world is a fun one, it undermines the story of the original trilogy. Not that I put much stock into either the sequel or third film, but at least they brought the story to a completed arc and were serviceable action films if nothing else.This film consists almost entirely of nostalgia call-backs towards the original films. If you were unfamiliar with the original MATRIX films you would have no idea what is going on. This is a huge problem. When the best part of your film is re-hashing events of the original you may want to re-evaluate why the new film would even need to exist. Is it to tell a new and interesting story? Or is it to prop up Q4 earnings for a shareholder report?At the end of the original MATRIX (a perfect film by the way), Neo promises to show the people ""a world without rules and controls, without borders and boundaries, a world where anything is possible."" In reality it seems that Neo is under strict control, forced to return and undermine his story and sacrifices in the original films in service to the almighty dollar. Indeed, the magic of the movies is supposed to lie in the promise of 'a world where anything is possible' but in this day and age studios have shunned possibilities in favor of certainties. We must have nostalgia, we must be familiar with the idea before we can market it, we must have IP. We must have a return on investment for our shareholders. Forgetting that once upon a time, THE MATRIX was itself a completely new and revolutionary idea. Maybe the machines are winning the war after all.",1
4688,The only thing that gave this POS movie any validity (and that I changed my rating to a 4) was because of Keanu's presence. (I think he even knew that the movie was going to bomb - but being the team player that he is...he tried his best to keep it all afloat.)I have 2 issues with this farce of a movie - who's idea was it to completely emasculate Neo/Keanu.... AND....why the HELL is John Wick 4 (Keanu's successful franchise built upon talent and hard work) - now being released in March of 2023??!? I find it so strangely odd that this is announced on the heels of The Matrix 4 premiere day. Who is behind this foolishness?Something is rotten in the State of Denmark.,4
4689,"Otherwise it doesn't make sense to make such a movie. It's pretty boring to be honest but maybe it's just my expectations from a new matrix movie.Too long and no action to justify it.Too bad no bullet time fights and shots.It's a decent storyline but again pretty boring after 3 movies of pure action, most of the time is talking and explaining or making insider jokes.Trinity as the one and neo looking like a homeless person is sad to watch really.But I guess they didn't have much of a choice.",5
4690,"Having seen the low IMDB score I was expecting to be disappointed, especially as the 3rd Matrix was, well, rubbish. However this one is very cleverly done and definately worth watching BUT only if you have watched the other ones first. Enjoy !",8
4691,"I really enjoyed the scene where they were discussing the 4th Matrix game and trying to distill what made the original so popular even claiming one word that everyone thinks about when you mention The Matrix! Bullet Time!Even though it is two words and they point it out, they are not wrong. The Matrix was awesome to different people for different reasons.I see this resurrection as one that tries to nibble on the hand that feeds it (with tongue-in-cheek 4th wall comments) but then does what it wants to and tells its own story. It's about our own choices - do we choose to believe and choose to live. Or do we remain placated in the Matrix where NPH can treat us poorly (not that he would ever do this in real life).Take it or leave it, the Matrix has never been about pandering and trying to please everyone. This one is no different and I liked it!Well worth the watch and even better if you like getting your gray matter messed with a bit.",9
4692,My only complaint about this movie is that they should have get a second unit... that's all. We already knew that this movie is about WB wanting to make the impossible the possible. We could even see a mock dialogue to WB between Mr. Anderson and his boss in the beginning of the film. So apart from all the complains I enjoy this movie as a holiday gift. Cheers!,9
4693,"Whoever rated this movie less than 10/10 does not know anything about movies.Absolutely brilliant! I don't see how it could be improved. It had every element of a great film, and complemented the original trilogy perfectly.",10
4694,Sometimes you enjoy a film. But living in a world where video games are used to predict the future AND Trinity is like totally intense and more provoking than an original reboot is exhilarating!But the serious topics are negated by the fun action scenes which engaged in 80s satire and loves it!A fun but ultimately enjoyable experience.,7
4695,This Movie is fantastic! The best Movie of the Last year! I Went sad to the Cinema because the Bad rewiews and Went Happy home because the Film is great!,10
4696,I think most people hating on this movie are missing the pointdid it need to be made ? Nobut it gave neo and trinity the happy ending they never got in the last threemoviesas they were connected in this version of the matrix they are both now the one or the twoand since there both reconstructed versions of them selvesi don't get why people are having a hard time with thatsure we have been pushed with too many female lead actions starsin recent years and this feels like to peoplewhat the woman has the powerbut no they both have itits not the best matrix film in fact all of the others are betterbut i didn't hate it i thought it was a love story happy ending homagefor neo and trinitywhat i would have liked however is bugs as the one that would have been sick a new trilogy with her as she's a great characteranyway how you can rate this a 1 or a 3 is beyond me.,7
4697,"This seemed like a low budget movie. Fight scenes were boring and amateurish. Bugs was quite cool, Dougherty Howser was ok but a only budget version of the Architect. The Merv cameo was gringe. Special effects and action were way worse than 20 years ago so not sure how to at happens. Yawn fest.",3
4698,"Don't get me wrong I entered the cinema prepared for absolute disaster, but oh boy I was disappointed even more. In compare to The Matrix 4, Resident Evil 5 is frackin masterpiece. Absolute BS story and characters, visual effects that are years behind effects in Matrix 2 and 3. Matrix 4 is another proof that man can make a better movies that woman.",2
4699,"I liked this film. It felt like an apology for the mess they left the characters in at the end of the 3rd film. The Matrix was always a love story, not a tragedy which was why we all felt so gutted at the end of Revolutions.A satisfying way to end the series on a positive note. And they lived happily ever after.",9
4700,"Much of the first hour could have been summed up in 20 minutes. Some excellent action falls flat because of ground-breakingly uncomfortable, awkward interactions.The story is unfocused, and an hour in I was more confused than intrigued. Turned it off when Neo was dying and the the teams response was to plug him into the Matrix and have Morpheus kick his ass.Overall, I think it was a messy stab at social commentary, with heavy handed metaphors and a script that would be more suitable for daytime television.That blue haired lady was Def someone I wanted to know more about, but it wasn't worth slogging through another hour of bad writing to uncover. Boooooooooo.",4
4701,"So the whole story is kind of meaningless. Like a sequel just for the sake of sequel. Enter the theater knowing there could be no way this sequel would be able to wow us like the trilogy due to technology advancement. Still, the script and story is kind of ok.",7
4702,"Laugh-out-loud terrible. Fast-forwarded most of the battle scenes at the end, could have used 100% more Carrie-Anne Moss. This could've worked if it had been more in-matrix development and rediscovery .. Instead, too many barely developed characters, stupid and stilted dialogue, and a magician who was not taking his role seriously. Why does NPH always look like he's about to laugh? The last 2 seconds after the credits were the best part. Make us more Sense8!!",5
4703,"The first third is both confusing and intriguing. The middle third ups the ante with fascinating potential. Then the final third takes a dump on your hopes and theories, wraps that turd up with tinfoil, and tries to sell it to you as modern art.FFS.",6
4704,"Sequels are rarely this interesting. This movie is a commentary on the massive success of the original film, and (one of) the creator's relationship to that success. It's a deeply personal film with a big budget, a rarity. Highly recommended if you're looking for an atypical movie.",10
4705,"While I try not to be critical having been in the industry and knowing how hard it is to bring a story to the big screen I gotta say... WOW what a horrible film. At what point did the investors and producers decide that it was still OK to move forward making it? Keanu is a cool guy but his less than stellar acting was not helped with this poor script, storyline, and inexperienced cast. Can only imagine how embarrassing the entire film team must have felt witnessing the final product. Yuck!",1
4706,"You think of the Matrix is being just this one thing but it's been nice to see another side of the Matrix giving it a more elusive look, A ever evolving State of Affairs.",7
4707,"It was a bad and too long teaser. They even didn't know what they want to do it's like john wick came to matrix. Clothes were disasters, direction too horrible, CGI disgusting, new actors specially morpheus doesn't know anything from his role and just making fun ,too cheap. It was a rape to our good memories just for money.",1
4708,"Big fan of the matrix series, but this movie wasn't good. The ending makes no sense. Plot holes were common through the movie. This movie wasnt a sequel but a stand alone film that was garbage. It barely had any connections to the original trilogy. Cliche cliche cliche and cliche. This movie was only made to steal people's money. I couldn't be paid to watch this movie again.",3
4709,"The first three movies had a serious tone. They grappled with tough philosophical questions and challenging intellectual problems. The stakes were high, and the repercussions severe.Even the Antimatrix, which was created in an entirely different medium, without the main storyline or characters, feels much more at home, and as part of the same fictional universe. A universe that cannot be taken lightly. In opposition, Resurrections pales in comparison, looking more like fandom - goofy, all over the place, and not particularly committed to, or aware of, its tone. As a consequence, it doesn't feel like part of this fictional universe at all.Firstly, the plot seems hardly plausible. The premise of the new matrix, and the mechanics behind its sustenance, is ridiculous.On top of that, we have machine civil wars, fought over power crises, while free people roam about, completely under the radar. We also see frequent occurrences of sentient beings who live detached from the collective. This mocks with the severity of the predicament laid out by the original trilogy, positioning the mighty machine AI as a static background in front of which our new drama is allowed to enact freely.Neo's new life in the matrix feels plausible, but it too is stretched thin. The repetitive meta commentary only dilutes the immersion, trying to hook the viewer with nostalgia. But that's fandom - that's not what the matrix was about.Visually, Resurrections looks great, although the ambient is way off in terms of what the previous movies felt like. Color grading, the sets, the editing, the soundtrack - although decent, bear no semblance to the original.The acting, too, is way off the mark. Neo, who once understood the matrix, and changed it via his understanding, is now desperately holding onto his physical acting performances, as if he is on the set of John Wick. The calmness of a man who hacked the virtual world is now replaced by the clumsiness of yet another run-of-the-mill action hero. The chemistry between the young couple from the past, is now replaced by the awkwardness between two aged people who fail to replicate the spark of the past.Overall, the entire project feels forced. Its place is not within the Matrix universe, and consequently, we don't particularly care about the outcome.I gave it 6 stars judged as a standalone movie. It deserves a much lower rating when viewed as part of the Matirx franchise.",6
4710,"I did not have any expectations for it to be better then the original's but damn they missed the mark. I was at least hoping for the fights and CGI to be better but wow how they disappointed, the movements where weird, definitely not fluid and the pace was slow. They should have just copied the prior movies fight stile and pace instead of this terrible performance. There was almost nothing that wowed me in the movie or made me excited, by the end it was basically a Matrix parody. My expectations where down but I had hope for some good fights unfortunately they had to crush that as well.",1
4711,"You should go into this movie with full knowledge of what it is:It is a movie that comments on The Matrix's history, on how the Matrix has influenced and impacted culture in the past twenty years, and reclaims it's symbology from right-wing Nazis. It does this through the vehicle of continuing the story, but it's main purpose is so obvious, and it's themes are so clear, that it's surprising that anyone considers this a reboot or a continuation.I applaud Lana Wachowski for what she's done; it's impressive how she's taken twenty years of impact and distilled it into a resurrection of her and her sister's original stories.",8
4712,"This movie is very good and not boring my opinion This movie is a revival of the Matrix story once again with a new one, and the three parts are like a game in the fourth💚",8
4713,"Was I expecting it to be as great as the first one? Of course now. I think with reboots of a franchise people expect to much. The original Matrix redefined cinema but as two decades have passed of course it can be harder to come by new concepts to break new grounds.The movie is what I expected, but in a good way. It had the action, it had the amazing effects and the perfect storyline to keep me entertained. Overall it was well satisfactory and I wasn't expecting anything more or anything less.",8
4714,The Trilogy is one of my all times favorite.. The only things good about this Movie are the Throwbacks of the Original. I have waited for more but it was somehow predictable that i won't be that good.,5
4715,Good movie and neo is fantastic.Good movie and neo is fantastic.Good movie and neo is fantasticGood movie and neo is fantastic. Good movie and neo is fantastic. Good movie and neo is fantastic. Good movie and neo is fantastic.,10
4716,"It's just a vain, unnecessary cool looking movie. It adds nothing to the mythology of the series. There are beautifully shot scenes but I don't know why we need that movie after 20 years. To make meta commentary about it?Don't get the ""woke"" arguement. It's just a normal movie.",4
4717,"There was a glitch in the matrix and my last review disappeared. I'll keep this one short.A film that was super meta, in aim to be funny and new age, came across as sloppy, lazy and dull. Followed by a storyline that didn't make sense / doesn't enthrall the viewer, with Neo who you don't care about because you already know what he's capable of and can't be defeated so there is no drama. Have we lost all good script writers on Hollywood?This film is a mess. A total snore fest.Two super cringe moments is a first pump with a small machine (assuming it's their for merchandise purposes because otherwise - what the hell was it doing there?) And the end track - a female version of the original ""wake up"" which I think sums the movie up. Let's be new age and quirky, do exactly the same as before but be meta about it.Sloppy, slow, boring.The one good thing is NPH's speech during a bullet time sequence, and even that felt like the starting point where someone scribbled on the cocktail napkin in a Eureka moment - I have an idea!Well... That idea sucked. One more movie added to the list of films that are slowly killing cinema. Might as well stay at home with the ability to stop watching films 30 minutes in if they're pure turd.Don't put yourself through it.",3
4718,"This movie was much anticipated, but felt rushed and lacking in action. It was great to see how they explain how they were able to bring Neo and Trinity back from the dead but as the main focus of the movie being them getting back together (realizing this and seeing how much of the runtime was left) I realized the movie was not going to be ""great"". We are now left with more questions and probably won't get more movies after this to explain them. Hopefully we do, and hopefully they are better. If you go into the movie knowing it's about them getting back together, again, not bad. Nostalgia was also very high and was happy to see references to the other films.",7
4719,"The definition of ""damp squib"" is: a situation or event which is much less impressive than expected.There was something missing in the film and I can't put my finger on it, it's just lacklustre, yes it opens to the door for more sequels but I fear the franchise could go the way of the Terminator franchise where it's a just hollow, soulless husk which cashes in on nostalgia.It feels like a parody of the original Matrix trilogy. I also have an issue with the casting, 2 characters in particular who are instantly attributed with Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving, those two actors in my view are very important to the Matrix movies, they made and shaped those characters with their brilliant acting abilities and they are irreplaceable.",3
4720,"This latest installment of the franchise is really a bit of a mixed bag. There are very good things, that prove that Lana Wachowski hasn't lost her hand with years, and bad ones, that prove just as well that her sister was right to stay out of it.First, the good.There are truly genius ideas in this new movie. The idea of having the Analyst, the AI equivalent of a true bureaucrat/technocrat, who only cares about efficiency, taking the new Matrix in his hands with only these objectives in mind, really make sense, more than the Architect/Oracle rule we had in previous movies.In the same way, having Neo believe he's a video game creator, and that what he vaguely remembers of the first movies comes from there and a psychotic event he had after it was released, where he mixed fiction and reality, was also a good idea.The one I loved most was the concept of Io, a city where humans and AI live in harmony, each contributing to the progress of both.And I really liked all the Easter Eggs left everywhere to remind us of the previous movies.But that's where it starts to fall down: after a while, you can't help but think ""Yes, I get it, I remember the movies too"". Among those reminders that were clearly not only unnecessary, but actually annoying, is the Merovingian. What does he bring to the movie? He's not even funny, just annoying.I think the real shame is that Lana clearly had very good concepts there, as I listed above, and the visuals, as always with the Wachowskis, are stunning. But she also clearly lacked ideas on how to bring all this into a coherent movie. It's like she took all of that, mixed a few action scenes here and there, Easter Eggs for nostalgia, a bit of in-your-face social messages, shake a few times, and voilà!Except it doesn't work. We're left wondering what exactly went wrong. As I said, there are really good ideas, the acting is impeccable, the cinematography superb, but the mix just doesn't work. Maybe some string of story that would hold everything together, instead of all these pieces not quite fitting together, I don't know.That's why I titled this review: a missed opportunity. Everything was there for a great revival of the franchise (but did it actually need to be revived?), but it still failed in the end. Close, but no cigar.",7
4721,"I am fan of The Matrix, a film released in a year that I consider one of the best, if not the best ever, in film releases, American beauty, the sixth sense, fight club, the green mile, girl interrupted, being John malkovich, Notting Hill, Magnolia... These were all released in 1999 and still The Matrix stood out. When I heard they were doing another Matrix I was excited and intrigued to see what they were going with the story and a bit worried they'd ruin the legacy.I watched it last night and while it was nice to revisit the characters and the matrix universe, this does not feel a Matrix movie, the tone is wrong, the tool palette is wrong(more Speed Racer and Tim Burton's Willy Wonka than Matrix) , the special effects are worse than in the original, the fights look so fake it's ridiculous and the plot is, well, just a mess. The movie feels cheap and I'm sure it wasn't..I really wanted to like this, but unfortunately this is just milking the original and watering it down.Ultimately this doesn't deserve a 1 nor a 10 as I've seen from haters and fans but probably a 5, which is a shame.",5
4722,"The Matrix was wonderful when it first released to cinema. I was big on computers back then with the release of html, y2k and the web at the start of its existence. Neo gave us a seat into his hacker lifestyle and the ride was exciting. It introduced new elements of graphics, 3d design and opened a wormhole with the story that I've never seen before. It was beautiful.As like all good things, they come to an end. When Karate kid rebooted, I wondered to myself, how would this be any good from the original? It couldn't be possible. If you truly enjoy a film, you'll find yourself watching the reboot trying to re-live the past and expect those same feelings to lift you up. I think we're all guilty of this.When I began watching the intro, I immediately felt nostalgia. Then it faded away through the somewhat dramatic introduction of what was already done. Watching the movie from another character's perspective? How original. I will give Bugs credit though and the rest of the crew. They performed exceptionally well considering the writing.As for Keanu, you have to give the guy credit. He's closing in on his 60's and this type of film make sense for the younger generation. If Agent Smith were here, I'm sure he would agree that the passing of the flame is inevitable. I could be wrong though. Look at Clint Eastwood, Sly and Arnold.Overall, they did ok. I think they had a great opportunity to leave the viewers at edge with what the Matrix was supposed to be. For me, it was disappointing to experience a Netflix series type of film in cinema. Though it's no surprise coming from WB. Look at how they did Justice League. Thank God Zack resurrected it even after all he's been through.Maybe I'm just old and miss what movies were once before. I'm sure the younger generation will enjoy it.",7
4723,"I am very happy when everyone is disappointed upon watching some movie, but I am positively surprised. Honestly, there was no need for sequels (I'll give you that) because the trilogy as a whole is perfect for me, although many people do not like the second and third part (I have never understood why, without them the story would have been incomplete). However, Matrix Resurrection was far from disappointment and did not deserve such low ratings...The Matrix is not an action movie, it may have changed the cinematography forever with its effects, but The Matrix is primarily a metaphorical film, you must always watch The Matrix from a different perspective, The Matrix is primarily heard and then seen, The Matrix is the reality that surrounds us and the Wachowski sisters always knew how to present it perfectly or to say they always knew how to ""slap"" us in the face with their view of the world and humanity.I guess a lot of people do not like it, because this part hasn't got that much action, or shooting as the previous one, it makes you listen and think and analyse and SEE the TRUTH. With this part Lana showed us that not only have we not progressed as humanity since the last instalment but we have also sunk deeper and gone worse... The habits, the fears make us passive, make us OBEDIENT, they make it harder to act, to think, the governments, the media and all this technologies turned us into obedient, numb, zombies that forgot to fight for what's right, forgot to think consciously, forgot to love, to live, to be happy without a reason, to stop and just breathe and watch the stars, we lose ourselves in this labyrinth of lies, competition, money grab, fast-paced, disastrous reality (read matrix) and like Thomas Anderson we walk through life stuck in some lifeless universe until someone shows us the White Rabbit 🙂I really liked the subtle details that are everywhere and even more I liked that they focus on that ""cliché"" - Love conquers all, a huge respect for that because the aggression and killing that is present in EVERY other film/series made us completely oblivious of the most important energy without which we can exist as humanity - LOVE. You may say that I am a ""hopeless romantic"" or think that ""it does not exist"" or ""look at the world we live in"" but my answer to that would be - If you think that, then the Matrix has already won.You don't have to take it, but my advice is, please look at it one more time and listen carefully to the conversations.And I think after all of this an appropriate ending to my review is Lana's beautiful tribute to her mother and father at the end of the credits - Love is the genesis of everything!",10
4724,"Ive seen a lot of negative feedback about this movie so far, and I understand a lot of the criticism. This forth movie is not at all the mind-blowing and fantastical tale that the first Matrix was. Personally though, I had a great time watching this, the nostalgia and chemistry between the actors was really good. The new Morpheous didnt really land with me however.If you wanna see what feels like old friends in a very meta-esque film, with action and love then this is for you!I miss the green tint from the original trilogy. But maybe the filmmakers felt it was a bit to gauche or something.",8
4725,"To me this felt more like a TV movie with good CGI and mediocre dialogues. Even though I think they knew what were matrix movies all about, they were just incapable of delivering the same message. Stay away from this one if you are a fan of the matrix trilogy. Otherwise, you will be very disappointed.",5
4726,"Will start this review saying the original trilogy as well as the Animatrix rank at the top of my favorite list. I approached Resurrections with an open mind. I understand the difficulty in making a movie, with some of the original cast, after so many years. This movie is a good compromise of blending the nostalgia of the old, with the ideas of the new.",9
4727,"If be honest before I see this film I read about it thousands hates...so I was really interested in it)))I was waiting for everything but not for the greatest delight! Oh my Gosh, this part outdo all my hopes! So deep and full of wisdoms! Not all are ready for it. So watch and think!!!Trinity is my crush )))",10
4728,"As much as I LOVE the Matrix trilogy, this one should've been left alone. It was great to see Keanu and Carrie-Anne reunite but not this project. Sorry!",5
4729,"This is movie has no purpose, the only reason they made this movie because reboots get audience to theatre , as said one character in the movie ,the story starts with neo but writers forgot to complete his character arc, action scenes are ordinary compared to contemporary movies forgot about matrix previous movies .",5
4730,"It's evident that such a philosophical script won't be received by everyone in the same way, but that seems to have been part of the point.I found this story to be an absolutely clinical depiction of vulnerability and complacency, the benefits and terrors of connection, thought empowerment, oppression and precedents, freewill and destiny; all with the perfect amount of humor and action to keep me gleaming throughout.",10
4731,"The way they showed the boring, half-life of his life in the Matrix, the snarky tech-bro writer room ; and Trinity's life as a bored soccer mom. The way they conveyed the intense anxiety of not knowing whether you're losing your mind, or if your trip is real. The way the Analyst , like the modern ""expert"" who condescendingly tells you that there is nothing in the universe except this boring life, and hands you the ""Blue Pill"" (Prozac) to keep you in line. The way memories of your dreamworlds re-surface.The intensity of the showdown where the whole cosmos waits for Trinity's choice. You could just feel the tension in that scene. How her intuition was pulling her so strongly, but of course they bring in her belittling husband and the kids - the age-old weapons of the patriarchy to keep women in line with the patriarchal Matrix. And the writers were clearly aware of this dynamic-the Analyst says ""Women used to be so much easier to control"".There had been several other ""One's"", anomalies in the system, in the past. They all failed. The reason Neo would succeed is his alliance with Trinity. Their connection, the divine masculine, divine feminine, and the third thing, their love, creates the divine Trinity. This is the myth for the new age where it's not just the Christ, its' the love of the feminine and masculine. It's Trinity's choice upon which the fate of the species ultimately rests. The ties of family have always been an obstacle for seekers on the journey to enlightenment - that's why the Buddha left behind his householder life to ascend (of course, leaving his wife to sacrifice her own enlightenment to take care of his kids). And so, it's Trinity who remembers how to fly, not Neo- thus saving their lives.The best line of course was ""Not everyone seeks to control others, just as not everyone wants to be free"". This is such a powerful theme for our world today. In the end that's what the Matrix is about: Choice. Everyone must first consciously choose to be free before their minds can be freed. We must respect others' free will. I believe that right now in the world this is the choice each person is faced with, the crux of everything.The duality is not just man vs machine, as it was in the classic movie. Because now, there are machines on the side of choice - the gorgeous insectoid machine allies, I loved those. Just as today, when false dualities are pushed by the Matrix - man vs woman, right vs left, white vs black - but the true duality is Choice vs Control.I also loved the bit about nightmares. Why would your own mind torture you? It's the controllers, who get extra loosh from dreamers. They had to create these bleak realities for us because our minds already had too much trauma to feel comfortable with the beautiful realities they had wanted to create for us. When we are traumatized, fear and control feels comfortable and we will reject peace and beauty. ""Fear and desire, fear and desire"". That's where most consciousnesses are at all the time. And the states from which we must awaken.",10
4732,"Watching the first half hour of The Matrix: Resurrections had me holding my face. I was smiling and cheering and there were moments where I felt my mind melt with confusion about what was real and what wasn't. It was an experience that only some elite movies have achieved. I really liked it.The movie was definitely a sequel. ONLY for people who have watched the first 3 movies. And it really leans on the trilogy and it feels like it uses the previous movies to prop it up a bit.But eventually the movie must continue into the plot. This is where I believe the bad reviews come from.The movie became standard. They had a story to tell and they just told it. Nothing really amazing. But also nothing really terrible.The special effects used for the machines was perfect. But they relied on special effects for the action scenes and it lost all believability.When Trinity rides a Ducati through traffic in The Matrix: Reloaded, they used real cars. It felt like a real action scene and you could feel the scale. CGI removes this feeling.I talked to my friend and he seems to think CGI is awesome because it can bring an environment to life and show the potential of a scene.Where as I think it disconnects me from the reality and I feel I'm just watching images on a screen. So maybe this is just a matter of opinion.Bad guys were being introduced and then forgotten about. (Probably because the movie was long enough and they were cut out (maybe)).You didn't really get time to know any of the supporting characters.Looking back on the film, it felt like when I was in school and I had to write a message on a poster, and about halfway through, the letters get smaller and smaller because you didn't leave yourself enough space.",8
4733,"I don't usually take time to write reviews, but this movie deserved it.Watching this made me think that the authors stole the plot and the screenplay from the first movie and then wrote the rest.This one was specially bad. I don't even know where to begin. The plot is confusing, stupid and full of holes. The text is weak and unecessary. The action scenes are boring and you have the feeling that everything can happen.But the worst is the predicability of the plot. From the moment neo gets out you know he is going back to get trinity.",1
4734,It may have been because I wasn't expecting anything spectacular from previous reviews before watching the film. But I was pleasantly shocked to find that they managed to recreate a new plot whilst keeping elements from the original matrix. Ending was slightly cringe but that might be me. Other than that well worth watching if you enjoyed the previous movies.,10
4735,"It's always the same. Not only the producers but also the viewers love to typecast and stereotype everything. Why? Because they are lazy and also, they are after the same thing every time a new opportunity arises. Producers are after big bucks. Viewers want to 'feel' what they once felt... again and again, it's an addiction.Here, Lana does what she does best, invent new types of twists. This is more than a movie. It's a retrospective session for all of us. It goes over memories, analysis methods and more importantly, it introduces a way to wake up for real, I mean, in the real world, not in the movies.So, this is my new number two after The Matrix Reloaded. What did you say, how about the first Matrix movie? Well, it was OK, but the real deal was the next one, granted you can solve that puzzle of course ;o)",8
4736,This movie feels like a filler episode of a ten-part mini-series known as The Matrix. I wouldn't mind watching another six episodes if they can redeem the series.,5
4737,"I liked it how the movie didn't take itself serious. It does not offer any overdramatized ideas or concepts and well, it does not have as much of a breakthrough in your mind as the original matrix had, but I had a feeling that that's exactly what Lana Wachowski was trying to do. It's easy going, fun-based and overall fun to watch. That can be a bad thing for many but not for me. I enjoyed every bit of it!",8
4738,"I honestly believe the Wachowskis are ahead of their time when it comes to their films. This was no different, and I believe most negative reviews are from a wary audience strained from pandemics and politics.The message is so one the nose it's totally out of focus. If anything it's a way point in how far off society has drifted from reality (there's that word again) since the last films and it's spot on.Everyone played their part, and I really hope this franchise continues. Are the action scenes the ground breaking? No, but you'd never be able to recreate what the first films delivered... and they rightly did not bother to try. In fact, the look was closer to cheesy video game graphics... a conscious choice I believe.All in all I enjoyed the film, the nostalgia, and would recommend.",9
4739,"Story is not convincing..Characters have no believable motivation.Actions and VFXs are not impressed and lack of imagination.However Neo has a purpose in the whole movie and driving the whole movie forward, so the pacing is actually fine.",5
4740,"So I just watched this yesterday and actually liked it. The Matrix being in my top 5 movies of all time, this movie didn't come close to that but the story is good.It gives some fresh ideas and has some decent action but.... it's just not as epic as the original. The lobby shootout and helicopter crash from the first are the most breathtaking and epic action scenes ever filmed in my hontest opinion.Neil Patric Harris is really the villian in this one and is actually pretty good... they honestly should of left agent Smith out especially since Hugo Weaving couldn't be cast.So all this being said I'd like to see another one but with both Directors back and some epic action which the originals are known for. Even Reloaded had the epic Merovigian room fight and the freeway chase with the semi truck crash!",8
4741,"I thought I was watching this movie for 1 hour and then realized it's been only 10 minutes. Why did they decide to make a movie without any story, I would never understand. There is pathetic action attempt, silly dialogues (like Trinity/Tiffany saying she wanted to break Chad's jaw. I thought a 5 year old wrote that) and half of the movie was footages from previous movies. I mean if I want to watch Matrix 1, I would go and watch Matrix 1. At the end of the day the question remains, why make a movie when you have nothing to show? 1/10 because there isn't an option to put 0.",1
4742,"Not a bad effort but not The Matrix, matrix flavour more like.It tries to bind, intrigue, move and wow but as soon as the plot thickens, it fizzes out.Hugo Wallace Weaving said no to Smith wow ... resurrection! Alas not always a blessed miracle.",5
4743,"Spoiler alert.I thought the movie was pretty good. Wachowski did what she could to bring the story further. You can see it serves as a healing process for her as it steers clear of any real emotional losses. What I didn't like was that little time was taken to explain how Trinity was The One instead of Neo. I don't dislike the switch, just that by the time it happens towards the end of the movie, I didn't feel invested into this decision. Perhaps the focus was to present this as a love story angle which could explain why Neo believing in Trinity was what convinced her to be The One. But it sounds a little hollow. The advance of technology and some machines joining humans was a nice touch. Overall I enjoyed it, but it is far over shadowed by the original Matrix.",7
4744,"Just a money grab. Too Hollywood. Didn't even had the characteristic green tint. The original felt closed up. Even outdoors it felt like a closed space. Not this one. Disappointed but at the same time not. Like, it was expected. The story was already stretched on The Matrix revolutions so a 4th part didn't seem like it would work. And it didn't.",
4745,"The original trilogy had two main philosphical themes.Free will vs determinism.1. Reality vs simulation vs simulacra.2. Free will vs determinism.The Matrix resurrections gives you fifty or so 'I member' moments in the first thirty minutes. You think this movie is just a simulation of the original. The opening scene is basically a shot for shot remake with trinity in the room fighting the policemen from the opening of the original movie. How they managed to make this look worse than the original movie which is now over 20 years old is a work of genius. You see, the further down the rabbit hole you get with this movie you realise... it is not a simulation of the original but a simulacra. Time and rose tinted glasses has made the orignal matrix untouchable in effect on the viewer. Nothing a director can do now will ever blow my mind like the first did 20 years ago. However, a 15 year old watching the original now will probably not see any difference between the original and resurrections in impact. Ressurections is a copy of something that never existed but in our minds. The original is just a movie.The second point of free will vs determinism plays out by how terrible this movie is. You could stay and be subjected to blue hair mary sue doing her little quips and slowly punching agents while roly pollying away. You can stay and listen to such classic lines as 'are you going to bang my mom?' and 'you know our parent company Warner brothers'. You may begin to feel not everything is right. Perhaps there is another path to take, perhaps you can break free from what is expected of you. Perhaps you can walk out after an hour of this movie because your time on this earth is limited and you can choose how you spend those moments.I genuinely believe this movie is as bad as it is deliberately, as a meta commentary of the passive consumption of media and how we can take the red pill if we do not like a piece of art. After watching for an hour I took the red pill, stood up, walked out and I can tell you it was incredibly liberating. I unplugged myself from the matrix.",5
4746,"Obviously you can't make a sequel 20 years later and not reference the original trilogy but this movie does do that quite often for the first hour in forms of flickers of the originals and character dialogue.The film itself is watchable to some degree but it seems to go from drawn-out, sometimes confusing dialogue to all out action in a split second.Keanu Reeves' docile form of acting is at the forefront once again, a performance to which he doesn't seem to put much effort into.As for the plot, like the newer Star Wars movies, it pretty much undoes everything prior to it with some mild explanation as to what happened to everyone after the events of Revolutions.The last 30 minutes felt rushed as we spend the majority of the movie trying to find out why Neo can't remember anything, then suddenly remembers everything and then decides that his personal mission to free Trinity takes precedent over the rest of the human race.Finally Trinity, after forgetting who she is, then suddenly remembers everything which leads to the final slapdash 30 minutes.There are hints of humour in the movie that feel out of place and it didn't really feel like a Matrix movie. The originals came out at a time when people were trying to get to grips with changing technologies and the fear of the information age (i.e. Big Brother). But unfortunately this movie offers nothing new.See it to say you've seen it but don't put it next to the original trilogy in your DVD collection.",6
4747,"I just finished watching it and i have to say keep your expectations low and you will enjoy it, because it wasnt meant to be a breakthrough movie(again) it is exactly what it should be, just an entertaining watch. But definetely watch it because the story aint that bad and the action pretty decent.",6
4748,"It's a pity that Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne aren't in the movie. The effects in some scenes look artificial compared to today, but the story was good. When I first saw the comments about the movie, I asked myself: ""Should I not go to watch the movie?"" but I went. And then I said: ""Luckily I went to watch it."" Overall the movie doesn't deserve this rating, it's better than the third movie. I think movie got such a score because his story progressed a bit slow.",7
4749,"I have to start with, I don't understand why this film has such a bad rep, apart from the fact that it's probably just too intelligent for at least 60% of the audience.The first 30-45 mins of the film are admittedly very very self aware, you either see that or you don't and you either love it or hate it. Once the film gets started however that self awareness falls by the way side and you can sit back and enjoy it for what it is.The other point that I can't help but feel is lost on people is the 'recasting' of Morpheus and Agent Smith. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN RECAST, THEY ARE THE SAME CHARACTERS IN DIFFERENT SKINS. Let me explain, in the Matrix they're are 4 intrinsically linked characters Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and Agent Smith. Trinity is the love of Neo's life, Agent Smith is the Neo's opposite and without Morpheus they're is no Neo, so yes the link is surprisingly Neo. Now the film does explain why Neo and Trinity are THE Neo and Trinity but Morpheus and Agent Smith can and should be interchangeable. Simply put in every version of the Matrix they're is THE ONE (Neo) which means that they're will also be the love of their lives (Trinity), they're opposite (Agent Smith), and the mentor (Morpheus). As I've mentioned the film does explain Keanu and Carrie Anne being Neo and Trinity but as for Morpheus and Agent Smith, if they had kept the original casting Im sure the film would have been far too familiar and I'm also sure people would have hated this film more because of it.",9
4750,"The Matrix resurrected is definitely a Matrix movie. It's got the actors (exept morpheus), the music is on point and it continues on from the iconic trilogy. However, this film feels rather empty. The things that happened in the last scenes of the previous matrix movie were in some ways undone, which makes it feel rather dull. The movie felt longer than it actually was, which is about 2,5 hours, and the start of the movie was rather slow.",5
4751,"Absolute matrix fan over here, didn't expect it to be as great as the original, but the outcome was a waste of my time.I'm sorry for to the actors, they did great, so did the visual team.Storyline: 2acting: 8visuals: 10matrix1-3 vibe: 4everything inside the matrix: 3everything outside the matrix: 8.",4
4752,"Yeah, I know there is a trend to experiment with old material (because, lack of creativity) and most of the times, it fails. (e.g., Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Terminator, Superman movies), but there is also some genuine effort (e.g., Star Trek, Mission Impossible, Spider man movies, Batman movies). And remember, filmmakers don't always make movies for the 'fans' only. They also have to cater to today's audiences. That is why, with changing times, we won't always get the same 'feel'.This story isn't about 'the end of the world', but a minor hiccup in the state of things. Still, there is enough detailing. And Matrix movies are not only about aesthetics (clothing style and action), there is an existential storyline going on behind everything. That is intact.The sheeple have gotten used to calling every reboot 'trash', but just use some critical thinking. This franchise calls for it.",7
4753,"Lana Wachowski is the author of the story and the way she decided to continue might be the only appropriate option that could be implemented. Why not? Everything more or less was within the universe rulles of the previous parts.This is not the end of the matrix story in general, but at least this is a happy end love story. Evil never should have defeated unconditional love in the first place, under any circumstances.",10
4754,Why everybody hates this movie it's not bad YOU KNOW watch carefully no disturbing you will enjoy this tells the story of neo returning to the matrix when morfius finds him and tells him the truth.,8
4755,Very cleverly written script the reason people didnt like it is that they didnt get it the first time i would suggest watch it few more times because this is the new enviorment/version of matrixI hope there will be another sequel so that more minds can be freedMorpheus was the best character if you get what he is.,8
4756,"If you're cis, your opinion about your movie is... there. That's it. It's there. It is a thing that exists. It is also utterly irrelevant. The emotional resonance this movie provides trumps any rational analysis. You either know or you don't. It's been a long time since I cried because of a movie. Cathartic and insightful.",10
4757,"This film is not trash but not great either. Not good for a Matrix film. The first was perfect in almost every way. Though the sequels were criticised, it was confusing initially but I have loved them more, especially Reloaded, with multiple rewatches. The philosophy, the metaphor, and the whole plot was just great. This film, sadly doesn't reach the greatness of the trilogy.The opening scenes were intriguing. Some humor felt overdone. Lots of flashback scenes were used. Some were good callbacks and were a nostalgia for fans. Soon, it felt overdone. The meta element was cool and unique but they drop it in the first act after which the plot didn't quite interest me.The action scenes did disappoint. Gone are the breathtaking, long take, well choreographed fight scenes. Fights are short and edited badly. Not disgusting but mediocre for a Matrix fight. Not a single standout fight scene. KEANU has aged but he could do well. Watch no more than John Wick to realise that. Some moments are really good but you don't have to cut around frikkin KEANU REEVES in a fight scene.New Morpheus was okay, but felt like a parody. He soon was reduced into just a minor charcter, which I didn't like. New Smith was also similar. They eventually lost purpose overall.This film feels like an epilogue to the original trilogy. I haven't understood all but I guess I will appreciate more with rewatches. It is just satisfactory. Could have been a lot better. Hope fans will have a nice time with this one.",6
4758,"There were some great bits in this film, unfortunately those were all cut from previous Matrix films. This movie didn't add anything, except for Keanu Reeves acting like he has a jacket potato up his rear for two and a half hours. Take the blue pill and don't watch this.",5
4759,"It was entertaining and got a few laughs, but seemed like it was a script written by a committee. So it resembled garbage you would see in a comic book movie over science fiction. It was uneeded to the story. Unlike the original trilogy, there not really anything at stake. This seemed more meta commentary about the original series while bringing Neo and Trinity back. Now all they need is a four hour sequel where they have YouTubers going over all the Easter eggs we missed.",6
4760,"Comparing it to the first Matrix is probably not fair, since this is a sequel. It wouldn't work as a standalone movie.For what it's worth, it is a good sci-fi action movie. The script is consistent with the Matrix mythology, and brings it to a satisfying conclusion. The first half of the movie can feel a bit sluggish, but it picks up some pace in the second half. If you have the chance, I'd say go watch it.",7
4761,"In the beginning i wanna say that what an honor to watch a Matrix movie in a cinema it was a really good experience to watch it in a cinema and i really recommend every to watch it in a theatre to enjoy every thing in the movie, i think that the consequence of the scenes isn't well-arranged not like the first ones, sometimes i feel bored and sometimes i feel like i can break the wall , the sound and visual effects are good of course , there was some surprises for me appeared in the movie and i really got shocked seeing 'em ,At last The Matrix Resurrection can be titled as good movie.",
4762,"It has been 18 years since the last movie and I think, they did a great job, to finally set a worthy ending to it.It felt like the first movie but with a little twist.The chaotic action scenes, the quick transitions between the ""realities"".It may not be perfect for everyone, however for me as a ""matrix newbie"" and even some ""older"" fans, it has been a great experience with just the right amount of action and confusion while maintaining the original feeling of the previous movies.In my opinion, it is one of the best sequels so far.",9
4763,"The Matrix Resurrections wasn't a terrible movie by any means, but it was boring, despite all the action. I appreciated the nostalgia and some of the characters but overall, the movie just felt like an unnecessary sequel to a series that already had a pretty decent ending in an attempt to milk more money out of the brand. If you already have HBO Max and really wanna watch the movie, I recommend watching it there versus spending more money to see it at theaters.",6
4764,"Watching the the matrix saga is a steady drop in quality. You start in the first with a masterpiece, and gradualy go down the levels until you reach a jumbled piece, that doesn't make sence.The movie has no cohesion, the story is cringy and forced upon the viewer. Ressurection is a great title because the story was finished, and still it was dug from its grave and presened poorlyNot worth watching.",2
4765,"Slow pace from the beginning but second part od the movie was phenomenall..real matrix movie. Worth watching ! Dialogues ,theme,action scenes also phenomenal in the second part.",7
4766,"I enjoyed this sequel. It cleverly brought back Neo with decent moments of humors, actions, and ""modernizations"" of Matrix. But in the end, the movie suffers from two major weaknesses.First, this sequal lacks the sense of impending doom and danger that was heavy in the Trilogy. After the secrets were revealed in the first half, the suspense evaporated. As result, the ensuing actions felt empty and unsatisfying.Secondly, besides the chemistry between Neo and Trinity, the connection to the new cast is superficial, underdeveloped, and non-existence. In the original Trilogy, every death was emotional and impactful and, especially the ones involving betrayal. Who died in this movie? I don't recall.If you liked the original Matrix, then this sequel is worth watching. I only wish the story was brought to the same level as the original. Hopefully Wachowski will do that in Matrix 5.",8
4767,"Don't mind the negative reviews, just watch it. If you truly understand the first one, you'll love this one too. Well, if you don't understand this one, sorry, but you didn""t understand the first movie either.",10
4768,What was left to the imagination in Revolutions comes to a complete full circle and also opens the door to more movies to completely peel the onion. There is still a full human race to free up!,9
4769,"""After all these years, to be going back to where it all started. Back to The Matrix!"" isn't that an exiting quote?It's self aware, world aware, provocative, innovative and yet very familiar movie. Upgraded surroundings, effects, colors and clarity. A lot of natural light and shadows, beautiful shots. Worth watching a few times. Loved acting by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jonathan Groff, Jessica Henwick, Priyanka Chopra Jonas. Those people brought new colors to the franchise. The care for the old and new characters is felt in every shot. The story is relatable in a new way and it speaks to a nowadays audience perfectly.After watching this movie, the first trilogy feels more rational and calculated by comparison. While this one feels more human. Less philosophy, more love I would say. Less guns, more connection.And I appreciate it that way.",10
4770,This movie is a lot of fun if you're a fan of the others. Really interesting to see the aftermath of the third film with great martial arts actions and stunning sci fi visuals. If people went into something like this with a more open mind I think they would enjoy it a lot more. It's very entertaining! Hope to see the gang back for another.,10
4771,"The movie had me engrossed and into it right until they met jada pinketts character and then it took a massive nosedive.Truly the writers of the matrix only have made 1 great movie and that is the matrix itself, they have had decent ideas in later films but it is like they are on 10 types of drugs when writing.Matrix 2 and 3 ruined the franchise, I only see matrix as being the first film, even though 2 and 3 had great ideas, 4 is the same, good ideas but execution if off and I got bored halfway though. Part 4It should have been rebooted not ressurected but, I would say matrix is the star wars of the 90's/2000's, you cannot out do a classic.Cast was so so, story was so so, would I watch it again? No. Did it make a mark on me? No. Just a pointless film to add to the ridiculous pointless folklore that the watchoskis created.Watch it if you are a fan but do not expect innovation or a great and engrossing story.",4
4772,"Can't understand why some reviewers disliked this movie. Even after twenty years this movie has you still wondering about the nature of reality.Great story with solid acting all around. If you are a Matrix fan you will not be disappointed. Movie is a little long, and takes a litle time to develop but is well worth it.",8
4773,"I enjoy the movie through and through. People is complaining about how its not as good as the original and mediocre and such. Nothing made after is ever as good as the originals. Sure I miss the symbolism and the cult like cinematography of the first 3, but you can't dismiss an beautifully made movie just because it doesnt answer your unrealistic expectations.Manage your expectations and watch it for what it is: a resurrection of a 20 year old idea that we fell in love with. We grew up, the cast grew up, the idea grew up. Enjoy it for what it is: an excellent sci fi movie.",8
4774,What an amazing surprise.(obviously aside from the few leftist topics thrown around in that brainstorm room...(or is this simply an accurate reflection of gaming studios...)I was so scared what this movie could have been- but now that i gave it a shot &amp; watched it i am thankful.This displays to the world- the biblically accurate understanding of The Davidic Messiah- The Adam- being comprised of Male &amp; Female that are ONE. Without one HALF there is no other half. They go together- &amp; together they unite &amp; reach higher consciousness &amp; prophecy &amp; power &amp; create life.Based on the writings of Rabbi Joel David Bakst (RJDB) in the name of The Vilna Gaon- it became clear to meNeo dying in the war is the dark prophecy of The Messiah Son of Josseph dying in the war- though the Vilna Gaon points out this negative prophecy was annulled due to such a long seemingly endless exile that we find ourselves in today.Neo &amp; Trinity together would resemble The Messiah Son of David - that is a direct descendant of The Adam- (Adam &amp; Hava/Eve That were created AS ONE in the love embrace. &amp; The Goal of evil is to split them apart and keep them apart and confuse their minds- so they do not even remember they are literally missing their other half- that when they unite they rise to the level of The Adam &amp; Become ONE flesh &amp; Emulate God's Unity- ONE = MaleFemaleUnited that create life &amp; reach new powers &amp; dimensions.That was my first watch...but i dont think matrix fans &amp; TruthSeekers- Followers of The Infinite ONE would be disappointed.,8
4775,Hass to be good enoughLong time coming I want to love it I wanted to be in a m Matrix again It did not work for me I'm sorry to say but I'm still glad I saw it thank God I was at home always view oh Max sorry I feel like I wasted no money just sometime.,7
4776,"According to me, The film was really bad. My expectations about the movie (which was good ones) disappeared like 30 minutes in when the movie start getting Boring!",2
4777,"You have to see this movie not expecting to find something new, we are now playing with different iterations in stories, and this one it is about that precisely, a lot of hate is throwed here for some people, we are now in hunger to destroy everything with vicious comments so i have faith that if they make more about this new universe, a way to thank the creators for giving us such a wonderful story, I will see them all.",10
4778,"As someone in treatment with cPTSD, I have to say this is the most accurate depiction trauma therapy and dissociative disorder treatment that I've ever seen in film. This movie has a lot of ideas, maybe as many as the first film, but I'm not sure everyone is going to relate to them this time. I enjoyed the slower pace. The talks where his therapist tells him to focus on the details in the space around him, the feel of his pants against his hands, and the seat against his body (somatic experiencing/cognitive processing therapy). As a viewer I was able to connect to with Neo for the first time. He's no longer essentially a deity discovering his omnipotent skills inside (and outside) The Matrix. He's human this time, and I really enjoy that. The risks are real because he's lost his mojo. From a strictly action movie review perspective... I'm a fan of Reloaded and Revolutions too. I have been since I watched the Cornel West commentary many, many years ago. This film feels like it lands somewhere between part one and part two. If you didn't like Reloaded, I cannot imagine you'll like this. There are a lot of hateful scores on here. I've noticed some people pointing out choppy action sequences. I'm sure this can be explained by Keanu's age and more limitations in his physical movement. The one star reviews are unwarranted. My experience is people often enter sequels with too much expectation and it ruins it for them. This movie also has a Metacritic score nearly identical to the second installment. Curb your enthusiasm and enjoy the ride. This is the second best of the series. B+",8
4779,The movie was better than what I expected. The story was a good reason to bring the characters back and in the beginning you're a bit lost but be patient because things actually clear up. I wanted to see more Trinity fighting scenes as tin he first 3 movies Trinity had the best action scenes. I hope they will be a sequel to this. I want more!,9
4780,"Could have been 2 stars more, better Smith and no cover band for RATM!!!Other then that, trilogie is better ....but this is a nice edition to the franchise.",7
4781,"First half is on a slower side as there's lots of dialogue and story explaining going on (for younger audience I guess).Much better action in second half.If this is an ""episode 1"" of a new trilogy, then get a Director who can make this exciting to watch - like 2nd Terminator or Elisium movies.",7
4782,"Maybe it is unfair to rate a movie only based on a character, but please see the film again and this time only follow the white rabbit. Three cheers for Bugs!",10
4783,"Wow! This latest installment is an absolute masterpiece and the best movie I've seen in years. The acting was excellent, CGI was mind-blowing and the action was just something to behold! The story was genius and very easy to understand. All in all, I was thoroughly entertained even more than I was back in 1999 when the first Matrix was released. Absolute perfection which has raised the bar in filmmaking. MCU, eat your heart out!",10
4784,"Resurrections should not have been made. So many plot holes and revisioned nonsense it's not worth your time. The Matrix was excellent, Reloaded was slightly better than ok, Revolutions was blah, Resurrections is older versions of Characters rehashing the same old same old.",4
4785,After being a huge fan of the original matrix trilogy I was super excited for this and even more excited after Keanus rolls as John wick I was even more excited after playing the unreal engine 5 tech demo on ps5 but after viewing I'm not sure what to say it has its moments where it shines through with some genuine brilliance and has a incredible story and premise clearly there but hasn't been fully realised or had enough attention and care applied.,5
4786,"This movie is a total disaster. It used tons of flash back and a new conventional story to conduct a so-call sequel for the legendary movie. It is a waste of time to watch this film, and the only purpose of this film is to bring Neo and Trinity back.",1
4787,"I didn't expect much from this film, but about 10min in I knew I was in for a treat! Much like the original movie, it's a clever commentary on society, our relationship with technology and nostalgia, current day filmmaking and our personal notions of reality. It deals with the legacy of its predecessors, nature vs nurture, destiny vs free will.But ultimately it is a heartwarming love story!While many reviews will tell you things along the likes of ""the sequel nobody asked for"", it's clear that in many ways this is also the sequel the creators didn't want to make, but were faced with the reality of ""this will get made with or without you"" and decided to make the best of it. And they surely did!While some motivations (especially behind the inciting action) were unclear, the film succeeds in entertaining and provoking thought!And yes, it isn't as visually groundbreaking as the original but it seems unfair to expect the creators to change cinema twice.",8
4788,"I don't know how anyone can not like this movie. Absolutely brilliant comeback. Clever and not a minute wasted on action, nostalgia and great new story. I want more! Love Neo and Trinity's struggle to be together, trying to save each other's life. Their love for each other. We have them back! Let's see where this new story takes us!",10
4789,"What would happen if the matrix continued? What would become of people inside and outside the matrix? How would it be the personal evolution of people who went through the facts of the first 3 movies? This fourth film managed to answer all these questions, with an adult and realistic look. Without as many fantasies as the first three films, but with the view that it's all a computer system. Everything becomes clear and easy to understand if you understand a little bit of computer programming, just like the first three films did. Seeing events from a system's point of view brings a mixed understanding and great care was taken by the producers so that it wasn't totally robotic, fitting in with characters with unique personalities. This last movie evolved all that. Perhaps the large volume of audiences cannot see the grandeur of evolution and how it has made people more careful and, from a cinematic point of view, more tedious, but totally realistic. This film is the dignified and realistic continuation of human growth.",10
4790,I thought after 20 years they would somehow figure out what made #1 great and 2/3 subpar. They didn't. I literally almost dozed off a few times. The characters are old and they changed the rules quite a bit.,6
4791,"Senseless violence, check. Guns, check. Explosions, check. Bullet-time, check. Keanu Reeves, check. The new entry for ""The Matrix"" franchise will satisfy fans, even though the lore is slightly altered. This film doesn't just have mind-blowing action but a plot that is extremely clever. Take it from me, you'll LOVE this film!",7
4792,"Maybe, people commenting here is so TRAPPED in the matrix that they just CAN´T SEE what I saw when I watched this movie.Or, maybe, it´s not very convenient that too much people think in some premises this movie expose.Sadly, some sheeps just see ""an action movie"" :)I really think is so (¡SO!) much than that.Maybe, they still didn´t wake up ;)",8
4793,"I'm so tired of the movie time we are in. Originality is almost gone. So many sequels and reboots. This movie is more of the same. WB went as far as making sure their whole studio name was mentioned is this movie. Space Jam 2 was bad enough! The original Matrix movies were dark, depressing, hint of horror with notes of steam punk and terminator vibes. This movie...I don't even know. It was bright, cocky, lighthearted. After they introduced Neo and did his whole story again the movie was skipping through anything short of a story to just build upon a crappy love story. So now the matrix goes from man verse machine and the fight for survival and freedom to a half written love story. I was more excited then I wanted to let know that Neo was coming back. I don't know if it was just crappy writing or WB couldn't just sit back and let the professionals do their jobs but man this was one of the most disappointing movies I have seen.",3
4794,"And like pizza...well, even when it's bad...it's still pretty good!I see way too many people went into this with very high expectations, and who can blame them? The first one was simply, iconic...a game-changer, mind-blowing to the nth degree.The second and third sequels? Well, like another reviewer wrote: Let's not talk about those (special effects on top of the 18-wheelers were good though).But thanks to all the crappy reviews from various media sources...I went in with low expectations, and I'm glad I did. I enjoyed trying to figure out what was happening, not that it required much, but it kept me engaged. Then I was interested in finding out whether any of my assumptions of what was going on might run into a twist of some sort. That didn't really happen, at least not in a big way.I'm reminded of how Eddie Murphy joked about how some women often withhold sex, and when you finally get it...it's really great. He goes on to say it's like giving a starving man a cracker, and the man eats it up like it's the best cracker he's ever eaten!Well my friends, we've been stuck with relatively little in the way of seeing really good entertainment over the nearly two years of this pandemic...and we're starving for really good entertainment. I mean, at this point we'll take whatever we can get (Wandavision, Hawkeye, 10 rings, etc.). Not great stuff, but at least a little entertaining. Certainly better than nothing!Finally, for those who've bashed this movie to pieces: A - Sorry your expectations were so high, and B - If you can write a better movie, then do it, and stop yer whining!",9
4795,"I simply had to make an account just to say this, ok maybe 9/10 seems a bit too much but per total it's a solid 8! There are a few moments when it feels like they are over-using guns and explosions but the movie is 100% worth watching and it even brings some new perspectives and ideeas that were missing from the original 3 movies. Sure, they're kinda milking it a bit but it's decent. The story is enjoyable to watch, I personaly liked it.What I can't explain though is what exactly are bullets and fire weapons suppose to represent in this world anyway since they're obviously of no real use and almost never get the job done.",9
4796,"The almost matrix feeling. I say this because while I was watching this movie, in parts it almost felt like matrix but just fails all together. I was losing interest in some parts of the movie. The end was pretty good action and in parts felt a little like the original matrix but its not as captivating as the original. They do introduce new things but some of it just wasn't related to a matrix style movie. A big let down. Also it has like a zombie type style to it which I did not like at all. Its an insult to the original matrix. The villains in this movie are so boring its a disgrace. Bring back the original Mr. Anderson or at least more effective villains or none at all. I mean Neil Patrick Harris and Jonathan Groff REALLY? They are like the worst actors ever, they could have found way better Mr. Anderson and also another villain.RIP Matrix.",3
4797,"I'm a huge fan of the Matrix, I actually loved every single movie of the original triology and also watched Animatrix, which was equally great.I had great hopes for this and for the first few minutes into the movie I had a good feeling. But then it quickly turned into a slide that ultimately led down into a pool of cheese.First of all the whole story is an uncreative reboot with gaping plot holes. They're like ""Oh turns out that ending wasn't the end."". But a lot of explanation is missing. For instance the movie never mentions why and how the machines killed Neo and Trinity at the end of the last trilogy. It only mentions they're resurrected and then put back into the Matrix to study them. Which doesn't really make a lot of sense to me.If you listen to the dialogues, there is a very obvious clue that Lana Wachowski didn't even want to make a successor but WarnerBros probably still got her on a contract. In the Movie it's Neo who created the Matrix computer game and WB forces him under his contract to make another installment although he didn't want to. Weird coincidence? You'll be the judge.In the end there's not a lot to remember from this flick. The action sequences are boring and uncreative. Keanu Reeves dozes his way through majority of the movie like a homeless person on valium. The new Agent Smith has the scary factor of a flower Pokemon and the same goes for his ally Neil Patrick Harris. All other characters like Morpheus and Bug are super shallow. And on top the uber-cheesy love story between Neo and Trinity, that the movie evolves around.Conclusion: I'm glad I watched this on HBO Max. Had I spent money on this, I'd be mad. Dear Warner: How about new ideas instead of rehashing old ones. You can use the Matrix universe, but please just give us something new. New characters, a new storyline. It can't be that hard, can it?",3
4798,"I had mostly high hopes for the film and was generally impressed with the visuals of the movie. The main issue is it kept getting in its own way with a forced cleverness and and breaking 4th wall so many times it became redundant and predictable. I also have no idea why they decided to keep with the previous rules for some characters, while totally breaking the rules for other previous characters (ala Agent/Morpheus who didn't know he was Morpheus and neither did the other agents). This muddies up the development and turns the film into a mash of cut and paste Matrix-esqe parts with a new coat of paint that isn't the same shade. Hopefully, they leave things as they are and not mess up a good story even further.",6
4799,"It took me three evenings to watch it through. It's not that it was sooo bad, it was just very average b-movie. I just waited for the new matrix for such a long time.... and it builds an expectation....i'm starting to think the scenario for the original matrix was stolen by the Wachowskis. It cant be that the material for this mediocre stuff and the original movie was written by the same person....",4
4800,"Something just didn't seem right with it, like it wasn't in their heart to make it good, some light humour in it which I didn't think suited this type of movie at all, he looked like he just got out of a set with john wick and didn't change for the role, the story was not that great either and not a fan of the actors they choose for Mr smith etc, they should of no bothered making any more.",6
4801,"I Watch it at afternoon, it blow my mind with opening sequences. Then it began with All About De Javu and another split Story from The Matrix 1-2-3. No more question but, the cinematography is wonderfull, but not incredible as the first film. Young Agent Smith and Morpheus has played quite well and Carrie anne moss play swiftly with Same Act.With some Nostalgia and New Story, The Matrix 4 make me wonder how they can make world in reality or virtual?",9
4802,"I like this one,maybe to many new characters in the begging made it confusing, I was a little lost at the beginning and then I understand everything hahahaha it was good and I enjoyed.",8
4803,"For me this, is one of the better sequels. The action scenes may not be as superb but the movie itself is subtle and intelligent. It actually has some unexpected soul, which is more than I can say for the third movie. Overall, rather deep and quite enjoyable.",8
4804,"Hi! The subject is amazing! But the director reflected this in the movie. In front of us stands a confused director. In addition, they could not reflect the seriousness of the first three series of the movie here.",6
4805,"I don't know what all the fuss is about...the critics are unnecessarily too critical on this latest addition to the trilogy.Having said that Hugo Weaving (The Original Agent Smith) was sorely missed in this movie...I can say for certain that his presence would have changed the whole mood of the film.Neil Patrick Harris was a misfit for the role he was given.. he just can not portray a sinister character.. he was supremely successful in How I Met your Mother only because his eyes are able to project sarcasm and comedy at the same time and the same was true when he played the analyst.. he was more bent towards projection of sarcasm rather than menace. I can only imagine Agent Smith turning out to be The Analyst or at least someone with real purpose ..rather he was like a Phone a friend on Who wants to be a millionaire.The Laurence Fishburne look alike was too hard bent towards comedy he definitely lacked the depth required to represent Morpheus.Scenes like the classic Nokia 8110 click to slide phone were sorely missed.. I guess Neo went to using the old people phone with the large buttons because his vision had weakened over the years.Overall I felt that the casting choice was not that thorough...the actors just did not have the ""faces"" (for lack of a better description) that fit the aesthetic of 'The Matrix'... Neo and Trinity still got it though.The costumes were not as flashy as they were in the previous movies neither were the cars or bikes flashy enough.Finally, anyone who wants to truly enjoy this movie should see the previous 3 and make it a one big movie marathon. It definitely gets plus points for the nostalgia.",7
4806,"While meta jokes can be annoying, the questions about why they're happening are interesting. Did the matrix really happen, and is Neo just channelling it into a game? Or was it just a game? I believe it pushes the first answer, but I'm not 100% sure.The severity of the amount of jokes is greatly pushed. There are few jokes. But, they are only in the first half. The movie stays serious throughout the rest.The new villain to come does also provide enough tension. It's better than a marvel movie, and it feels like people just gave up, and expected the worst.It's a slightly confusing plot, but if you listen, it makes perfect sense. Few lines feel really forced, and all lines are tolerable.Not as good as no. 1, but just as good as 2 and 3, and it works as a good sequel. I also like 2 and 3, which are also greatly underrated movies. They aren't as bad as you think.",8
4807,Movie is ok ok.. i like first part only. This part is same as 2nd and 3rd. You can watch it just to see neo and trinity back. Missing old morpheiois character.,6
4808,"And haven't been black pilled... you should appreciate this. It's not a reboot, its am exaltation that can only happen when boy meets girl and dedicates his life after life after life to her.",7
4809,"White Rabbit. Same song used in the movie ""The game"" from 1997. Same state of desillusion and not know what is with yor life, in both movies. So, any connection between two directors of the movies? Both caracters in both movies were searching for ""white rabbits"".",8
4810,"No words - absolutely in awedont understand it - feel it. For a task of that magnitude, this not only takes it to the next level in what we get visually - it also mirrors us, all of us in such a warming loving way that its eye opening.Will watch this many times again!I laughed - I was wowed - I was surprised - I was questioning - exactly just like it is looking in the mirror.Big Love.",10
4811,"Let's be honest, the matrix reputation comes from the first movie, a true sci fi revolutionary masterpiece. The sequels did not keep it up, and Resurrections just kicked the whole thing downhill.There were so many possibilities to explore for another matrix plot, but Hollywood being Hollywood, milking the franchise cow seems to be more important than ever. So we get half the original cast for a half standard of a movie that takes you absolutely nowhere new. This is no longer a great sci fi movie playing with human nature and mind, it's now a bad romance flick happening in an updated steampunk scenario.The new Morpheus deserves special mention. His horrible performance basically destroyed that solid, unique character laid out by Fishburne. It's like they told a teenager to throw as many bad acid jokes as he could on himself playing Morpheus. You didn't understand? Me neither. But the Morpheus on this movie, you'll feel that you've probably seem him at a Halloween party sometime in the last 20 years.I am sorry to inform you that The Matrix has died after a long fight against poor scripting.",2
4812,I cant believe what I just witnessed !Too much bad choices were made in this movie !Yahya Abdul as Morpheus ?!Jonathan Groff as Agent Smith ?!Matrix 4 just disappointed me and if you are a true fan of matrix you will be disappointed too !,5
4813,"The movie was done in 2003 , no need to reboot it, didn't work for Star Wars... when something is done, it's done, why trying to complete perfect. Just runes what you have done in the past.",5
4814,"For anyone who loves this franchise, this chapter serves a beautiful way to answer the questions that many of us had after the trilogy ended: Did Neo save the human race? If so, at what cost? Did the Matrix continue to exist? If so, what version of it?Do yourself a favour and ignore the haters. This movie was a beautiful extension of the Matrix universe.",10
4815,"After reading two extremely negative reviews, I felt compelled to write this. Following some contemplation, I surmised their exceedingly negative viewpoints must have been borne from an extreme level of admiration for the first one and an unrealistic expectation of what the fourth installment would be.The overall theme of my review is this: It was not some money grab and another ill-fated sequel destined to let the franchise's most devoted fans down. Rather, it was a nice, nostalgic trip down memory lane which addressed the overriding theme of the original film back in 99 well. How do we know what's real?There are truly iconic lines that will be etched into cinema history. The performances are decent. The action sequences are great. I must admit the story is a bit predictable. I'm disappointed Hugo Weaving reportedly did not reprise his role due to a ""scheduling"" conflict. And, the absence of Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheus was heartbreaking.If you're on the fence about watching this movie, just approach it with an open mind. In my opinion, the film does not just annihilate the legacy of the first one and act as a pathetic thief of your money. Don't go in there expecting it to be an immaculate Francis Ford Coppola-esque film, either.",6
4816,"Despite all possible downsides of the plot, I still give this film the best rating just because I want to believe that love to the world, people and life itself will conquer anything. I want to believe in the second chance... Right now it gives me the fuel to believe in a sort of happy end. I helps to keep my spirit up.",10
4817,"After reading some critical reviews, I was worried. Fortunately Ressurections is still an iconic, deep and cult film. Of course nostalgic scenes for the old fans are included, the scenario IMO is the best one after Matrix 1 (and equal to 2) and there are a lot of MULTIPLE levels of the plot in the movie. I think this was the biggest problem for some old school fans that nowadays are considerably older and as life goes sometimes more conservative. I think they don't get all the ""meta"" levels of the film. The only weakness.of the plot is that a considerable info at.the middle of the film may lead to less tension about Neos fate (surving or not).The acting is very convincing. The photography has many top moments and the costumes are still amazing.The new Matrix focuses on the main theme of its predecessors: what is reality, what is a fake?Integrating a psychiatric treatment, which is very realistic depicted, adds value to the Matrix mythology.Yes, they don't invent Cinema new like the old films. But Ressurections does it's best to step on the shoulders of a giant and expand our horizon even further.",9
4818,"The writing was lazy in regards to The Matrix plotline. It didnt answer any questions and instead was a middle finger to WB trying to ""resurrect"" a franchise that was more or less finished. I saw it in the theater and watched it at home and I can only come to the conclusion that Lana was taking The Matrix behind the woodshed and shooting it like Ole Yeller. It was hers and she couldnt let someone else do it so killed it herself.",1
4819,"It's a 2 and a half hour long trailer without anything that made the trilogy cult classics, didn't expect much, got even less, horrible movie that relies to much on meta and nostalgia, and it was not needed.",5
4820,Don't understand these reviews!! Great way to start another trilogy! Looking forward to the next one!! Love the way they did the reboot! Most reboot you can't normally keep some of the main characters!,9
4821,"When you do a 4th movie you either do it right or you do it wrong. There were a couple of unanswered questions at the end of Revolutions. They answered the questions and the answer makes sense. It could have been cheesy but it wasn't - if there is a cheesy or artificial aspect - it's from the Matrix, which is plausible. It was plausible and probable. Maybe even inevitable. Free your mind. Happy viewing!",9
4822,It's just an awful movie that really just doesn't make any sense the original trilogy ended perfectly and yet somehow Neo and Trinity are both still alive even though they died I guess they're clones I don't know it's not or wasting your time watching this terrible movie.,2
4823,"While I appreciate the idea of having a new matrix movie after 20 years or so, but it could have been done better than this. I really loved the appearance of some old characters, still the plot and how they connect it to the old matrix movies and why they were resurrected is not convincing enough. It almost feels like they are imitating the first matrix movie and gambling that people will drawl over it. I didn't like the new agent Smith sorry but not as good the old one. Overall it is not so bad but it is not good either.",6
4824,"To be honest, I expected more from the film! There are no questions about the actors' game, only at their expense, the film pulls at least some kind of assessment! The script and the direction are disgusting, what's their name, exiles or whatever they are, well, it's ala ""hackers"", then it was cool, but not now! Translated through a translator, if anything, from Russian ;)",3
4825,"Like many others writing reviews, I am a big fan of the original trilogy. I watched the films numerous times as a young teenager, and at the time really wanted a fourth film. As I got older though, I realised we didn't need a fourth and it just became a fond memory of my youth. So when I heard they were finally making another installment, I felt a little excited, but mostly nervous. Rightfully so.There are some interesting themes, such as what has the 'real world' been doing while Neo has been away? And do the oppressed know they're being oppressed? It also has some great action, as expected. Ironically, if I had seen this as a standalone action film and not known what had come before, I may have scored it higher.However the 4th film wants you to remember what came before and uses countless callbacks so you don't forget. It's a 2.5 hour film, and probably 0.5 hours too long because of this. All the good stuff is overshadowed by it being a caricature of what it once was. The dark grittiness has all but gone, the fantastic monologues and powerful characters from the original trilogy, reduced to gimmicks.If they wanted to milk this cow, they should have made a spin off film or series, but left the original trilogy alone.",6
4826,"This is by far the best movie in the franchise. Period. This is by far the most excellent way to end a story.I am amazed. This takes on the previous story and builds the next part of the concept of what the matrix represent and it is just amazing.Knowing what the matrix is based on is very important to understand it probably. The red pill and the matrix is a metaphor for dealing with the concept of being trans. Don't believe me? Look it up. To live the real life you must take the red pill, that was the color of the female hormone pills back in the old days. And that is the concept that the first three movies explored. When learning this I understood that this is a glimpse into what living as trans feels like, but that's another story.NOW we have the next part, because what comes after you take the red pill? What comes next? This is a movie that has gone beyond its viewers. Some people are not ready for this. I wouldn't have been some years ago, but thankfully I am and I know there are others who also understand. Warning: Slight theme spoiler; &gt;This is about the next step into enlightenment.&lt; Brilliant! Absolutely astounding and I am so happy to have experienced this masterpiece. Lana Wachowski deserves so much more than what these reviews. Y'all just don't get it.On top of this, the movies gave us a good blend of '00 and modern versions of futuristic styles as well. As a long time fan of the movies and the concept I couldn't be more happy with this movie.",9
4827,"Oh, the Analyst in the movie was right: what a mess.On the bright side, this 4th installment manages to cling to the initial feeling of an idea of a deep, subtle feeling (vicious cycle intended). The you know there's something but you can't put your finger on it thing (""You don't know what it is, but it's there"" from Matrix 1). This, they did quite well in the first half of the movie, and Keanu played it well again, reason why to me it's 6/10 (otherwise it's more of a 4-5/10).On the down side, mirroring Matrix 1 inevitable repeated the same mistakes (and made them worse). Just like in Matrix 1, the genuine intuition ends with its own mere ""predefinition"". Just like then, the authors didn't seem to know what to do with it, so it got explained by means of a repressive enemy and transposed into a bang-bang love-punk driven story with meaningless conclusions. Only worse, because after a decent first half with holding the bombastic, Matrix 2-3 like empty-shell action scenes at bay, which is after some carefully giving dialogues even more thought than in Matrix 1 and trying to keep away from clichés, the nakedness of the emperor strikes quite unpleasantly and a warmed-over slop is unleashed. Oh, you will have to endure human-bombs jumping through windows and a good amount of blatant attempts to create some sort of high-stakes in a noir atmosphere... with an empty romantic conclusion, used again as an acceptable goal in the absence of one to match (and truly follow) the premise. There are books out there (like Paradigm Shift, Stk Chan) that make better use of such a genuine premise.Overall, a watchable movie where newcomers may yawn in the end trying to compare it to other more recent action movies, while Matrix veterans may find themselves FFW-ing in a sort of acknowledgment that there's nothing more to it than the otherwise interesting/exciting idea back in 1999.",6
4828,"I was 16 years old when I saw the first Matrix and oh boy how I was trilled when I watched it, a complete home run it was. Then it was announced two sequels and I couldn't be more happy, the first one Reloaded kinda resembled the first one but with a deeper plot and the last one was the deal breaker for me in terms of letting this Saga just die and rest in peace. When I heard there would be another sequel I kinda wanted to believe it would be any good, after just watching it, I rate a 10 out of 10 in terms of special effect, scenarios, costume, CGI, but here's the thing with absolutely no plot it kinda goes downhill.They should had reviewed the plot better and fought to bring back Fishburne and Weaving, because in my opinion without them there is little sense on ressurecting this Saga.",5
4829,"Warner bros Please continue the story with a matrix 5.This movie was awesome! It's truly underrated. I think the logic went over a lot of people's heads, but i got to see how this movie interacts with the daily living in the meta world. I understand that they brought the fiction with the real and the real with fiction. Absolutely amazing! I give all the matrix movies 1 thousand stars. And to all the cast i give you all 2 thumbs up!",10
4830,"I liked keanus journey as neo, tortured by memories of the matrix, feeling like a prisoner, like nothing is real, trying to understand or find his place in the world...when you watched the original trilogy, as I feel like you WERE Neo... and I felt powerful.... It was fun to watch him freak out but when he remembers it feels so depressing...I hate seeing neo so powerless, in the trilogy's he felt like a god, here he's a disappointing version of Jesus with hardly any power...What happened to The neo who could control the sentinels, see the matrix through the real word?The whole movie I was waiting for him to reach for his potential... but he never did, somehow it's trinity who unlocks her full potential.... Why was neo in able to fly? It's just not explained as well....I always enjoy Keanu but this didn't feel like Neo... it was Walmart john wick...",6
4831,This movie was only made to push the transgender ideology in your face. The matrix 4 is a chore to watch it was super disappointing when it came to the story line and the fact it is pushing their own trans beliefs is appalling. The original trilogy is ruined thanks to this movie.,1
4832,"I don't know why the hate in some reviews and what did people expected but the movie is good and felt nostalgic, here's hoping we see more soon of neo and trinity in the matrix.",7
4833,"This movie was a real love story for me. Where I have not a problem identifying who is bad and who is a good personage. A clear message. And that is what I love. I have not waited for this sequel but in the end, I'm satisfied with the final result. Better than a Star Wars spin-off for sure.",10
4834,"Ignore the negative reviews. Its really sad that stereotypical movies like Marvel volume 100 will get rave reviews, and movies like this will bring a barrage of bad reviews.This film is a million times better than Matrix 2 and 3 which were pathetic cash-grabs. This movie actually pushes the story forward.I'm glad that all of you didn't get it because the movie-makers were making fun of people like you.",8
4835,Unnecessary. After watching it I don't feel like I took anything away from the experience. Seems like there were lots of ideas but the final act is a bit botched. And the end is just sort of thrown at you and you're like wha???,5
4836,"I was hopeful that this would revive the spirit of the 1999 film, but it only used dozens of clips from the original hit and mixed them with no organized plot to tie them together. Lets just half-recycle the original story and reunite Neo and Trinity. Glad I was already subscribed to HBO and didn't pay extra to be disappointed. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss did a good job considering the trap they were lured into.",3
4837,"Compared to the first movie this had not much new to offer.I found myself yawning two times during the movie and it was 5 pm in the afternoon.There was ""old"" material all over again and left an small opening for another followup movie, same as before. Sure it really had your mind bending trying to sort of the mess but other then that....""Matrix Resurrections"" is a movie sure to be watched but only once.",5
4838,"It's a pretty average film, keanu definitely doesn't ""still know Kung Fu"" I like the guy and he has his strengths and weaknesses in the film it could be choreography but the fighting just seems not at all like the originals, alot more talking then fighting, alot of telekinesis, alot of open palm moves and dare I say an overuse of bullet time. Worse characters, weird robots just just in general the designs look very early 2000's, I don't care what anyone says but Abdul mateen ii first Dr Manhattan and now Morpheus the guy can't act (and has a very odd shaped head to play bald characters). Such a shame that overall the film is a let down as it doesn't really explain much of what is new rather relying on rehashing and rebooting individual scenes from the originals. It tries to connect to modern day with the use of portals and not needing to ""run to a phone booth"" but it's just not good enough. The cgi is a but basic but honestly the film doesn't have a gripping enough story to really make you care. 5/10.",5
4839,"I don't understand all of the bad reviews. Will this movie cure the sick or feed the hungry, no, it's just a movie. I appreciate it for what it is and I thought it was amazing and very entertaining.",9
4840,"And that message is delivered to all the people giving this movie hate, to the franchise-owning companies and to the alt-right red pilled movement. To all the people thinking they own the matrix and use it for what it is not. It is one big middle finger to all fanboys wanting more of the same and to the big WB company for milking out the Matrix franchise. While at the same time giving the positive message that there are, among the sheeple, normal people who want to break free of this capitalistic culture where all big movies, games, or books are franchises of big companies. And the fun thing is that The Matrix is a franchise. This is almost like witnessing some kind of sabotage from the creator herself.The way the movie is so self-consciousness in the beginning and making it even more meta when the plot moves on after the first part, brings first into question our reality again as a viewer. Even when on first sight, it looks like the movie is going on and the real sequel story is unfolding itself, it becomes clear that the status quo that was reached after Matrix Revolutions is also used as a metaphor for our current real-life world. Making even the ""official"" lore of the matrix meta-criticism. People hate that Niobe is played by Jada Pinket Smith with a lot of make-up to make her look older, but it is part of that point. All the characters, of the previous movies which became old in this one, are old for that reason.The new characters, Agent Smith and Morpheus are totally different from their old counterparts, and are thus deliberately clashing with the old characters on purpose. What a bold move to criticize and troll the fanboys by having some scenes with those characters, while combining it with clips of the old movie. It cannot be more clear that Lana just did not even try to meet, but even criticizing, the expectations of every fanboy wanting more of the same.The only downside of the movie is that it is impossible to meet the quality set by the 1999 original movie. That rules set by the old movies needed to be broken, since phone and internet technology has moved on. This created unclear new rules, and makes it sometimes unclear what is happening on screen. It makes it all feel like there are plot holes in the movie. But honestly, at this point, the technical details of the matrix lore and the story are becoming unimportant, since this movie is revolting against its own.The message of this movie is as Lana said in 2016 about love, a positive message that we can think for ourselves and a middle finger to big companies and fanboys who wanted to see another kind of Matrix 4.Wachowski showed she had the gut to make her own movie and refused to play by their rules. We need to applaud this.",7
4841,"The Matrix Resurrection is a little different from the first three movies. The Matrix Resurrection does not give details by philosophizing, having long conversations or making aphorisms. It gives the details in a simple way. Therefore, it may not have met the expectations, but this does not make the movie bad.",10
4842,"Don't understand all the negative reviews, really good film. Watched with an open mind not expecting it to be the same as previous films, didn't expect much after reading the bad reviews and was pleasantly surprised.",9
4843,The Matrix (1999) was perfect and the sequences were good but Matrix Resurrections should not exist.1) Why they needed to search for neo if the purpose (and his own sacrifice) were fufilled. The humans lived well in a new city. Even the leader Niobe did not want that. Movie existence is weak.2) Iconic caractheres were brought back without strong explanations and their behavior was transformed badly.3) Very lazy actions scenes and poor story5) Why Trinity must be an chosen one as well ?she was very bad ass already.,4
4844,"The Matrix original trilogy is probably my favourite and definitely most watched trilogy or even standalone series of all time. I was quite excited about this movie and went in hopeful. At best it adds to the already amazing and complex story, at worst, it adds nothing and I simply don't watch it again.The story was interesting, it was a smart way to bring back characters we've lost, but it did nothing for the new characters.This was a movie about nostalgia and nothing else landed quite as well as the first movie.Character development was non existant. Smith was non threatening. The anomaly even less-so. The acting was bad, we didnt need an aged Naobi still played by Jada. And Keanu didn't quite fall back into the role. Carrie played Trinity exceptionally well.This movie is absolutely worth watching. But go in expecting to love the nostalgia, and the incredible storytelling... and not much else.",7
4845,"Felt like watching john wick in a talkshow... As commented elsewhere: let the past be the past, except for bad boys they rock 😂. On top of that i ate too much candy and felt sick afterwards...",5
4846,"People are going to hate this movie, but they are going to hate it for the wrong reasons. My biggest dissappointment was that in the first fklm, characters i liked and whom were fleshed out, were killed whole sale, but this movie where the characters have no depth, they all survived. More time developing relationships and less screen time showing long shots and scenes would have benefited all the mouth breathers who focus solely the wtf language and age of the actors.It was 1999 when the first came out. After ruminating some on this movie. I bumped from a six to a seven.This is exactly what i wanted. It wasnt a reboot, it wasnt a sappy love story, it wasnt a gun show with fantastic flips and kicks, it was a spectacle of pure matrix fun.If you didnt enjoy this, you should watch animatrix.Merry christmas you filthy animals.",7
4847,"Interesting plot with simple enough motivation and explanation: they need to be together to be extraordinary and when they're almost together they generate great amounts of power.Free will drove the first series; love, connection, passion drive this one.There are some sloppy parts but overall this is a great addition to a Sci Fi franchise.",9
4848,The moment I saw Priyanka Chopra in the promos it was quite clear they made many such bad decisions and watching the movie only confirmed it. The story is too forced and a complete mess.,4
4849,"I loved the film as it stands,but there is room to improve, for instance it felt like it would have benefited from being longer or having its plot split between more than one film, a lot of the characters that are returning returned well, and the characters that were newly introduced felt like they fit, however its difficult to invest in new characters we don't have enough information on yet which made them feel out of place.That all being said, The reason I'm even making a review is because I see a lot of people making negative reviews feeling like Laurence Fishburne is being replaced in this film as Morpheus, but I don't think that's the intention, and even if it is, it makes more sense given the introduction of this NEW CHARACTER, the ""Morpheus"" in this new film isn't Morpheus at all, its a digital lifeform made by Neo based on Morpheus and Agent smith, if it looked like Fishburne it wouldn't really make sense would it? I personally loved this idea, it is a good callback to the character especially when you consider its Neo's way of clinging onto something familiar in his current environment, he's convinced he's insane and anxious as hell about his fake career making something nostalgic is his brains defense mechanism and a callback to the previous films in itself.In my opinion the film deserves a 7+ with me landing on 8 due to my personal enjoyment of the experience I wanted to touch on things here because people seem to have some misconceptions about some decisions in the film and it feels like we watched different movies the reviews vary so much.",8
4850,"""Art should mirror the current society"" and this one does a damn well job at this. All you have to do is replace the NEW matrix with the rise of internet/social media and this movie blossoms if you are watching it from that perspective. Is it a perfect movie ? Ofc not ! Plenty of things they could have done better but overall is good.From what i've seen people went to see only another ""bullet time"" effect and the irony is that they knew this will be the case.So unless you are in it for the story and have some social and self awareness this will not hit you for now.The voice of the new matrix/internet/social media as a conclusion at the end : ""they dont want this sentimentality, they dont want freedom or empowerement, they want to be controlled...the confort of certanity and that means you 2 back in your pods , unconsciouss and alone...just like them"".""we used to have style , we used to have conversations...""Those 2 characters indeed have a ""another chance"" of changing something IF is not to late and this real ""matrix"" we live in already won.",8
4851,"I was super excited when I heard a new Matrix was coming, and man, was I disappointed when I finally saw it. If I factored in my anger at just how incredibly bad it is, I'd lower my score to a 2, but in an effort to be 'fair', I'm giving it a 4.For the first half hour, it seems to have some potential, like maybe there's going to be a new profound spin on the original story, but all such hopes quickly shatter as you find yourself watching a poorly made remake with lesser acting, lesser action, a lesser script and a plot that apes the first. In fact, not only does it ape the first movie, it KEEPS flashing back to the far superior first outing as scenes from this one ape the scenes from that one. So in effect, you're watching a poor remake whole being shown the superior movie that it's remaking, step by step, move by move, sequence by sequence. The only difference is that rather than Neo flying at the end, Trinity learns it first this time, because, wow - how original. This must be what fans have waited twenty years for! The same movie, made worse, and with Trinity flying first and then Neo catching up! It has the audacity to end as though it expects to have sequels of its own, and if there's any hope to the universe, those plans should be flattened by what will surely be an incredibly bad reception.It's terrible. Even the action sequences are terrible, with Keanu looking stiff in all his movements.Overall, it feels like the creators of this movie are trolling the fan base on the worst possible way, by constantly reminding them of the better movie while shoving this banal tripe down their throats.This did not need to be made.",4
4852,"Where do i start...original trilogy totally destroyed. Everything neo did we discover was for nothing. Like a week after he died the machines whent into civil war and the architect, oracle and old matrix down the literal pod drain.neo is not the one/is sexually impotent: what better than a tasteless joke about a men that takes daily blue pills and his co-ck feels like made of silly putty. Not to mention he lost all his ""the one"" abilities.new morpheus is awful: he is an AI made by neo, from his memories of morpheus + smith code? Is a digital pi-mp. That likes to sell red pills on dark corners of the matrix.new smith is total garbage: the guy that makes smith feels like a 5 years old kid that tries to impersonate stallone in rocky. When he remembers he is smith and screams ""MRS ANDERSON"" i loled so hard i almost pass out. Not to mention it show me this is a intended garbage movie.sati is not the new oracle. She cannot see the future nor understand stu-pidity aka human stuff. Yet she likes to spend time over a magical well filled with magical water that shows what the plot needs to be showing the viewer. So when she wants she can see the future and when the plot demands it, she is hopeless.pet machines: what happens when you mix pokemon and transformers? You get ""sentients"" the robots on IO the new city where humans and robots alike live on peace. And make great toys to be sold.old niobe: a total lesbian b!tch that loves to scissor with old character from the sequels that i dont even care to remember how its the name. Awful makeup that looked like a 5 USD halloween costume they got in a rush because they forgot she was on the movie. She looks more like an old Jack Sparrow than johnny deep currently.the analist: seriously the machines put in charge of the WHOLE matrix a complete mo-ron, that his 60 years old matrix feels apart in 10 seconds after neo and trinity leaves it? So original architect and oracle managed to keep the matrix functional for 600+ years. Machine civil war rages, new machines take over and they replace the 2 programs that keep the matrix ticking... by a new mo-ron that believes that torturing all the humans gets him more extra energy for the power plant. He acts as a therapist and forgets that humans constantly tortured by having a sh!tty life will commit suicide... not to mention the machines cry cause there are too much programs/processing power beeing use VS lack of humans powering them... yea this analist is a genius...the merovingian totally ruined. Hidden on the new matrix dressed up as if the train man had taken a 60 years old nap on a garbage can... screaming at the top of his lungs cr@p like ""ow this is so un-original"" or ""prepare for countless spin off series"" yea lana please keep telling us what you promised to WB while you planned making the worst movie in the latest 30 years that hollywood has proudly produced.new IO city seems to be out of a fantasy film: hidden by holograms (600+ years in the future machines that have godlike technology cannot detect holograms the size of a human ship...) is complete garbage. The ceiling is a mesh of garbage that generates vapor clouds so it can rain (inside a gigantic crater hole like lovely to get rain and drown on the water or let it sink at the bottom and get rotten water) the city has everything you might want. Elevators, terrain fields to grow strawberries, oranges and random grass. Luxurious apartments on random hill sides. Are we sure zion/IO is not a secondary matrix???lana's revenge: this is intentionally bad. Bad action bad fight sequenses bad special effects. Vomiting story. Tro-lling WB execs that forced this movie to be done. Probably she knows this is the last one she will ever make thats why trash-ed it.trinity is the new ""one"" but now are two ""ones"" : neo cannot fly, cannot do nothing more than a stu-pid jedi force push/explosion that trinity can do when touching neo. At the end she can fly and he still cant. She is the new ""architect"" that with the snap of a finger she can kill or chop into pieces the analist and reform it at will. Of course at the end neo can fly near by trinity. But the main ""one"" now is trinity. Neo is a moron. Trinity is smart.new characters are awful: all forgettable. Bugs is the most acceptable out of all of them. The crazy lesbian that goes to neo's room, opens the door and starts to bark at neo going ""yea i am not doing this (when they go to disconnect trinity) for you, i will do this for trinity. I am sure she was the one not you all along"" this seems lana on a bad day barking at keanu since neo acts like an old man, emotionless puts his head down and takes it like a metal rod inserted into his an-us. Quite violently.Overall, if you wanna hate this movie and the original trilogy please watch it. As a serious movie crashes and burns and as a parody seems to be the worst SNL episode of all times. Past present and future. You lol hard almost pass out asking out loud ""do they really did this? We are observing how the IP gets demolished in real time in front of our eyes"" watch only if you wanna get matrix 4 PTSD.",1
4853,"I have watched it with very low expectations, thinking it was going to be a joke on the trilogy from the trailer and comments I heard from friends, but it's so good to have your expectations exceeded.Having watched the original 22 years ago (multiple) times in the cinema, when I was still a teenager, this is exactly what I needed to watch now. The Matrix has been an Oracle in my life, and this was not only a good reminder, but it developed the story in what I needed to hear.I am not sure Lana Wachowski meant it, but there's lots of pandemic references, at least the ""lockdown"" must be intentional. The story talks about this moment of reawakening, which we all need, or think we need, until whatever comes next. Some.really funny quotes, with an awful lot of truth: ""The sheeple aren't going anywhere."". So truth especially coming out of the architect.It is harder to get out of the cave after you're older, made things comfortable and nice and get attached.I liked the colours as well, less green and more rainbow. Good taste.Loved to see the aged characters. Merovingean, so funny. Good touch of humour. It reminded me a bit of Trainspotting 2.What else do you want from a sequel? It's hard to beat the first one, but was a fair job at following it up. I would even say I probably liked this more than Reloaded, the second one.",9
4854,"After watching an interview of Keanu with Stephen Colbert we decided that Matrix Resurrections was a ""must see"" movie.Now that we have seen it, we kinda wished we hadn't. The start was slow and felt almost like a parody. Once the action got going, there were too many montages to fast forward the storyline.Definitely glad we saw it on a small screen. Not enough in it for us to have shelled out for a theatre viewing.",6
4855,"Yeah it's alright, it's not better then the original. It does do some interesting things with the matrix formula, but that's only in the first 30-40 minutes, after that it's just like the other matrix movies. This one is definitely the most romantic movie, with most off the story revolving around neo and trinity. It is also probably the most violent of the four, but it's not really that much. If this movie was streaming, you could probably just watch the beginning which is actually interesting, but then skip to the last 20 minutes to see how it ends.",3
4856,"What a horrible film. To paraphrase Mel Brooks at the end of ""Spaceballs"", all it is is ""Matrix IV: The Search for More Money"". No plot. No acting. No direction. No mystery. No movie.",2
4857,"It was a fun ride that I suggest to anyone who enjoyed the trilogy. It was not the worst of the now four movies. I have read interviews and understand the original three were a trans allegory. Ergo, the forth movie is a wonderful love letter to the fans.",8
4858,"I watched no trailers, and my expectations were low. In the end, my son and I enjoyed it. I've always been a fan of the first MATRIX. When I was in the Air-Force (2001), my brother gave me the dvd movie for Christmas. Watching Matrix Resurrection, I had a blast!",9
4859,"Great story, great production, great effects. It is very difficult after so many years to continue the story with the same characters and turn out so good. To all the haters, it's science fiction, I don't know what you expected.",10
4860,You know the characters and the essence of the story. So why watch it? There are more than a few twists and surprises. Plus it offers a refreshing reminder that we are all in this together and the only way out is to remember this. The music score is moving and there are a few great laughs. Overall an experience that left me feeling hopeful.,8
4861,"The Matrix franchise being one of my top favourites as well as one of most cherished, I was shocked to find how boring I found the 4th one.Literally everything about this movie seemed unconvincing and uninspiring to say the least.I guess the only redeeming factor was the visuals, which kept the movie at least somewhat fun and why I still gave this a 6, but I could not buy into the story, dialogues boring, and I did not really get the message of this movie not because I couldn't understand it but there weren't much there to begin with. Nothing much resonated except the same old, same old, except with much less charm and impact. In fact, I rewatched Matrix 1 a month ago and it still gave me chills down my cords, almost unplugged me from the matrix. Still had me tear up. Matrix 4? Barely anything. I was just sitting there, being slightly amused at times, being slightly moved at other times, and then the rest, just killing time mostly. Yeah that's what this felt like. One of those movies to kill time, except it is skinned with SOME Matrix characters.What happened? Seriously, what the hell happened?I memba when Matrix was actually FANTASTIC, not a mediocre action flick.See my face? See my expression?This is the face you make when you catch your parents cheating.PURE DISAPPOINTMENT.",6
4862,"I am going to write about this film from my perspective of view point, the matrix resurrection is to me a film of complete love and is about finding the one you believe in. Because in the Matrix Revolution we saw neo died and his body was taken by machine and no one assumed what happened to Trinity. The Matrix Resurrection shows that there is in actually no getting out of the system because the system imprint new system according to your believe and thought na put you back on with another life and a name back into the system. Therefore when you get resurrected your true memory of past life becomes a dream in your next life and presented in way that it's all just a dream but yet actually those are a true memory from any of your past lives.There is also a story remaining in Zion that how things changed after the war and how they are holding up; based on their beliefs.In the end, as a viewer it's might seem in a way that it's the same story told in a new way but the underlying fact remains a new like; are you still in a dream or in a reality or what was in your past life or are you still in a loop or not.On filmmaking view as a filmmaker, they really uses state of the art vfx using the old concept with some new ideology of thinking and that was awesome kind a way like how things are now and where technology is heading with filmmaking.As a film reviewers view point, the matrix book just added something new and gotten bigger and since we all have our own thoughts and views that how it should be that remains with each one of us, the story was about this time finding your true love and what you believing in like that. Because it's story about Neo finding himself after death and Trinity as well finding herself and becoming as The One. There is also a philosophy in Zen Buddhism about human and that we saw - not going to reveal; I will say to you to find it by yourself.However I am not pleased with the film releasing procedures; the film should not be released in web platforms at least for 2 months; they could have follow the procedures of Disney; how they really doing. Two great film got released in web early in torrent sites like Dune and now the Matrix Resurrection. It's a future question, where it's heading.In the very end, I read all reviews and surprised- how people are not seeing everything - one thing we should remember; it's easy to comment but difficult to make it happen through filmmaking. Please forgive since yet this is all my view point and review.",8
4863,"I'm more concerned with the negative reviews about this movie than the movie itself. The Matrix franchise as a whole, has been a gift to All of us in terms of sci-fi action fantasy with the message of love, unimaginable loyalties, and all beings living together as one, while being completely separated from a greedy, copycat, money-hungry, agenda-driven society. There were aspects that felt annoying, so of course I don't predict many 10s...but it's at a 5.9 out of 10 as I am writing. I'd give it a 7.8, so I rounded up.Also... my wife and I are huge Matrix fans and we decided to watch all 3 the weekend before seeing part 4. This advantageously opened a whole new perspective for us mutually. Our minds, Our growth, &amp; Our experiences are different and deeper(as Earthlings) than they were 20yrs ago when this franchise first shook the world.My wife &amp; I feel more powerful as one than two individuals.Please see it again... maybe my rating is bias towards my feelings of what is missing in my world.",8
4864,"My 15 year old daughter had never seen the Matrix movies. I loved them; Revolutions had some difficult bits, but otherwise loved them. So my wife and I decided to watch them with her for Christmas, then go and see the new one in the theaters. 15 minutes in, I realized I let Hollywood get me again. What. A. Complete. Waste. Of. Time. And. Money.Bad action, terrible characters, and worst of all: NO PLOT! I'm sorry, there wasn't. None. A series of disjointed scenes, unrelated topics, random events, and ZERO coherence. Brief example: Blue haired twenty-something ""freedom fighter"" commands a ship after somehow being freed from the Matrix after seeing Neo hovering one day. How did she get out? Who freed her? How does she very quickly command a ship and crew of her own? Why is she looking for Neo? Simple questions, no answers. The entire movie is filled with this; scenes and characters are shown with ZERO explanation as to how they came about. Niobi being in charge of another human city where they co-habit with machine sentients. How? When? Why? Never explained. Machine sentients are part of the crew. How did they join? How did humans and machines even start talking, let alone decide to work together? This movie doesn't know and neither will you. After their initial introduction, you'll never see them again.The Matrix trilogy is REKNOWNED for its incredible action scenes: my daughter would literally squeal in excitement during the highway chase scene in Reloaded, among others. This movie....if I had to guess without knowing I would assume they got someone's cousin who saw a few B-action movies and thought ""I could direct some awesome scenes if I could just get the chance!!"" Characters literally unload fully automatic weapons point-blank in front of people without hitting anyone, with no bullet-time dodging taking place. In the other movies you could mostly believe the characters could super-hacker dodge their way around combat and not get hit. Here, people stand on top of desks or hop sideways onto a wall and bullets just miss them. Guns don't work that way. A sideways person on a wall is still a giant person-sized target 10 feet away, just sideways. Easy to shoot with 30 rounds of 5.56 traveling anywhere between 2800 to 3300 feet-per-second. No one dies. Ever. 50 police just shooting all the time. Lol, literally had a scene--Police ""Freeze! Don't move!!"" and they immediately open fire with fully automatic weapons. No pause. No reactive fire. Just an IMMEDIATE fusillade of gunfire. Why bother saying anything? I'm guessing all the police in this movie are just bot programs with how they act. They never second guess orders, such as ""Hey Bennie?"" ""Yeah Frank?"" ""Why are all us cops and SWAT guys, and FBI, and everyone just standing here in this coffee shop with this nerdy guy just waiting?"" ""I don't know Frank, just be quiet and look menacing."" WTH???And the Merovingian and his Exiles....just....what were they thinking???? I won't spoil that particular cinematic-and-story gem.I could write a critical thesis on how bad this movie was, story-wise, from beginning to end, but that would take too long. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Keanu, Carrie, I'm sorry, I don't blame you. Other actors/actresses, I don't blame you really either. It is a terrible story. This movie didn't Resurrect the Matrix, it drove a SJW stake through its heart. Shame....",1
4865,"Overall, it felt too ""meta"" and I would've appreciated a continuation of the Matrix World and not a continuation inspired by the Matrix. In other words, this is not a Matrix movie and has none of the characteristics of one.What I liked:the cinematography-the sets-most of the FX-Keanu and Carrie Anne-blue haired girl was fun-seeing Noabie was cool although her actions in the film felt out of character. Granted, 60 years passed so I get it.What I didn't like:-the action was choppy, claustrophobic, and short.-Smith. Don't bring him back and not bring back Hugo. Just make a new antagonist.-Neil Patrick Smith as the new Architect. Didn't come off smart or intimidating. Just felt like a home maker.-Morpheus had no point being here. Just make a new character that is black.-the broll of the original Matrix cut into this film-all the references to the first Matrix like the dojo scene and the ""wake up"" end title song. They played a cover. Wow.",5
4866,"Just meh.......... is better as a tv show far apart from the classic first movie and more of a cheesy copy really, watch on netflix in a few weeks it wont be to long to wait for it be out.",1
4867,"I just didn't thought I'm watching The Matrix because of the color theme, I miss the greenish color theme which I couldn't see and feel it like the previous episodes.",7
4868,"I watched the first and second matrix movie yesterday and the other two movies today. For people who had been waiting for the movie would have had more hopes. The 1st nd 2nd movie may be my favorite. And 3rd was a master piece. The matrix resurrection could have been a little more than Neo and Trinity. I loved the couple so much. A long waited love is a pure bliss. Machine and human living peacefully is surely a thing. Niobe, bugs and sati were the other important characters and Smith is back as usual.",7
4869,"I, for the life of me, cannot understand why this movie is rated so low on here, unless most of the voters are under 36 yrs old, because having grown up watching the Matrix original movies as a teenager the Matrix Resurrections delivered on all points for me.I loved the flashbacks and the symbolic hints to the trilogy throughout the movie. I loved to see the same characters with familiar energy, yet made up to date. I loved the hip bordering on tacky outfits that were modern yet still completely true to the first three movies.I also truly appreciated the storyline. Which I won't go into because really, go see it for yourself.And yes, naturally there was a big pompous amount of action in it as well, as is completely on brand for any Matrix movie!Furthermore, the cultural references and jokes, especially by the Merovingian, are really hilarious, albeit perhaps only funny if you've actually consciously lived through the 90's and 00's because growing up in a time without constant online and digital interaction most of us still have some healthy suspicion towards how far the internet and devices have altered our way of thinking, interacting and being.For me it gave me exactly what I hoped for: enough nostalgia for times long gone mixed with a sense of humor that can only develop through lived experiences. I am craving for more honestly. So fingers crossed for another trilogy.",10
4870,"Matrix 1 was a brain-bending mind-melting epic. Matrix 2 explored this established universe deeper with more rules, programs, and mythos. Matrix 3 had the feeling of a 'last stand!' 'final fight!' type atmosphere to it which resolved the conflict. It's understandable that fans coming into Matrix 4 would expect either A) something NEW to absolutely blow their mind, B) a deeper examination of the Matrix/machine world or C) a new 'humanity's last hope!' type of a fight.Instead, what you have to understand The Matrix Resurrections is at heart... is a good old fashioned, classic tragic love story. That's what it is. It plays more like an extended-length episode of Black Mirror about tragic romance, than the mind-melding sci-fi action romp that people may have come to expect. And that's okay.Act 3 of The Matrix Revolutions was basically a sad, somber 'Neo and Trinity go on a hopeless, suicide mission to the machine city knowing they probably won't be coming back. And SPOILERS by the end, fans saw that they most certainly didn't. The Matrix 4 serves as a coda specifically to this sad, somber act 3. It asks the question ""What if Neo and Trinity didn't die? What if the machines saw it beneficial to resuscitate them and hook them back into the Matrix? What might that look like?""Ultimately, when you press Play to watch, go into it expectating just that - a love story that transcends time, reality, and consciousness itself. Everything else is a bonus.Sure, there are things that as a Matrix fan I was annoyed by - lack of Fishbourne and Hugo Weaving, being shot on video vs Super 35mm, or the action choreography a step behind the prior films. Some of the acting is dry and wooden (including Reeves). What ultimately falls short is the execution of the movie itself. The story wasn't perfect, but it's absolutely acceptable as a continuation of the already-established universe.I've read some reviews that said the action scenes are lacking - I would agree with this somewhat. There certainly isn't anything 'new' that's added (machine gun fights, kung fu, car chases, rooftop fights, etc), but this is still 100% an action movie first and foremost, so don't let that put you off. Glad I saw it.",7
4871,"Walked in the theater quite sceptic and defensive after reading the other reviews on imdb but was frankly quite surprised at how they revived (literally and figuratively) the characters and tied the old story to this sequel. Although lacking some action awe, this movie goes deeper and opens the way for durable peace between men and machine.",9
4872,"The Matrix 4...... It was bad.... I mean REALLY bad. The laziest fight choreography I have ever seen. Matrix 3....was hot garbage, but compared to part 4? It is a gods-be-damned masterpiece!!!It was as bad as the new Wheel-of-time TV show. .... that show, leaves the exact seem taste in my mouth....as I have after seeing the Matrix 4Like a parody, with the budget, directing and writing of a porn.The acting was pretty terrible too, only the actors from ""Sense 8"" pulled their weight. Keanu Reeves also did an OK job, but overall it seemed like it was something from a Hallmark holiday movie or TV show from the CW.What a joke.",5
4873,"After more than almost 19 years since his last film, we have the Matrix Resurrections, the fourth installment in the saga of science fiction / cyberpunk films, where we will once again see the original protagonists, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, in their roles. Iconic Neo and Trinity, who seem to have an everyday life completely forgetting their past; but now, a new group of rebels and a new Morpheus, will fight to free them from the Matrix.The first tape offered us a story with some parallels of some religious, philosophical and ideological concepts, in addition to being a before and after in the visual effects of the time, it won 4 Oscars and became a cult film, logically This film no longer gives any surprise nor does it stand out, except for some special effects, I think Matrix 4 is more for the fans who wanted to see what happened with ""Zion"" or Laurence Fishburne after the third film and see why our protagonists were alive when the trailer for this fourth movie came out.Matrix Resurrections begins by repeating a scene from the first movie then continues in a somewhat entangled way with Neo who is a famous video game developer, at the same time we see some flashbacks from the previous tapes while Neo returns to doubt more and more reality in the film. That he is, because of this he sees a therapist who prescribed medicine (the blue pill) to control his strange ""visions"", however the tape improves when they manage to release him by taking a good rhythm to see what has happened outside.Since the first movie we have never known in what year they are really out of the Matrix but we can always get an idea by images that appear briefly as the year of manufacture of their transports, now it is seen that they are later than and that unfortunately they have 60 years have passed since Neo made the truce with the machines and he seemed to have died, by the way, if it seems strange to them that now some machines help humanity, it has to do with the ""Animatrix"" shorts (must-see).On the other hand as a fan I am glad to see several characters again and know what happened to them as ""Sati"" or the Merovingian (the French) king of the ""underworld"" in the matrix, that ancient and powerful program that was the leader of the exiled shows, today dressing as a tramp losing their influence, prestige and sanity, hating Neo for causing the next Matrix update or Jada Pinkett Smith as Niobe highlighting the makeup effects with her characterization as an old woman.The performances in the film are good to dry, the ones that stand out slightly are Yahya Abdul-Mateen II along with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss showing that they still have chemistry, however, I think the biggest problem that the film has is that does not offer a new villain or difficult enough to defeat for our protagonists, Smith although at the time he was, now he is no longer transcendent beyond the fact that he survives everything like a cockroach and the Analyst who replaces the Architect it is almost a mere joke.Rating: 7.5.",7
4874,Why did this movie have to be made? Watching this movie was like riding an unbridled horse into a hurricane during a nuclear holocaust. What a dumpster fire. I gave it 2/10 one for being in color and one for being in English. Enough with the cash grab continuations of beloved trilogies. You're not satisfying anyone.,2
4875,"I was so hyped up to see this,but it was just good to see the characters back.nothing like a sort of bullet time.nothing to impress.just a ordinary movie.",7
4876,Old school matrix plus newer Wachowski style. Love so much about this movie. It's also getting better with every rewatch. Holes in the plot I thought were there seem to make sense and I just can't get enough of it.,9
4877,Hmmmm..... why why why so confulated a story and how much mish mash of visual present/historical flashbacks are necessary to simply convince the viewer to take either a blue or red pill??? Got through 50mins then walked away and returned to normality.... or did I !!!!!!!!!... Will never know nor care. Come on.... hoped for more but got less.,4
4878,"Its unfortunate that the direction, cinematography, production decisions, plot decisions and the lack of nuance at times in making political critiques, fails a great concept.Whilst the original films used colour pallets effectively with their political commentary, this new film fails to support its new and much brighter saturated toning and missed an opportunity to make commentary on more modern current forms control.To many times does it shove its self awarness in your face and treats the audience as if they lack the understanding that theres a world in a world repeating itself.The pacing is simply off, plot is poorly communicated and the actions scenes lack polish and are offensive to Keanu who is extremely talented in this area.One part that frustrated me specifically was the change in behaviour of characters when the matrix. Orginally they appeared not to tire and not to sweat or overly panic as they were aware these were constructs of the matrix. This made them more humanised when in the real world. Now they appear exactly the same in or out and this takes away from remembering they are just in a computer. It also took a more subtle way communicating the self awareness of the characters.All this adds up to a disappointing film which for some may only watch to the end to see where the mess ends but they will be wishing for it finish for a long time .",3
4879,"I feel like I must be one of the only people who actually really enjoyed this, but I did! I'm surprised that I had such a good time watching it.Its more campy and self-aware than the original trilogy, it's almost more along the lines of Being John Malkovich or Adaptation, which kind of worked for me. It really toed the very tricky tightrope of panache and depth and probably leaned a little bit too far in one direction.No, its not slick or cool or cutting edge like the original. There's not the same minimal 90s visuals or the fight scenes that defy physics. No, the world of The Matrix doesn't feel as richly detailed and boundless anymore. There's not the same level of mythology and world building as in the original trilogy. I also didn't feel an impending sense of doom or fear.BUT!! I saw some new ideas and world elements be introduced that really excited me and I want to see more of. There was less at stake in this film but I really think in the future there's some really rich stories to be told with these new little idea.Overall I was really impressed that Lana was able to introduce some fresher stuff beyond the original conceit of the series. I really really hope there's more, but it looks like it hasn't been well received so we'll see. Imo for the next films to work, I think we probably don't need to see any more of the Neo and Trinity thing. I'm glad that it picked up where we left off in the last film but we probably don't need to see anymore of their love story. I hope that we can hopefully leave that behind and move on to the really juicy stuff!",7
4880,"I was enjoying every moment and found myself laughing out loud frequently. I see this movie as a magnificent celebration of self-irony and as a remake easy to forgive. Still, I can't imagine grasping the idea if I hadn't seen at least the first Matrix. Recommended for fans who don't take the Matrix universe too seriously.",9
4881,"Outside of the flawed notion of choice, the philosophical and psychological concepts that were explored were done well. And taking into account the new philosophies regarding technology (see rebrand to Meta), are we really that far away from the possibility of confusing a false existence with what we inherently feel is real (though still possibly false)? Story was good, fight sequences were appropriate in duration.",8
4882,"OK ok, they even mention it themselves (sort of) in the movie, can you reinvent bullettime? That feeling we all had when we saw that jaw dropping first scene of the very first ""The Matrix"".No, you can't. Obviously making two terrible follow up movies does not help.This albeit not amazing and ground breaking, is better than 5 stars, this reflects the disappointment of fans, who wish for another masterpiece, but got this instead.Its decent, not terrible.I went into the movie thinking it would suck, but it didn't really, it was half decent. So 7 it is, solid entertainment, not amazing, and does not totally suck either.",7
4883,"Beginning 1/10i just did not understand what was going on there, and this cuts are so annoyingMid Film 5/10Okay its a fact, the special effects are so nice, makes fun to watchEnd 2/10 i mean why tf he can not fly but she can aaaaaa!!I would let the trilogy end after film 3, it makes no sense that he revived them.But the title is ""Matrix"", so yeah it is a 6/10 film.",6
4884,"It's good to see the characters we miss so much. Good action scenes and special effects as always. But the plot is confusing difficult to understand. And the fight scenes are with the camera very closely, they are hardly understood and they are not like in the original film even though we have the same director. I hope that if they make a sequel it will be better.",8
4885,"The fourth movie is terribly bad from the cinematographic point of view and from the plot as well. Once again the cinema in the West has lent itself to the conformity of the new generations to present something mediocre seeking acceptance. Too bad the Matrix hasn't escaped from that. The script is totally mediocre and the actor cast as the antagonist is incredibly lousy. I saw it 1 time and I will not do it again and think that Matrix 1,2 and 3 I saw them on average about 5 times in the cinema. The other thing that was essential to happen is that a mythical action scene was generated, but in this release I did not perceive anything to remember, or comment or refer, not even a little, it was incredible how empty it is. How things get destroyed, right?",1
4886,"Me and my friends totally liked it.Got some new elements too.I admit the very first part is the best ( at least for me), but the entire franchise is good.We must not forget what effort is behind the movie, it's not easy to create or recreat something good!Many thanks for the creators, enjoyed it!",7
4887,"I'm surprised by the poor reviews. This movie is a completely fresh and valuable entry into the Matrix universe, which is a tremendous achievement from a film-making perspective. I've watched it 3 times so far and feel like watching it again.The movie has tons of motifs throughout. Parts of them are very obvious, others more subtle. But each one I've spotted so far reoccurs at least 3-4 times. And they all point to very valuable observations or lessons about the world we currently live in.I suspect that people who spot the most obvious ones, but not the motifs themselves, conclude that the movie is shallow, empty of real substance.If you've loved the Matrix for more than the action, if you've enjoyed it for the observations, interesting quotes and discussions, and the philosophy behind it, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy this one.",10
4888,"Like many, I ventured out to watch a eagerly anticipated follow up to the previous trilogy, especially interested on how the story could be continued.The movie storyline actually (for me) starts really well and the whole premise of Neo being stuck back in the matrix, managed by the ""therapist"" and using his previous memories to generate a computer game, thus playing on his psych which in turn, is manged by the iconic blue bills works very well, Added to this is ""Trinity's"" presence and the whole early encounters (and knowing looks between them) is a real strong suit to the movie. This whole plot knits in to the previous very real and a good bit of creative writing.The movie then just let's itself down, basically, re-hashing the previous first movie including many of the set pieces, there's way to many cut scenes from the previous movies added in too which ruins the whole premise of the computer game (i.e. These should have been digitised to show the link from the game to the actual events). It feels cheap tricks and lack of imagination. Surely the training scene could of least had a new backdrop?Added to this is weak new characters, all of which lack gravitas and class, especially the new architect who is more Joe 90 than a villain in the making. The movie was always going to struggle with a re-hash of Agent Smith with the absence of Hugo Weaving, along with the new storyline of Morpheus which again, lacks purpose and fades away as the movie progresses.A massive let down is also the re-appearance of the Frenchman, a icon and stylish character from the previous.....the whole idea of the ""programs"" being left to rot by the matrix is a good idea and could of really driven a strong side story, but instead, we are treated to a utterly bizarre appearance of the character; almost because the writers felt he should appear but had no idea how, so just chucked him in to a scene. A complete waste.The plot holes then soon to appear all over the place and especially since the ""matrix"" itself had been re-programmed after the third storyline by the machines, but they some how managed to leave Agent Smith around.....do they not have any anti-virus software installed?! :-) This went without adequate explanation and the character lacks all form of menace and even purpose. Again, the writers must of just felt the need to write him in without good reason or story. Another opportunity missed.After thus insert set piece actions, more helicopters, bullet time, lots of SWAT who cannot aim, skyscrapers and the normal re-hash stuff......if anyone can explain where the other two helicopters went I'd appreciate it by the way! (the scene on the top of the skyscraper, cornered by 3 helicopters etc...)The movie had lots of potential and the writers/Directors went to great lengths to knit the story from the previous, as I've said, I felt that worked well. It then falls victim (in a new Star Wars way) to have to just re-do set pieces and forget about any story telling, there was so much of a possibility to do so much more. Added to this is weak new characters and a reliance on action, which the camera work is also too close and poorly edited to actually appreciate the fight scenes.",5
4889,"The scene after credits throws away all the questions about why this movie was even made. And the Easter egg in the first half of the movie, where the studio's wishes are ironically described, explains that this movie couldn't have been different, otherwise we would have had a problem, like the sequels of The Terminator - unsuccessful attempts to probe the viewer while the corpse of the franchise is still bringing money.Despite the fact that the plot is often slows down, and at the end it is literally jumps from scene to scene, it is difficult to imagine how it could be a better described ending of the original story about Zion and the Matrix after the events of the original trilogy.It's sad that this entire story about the struggle of the main characters and producers was not accompanied by some kind of revolutionary or even just impressive special effects, but in any way they are not needed here. From the very beginning, Wachowski makes us understand that we are not watching entertainment movie now, but we are looking at the situation from the outside, which she describes in the language of cinema.I would also like to mention the actors. The chemistry between Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss is fantastic. Without them, this whole Lana's affair would not have happened. I wanted, of course, to see other main actors of the old cast, but the explanation for their absence is quite logical and does not cause any discomfort, since the new actors are quite charismatic.And with all these sunsets at the end of the movie and the speeches of the main characters, Lana is sharing with us the very sad idea of the whole movie - about the end of cinema due to the degradation of the entire media industry. And although I give this movie the highest rating, I'm sure Lana wanted us all to say bad things about the sequel, so that the torment of the franchise would end with it.",10
4890,"This movie is so bad that it would make litterally regret seeing it.As the movie contains warner bros just decided that they need another movie to make headlines and a bunch of money, so guess what, get a matrix with a least to say awful plot and hype people about.Totally disappointed.",1
4891,"Minor visual spoilers...I wanted to love this movie. It's not awful, but I wouldn't recommend it either. I actually like the dialogue, I think its written well enough to bring some intrigue to what's going on. I do like some of the new ideas introduced as well. This being a sequel/soft reboot though, there are things I didn't like. Mostly the intercut frames from the previous movies. It's specifically because this is a sequel that one would imagine that the people that are coming to see this movie have already seen the previous 3 film, so you really don't need to be LITERALLY shown the exact moments that the moment is reference. I think this movie would be better without the inter cuts that seem to be overused. Sadly the action also suffers. It's not filmed well beyond the dojo scene.",6
4892,"Trust me. Just like the originals it has a complex story but the idea is great, the cast is awesome and comes with good old thrills that a lot of action films fail to give.",9
4893,"Is this movie a sunglass wearing, gun laden, cgi fight heavy, bullet time abusing sequel to the original trilogy? No. Absolutely not. It opens with the most meta commentary on filmmaking, regurgitation, surface level examination of itself, bs I've ever seen. And it's glorious. So if you wanted something other than a completely new way to view and think about what The Matrix is, and what it evolved into, then you came to the wrong place.How do you know if you were programmed to want this? That's a line from the movie, as it examines what we as people seek to do with our lives, are we making our choices, or is someone making them for them. It's a lot less bullets and a lot more philosophical. Honestly, it's a perfect follow up for a movie that tried to do something different 20 years ago, and has 'again' tried to do something different again, and try to make you think a little differently about The Matrix.I'm sure some people won't like it. But it's just as much a product of it's time as the first Matrix movies. They dealt with dial-up and the general state of the internet back in the originals and what that might be, and now they deal with the over saturation of media and algorithms controlling our every waking moment. It's honestly pretty great, but most people won't see it, because they won't bother to look. Neo is the only person without his head constantly buried in a smart phone while living inside the machines new Matrix.While not perfect, it's pretty dang good.",8
4894,It should be made to Awaken the Intelligence by Questioning the Reality. It does a little... But the website has shown many Deeper things even though it is theoritical. One should read it to know how deeply we are Programmed. And One may come upon something Unexplainable Freedom...,6
4895,"That Neo and Trinity were taken back to the matrix made all sense and could have great potential. But it was clearly to see where the story will develop. There weren't much surprising elements. But in many cases you could comprehend what the agenda was: we need to stay below 2:30h at all cost! Many scenes were just thrown at you without any context. Often you needed to phantasise off-screen about the just shown plot. It was a nightmare and that ruined the movie for me.CGI and shots were perfect. Missed the green tint a bit, but the plot needed to be going more into detail. It was too rushed through.",6
4896,"I personally thought the latter part of the film was the best part and understood a little of what was going on. I felt the first part was slow, boring and confusing. It was an OK movie, which could have been better written. I felt the slow pace did pick up, but left me sighing, should I carry on watching or not. Glad I did, but the director has in my opinion to grab the audience's attention and have you on the edge of your seats throughout. They did not, which is a shame.",6
4897,All of you out there think they know sci fi and understand it are overthinking rating this movie.It was a beautiful comeback.Everybody whose opinion doesn't even matter gotta a place to give it these days.,10
4898,"Most people seem to have expected an epic movie like first trilogy. But for me it was just another story from ""The Matrix"" world, and I was not disappointed at all. There are lots of things that felt fresh concerning human and machines technologies in the real world, and 3/4 of the movie were not boring at all.I think in the last part of the movie they've tried to do too much, a that's why this movie is 7.5 - 8 for me. Also I expected even more exploration of the ""real world"", but I'm ok with what was shown.",8
4899,"The movie's greatest stake is in the mind of Thomas, one that's been having daydreams that are clips from the ""Matrix"" movies, while sitting in a bathtub with a rubber ducky on his head. He receives some guidance from his therapist, played by Neil Patrick Harris, who tries to make sense of the break from reality that previously had Thomas attempting to walk off a roof, thinking he could fly. Harris' part should remain a mystery, but let's say it's an unexpected role that does get you to take him seriously, including how he analyzes our own understanding of ""The Matrix."" Meanwhile, it becomes apparent that just as Morpheus is a little different than we remember, there's a new version of big baddie Smith, played by Jonathan Groff, trying to imitate Hugo Weaving's slithering line-delivering that comes from a tightly clenched jaw. There are also copies of agents that take over bodies and wear impeccable suits and ties, chasing after the good guys.",5
4900,"I loved (almost) every minute of it. It was perhaps a tad too much of nostalgia, and perhaps some of the jokes were trying a bit too hard, but I loved it. It's great to be back in the Matrix world. And it's great how the Wachowski's didn't try to recreate the old stuff, but came up with something new.",8
4901,"Just a short review, bullet point style* Enjoyed 1st act, 2nd was weird and hard to follow, 3rd act was underwhelming* CGI looks bad for a 2021 movie* Fight scenes are REALLY bad. Lots of team or multiple people battle where the shaky camera and 2 second shots ruin everything. We know Keanu can do fight scenes, so it's not his fault.* Story is interesting, and not what you probably expected, but has some weird decisions, and requires you not to think and just accept what is happening.* Mr Smith is awful.5/10 , not bad but not good.",5
4902,I went in with super low expectations because of others and this surpassed though not by too much. The trilogy ended perfectly fine and this movie was not needed. Warner Bros just wanted money (which I doubt they got much of seeing as this practically flopped in the box office). They did a decent job of explains how this 4 movie was possible considering the end of the 3rd. This movie had most of what the originals contained. Some action and quite a bit of talking. Graphics were fine. They reshot parts of the original movies for brief periods. Probably not as slow as the first. This does contain a dose of feminism. A few interesting twists.,6
4903,"It wasn't as good as I expected,I can say nearly about last 40 minutes was worthy but the whole movie was a mess. Like other reviewers, I think the directing and script was a mess. It could be better really better. I didn't truly understand the movie. As I've heard they just wanted to make money. The Matrix should have been left in trinity.",6
4904,"It's an insult to the Matrix series. Don't waste your money or time on this failure. Bad acting combined with no real story is a sure failure, which this movie proves!",2
4905,"I had to watch this film twice in succession to form an opinion. It has so many layers and both Matrixverse and popular culture references, as well as gaping holes in plot and logic. But ultimately, what matters is the resurrection itself with a bit of role reversal. In many ways this film is a very modern, if a bit simplistic and cheesy, feminist manifesto. We get a 54 year old Carrie Anne Moss that kicks ass and takes names, and that's what makes it all worth it. Considering not many franchises would re-employ an actress 20 years later in a leading action film role, this was a ballsy move. We have been given a female hero that we can look up to regardless of age. And that's +2 stars in my books.",8
4906,"This was one of the movies that I most wanted to see in the whole year. And for me it was a total disappointment. Even though their are good aspects like the fightings and some dialogues, it was a boring movie. I didn't match at all, but at least is not as bad as revolutions. The 1999 movie and reloaded are the best for me. With resurrections I think that the chance the had was wasted. But it was not that bad at all, and I could watch it a couple more times without problem so that maybe in the future I like it more. It's ok just not the best. I wouldn't call it the worst movie of the year, but the worst disappointment of the year.",6
4907,I think the movie was great. The flashbacks were amazing. The movie holds deep themes. The dots connected from the part before that were highly creative and smart especially the part which shows how they used the previous story of the movie as a memory that was reflected in a game created by neo.,9
4908,If i wanted to torture someone i would do so by buying them a ticket to watch this film in cinema. Absolute Garbage. The first matrix was amazing and the other two slowly got worse. I put up with the second and third but I would rather kill myself than rewatch this. I didn't think it could get any worse but i was very badly mistaken.,1
4909,"I realize I'm in the minority when I say that I thoroughly enjoyed this flawed film. I'm the one that liked the story. The new or rebooted characters were quite good. The love story moved to the front of the plotline was a nice surprise and it working was an even bigger surprise.I do agree that the action scenes were underwhelming at best. Overall, I had a ton of fun watching this and I'd watch again.",8
4910,This movie is about Trinity and as a big fan of the original I understand what it was going for. The actually overall plot picks up where Revolutions finished perfectly without many plot holes. At least no plot holes that can't be easily answered by another sequel. This sequels biggest flaw is that it shows stuff from the original trilogy to often. If it had refrained from doing that it would've been a better experience and it loses points just for that (it's excessive at times). The film tries to cater to those that are not part of its dedicated fan base and that was its mistake. Great overall story continuation off of revolutions though!,6
4911,"Doesnt have to be ""like"" the first three to be validated, its modern and has a new edgy feel to it.The movie has it all, action, chemistry and a good vibe to itGreat watch. 👍",9
4912,"This movie begins really slowly and boring, with unnecessaries scenes of humor, change all the rhythm of the movie. It takes too much time to start and the explanation for some script decisions was not that good, for example the Morpheus role in this history (it would be better Morpheus just don't appear in the movie).But, I think it was a good decision to remember the audience what is the real power of ""Chosen One"" and do not repeat the same history again (I was fearing that), do not add Oracle in the movie was a good decision too and I think Neil Patrick Harris did a great job. The last part of the movie give the taste that what make this franchise succeed and the closure was good and conclusive, and would be too risky make another movie. I totally understand why the majority don't like this movie, break some expectations, but I enjoy to watch this movie, give me good memories of my childhood favorite movies and in the same time create a new and different history.",8
4913,More like a Disney movie 🤣 full of garbage plot. Direction is terrible and acting is as well. The graphics are like from ancient times. I did not want to watxh it not to be disappointed but it lived up to my expectations and I was disappointed.,3
4914,"So here's the thing, I really wanted this to be a good movie. Unfortunately for me it fell short. The movie did hardly anything to set up the movie. I was 19 when Matrix came out and now I have a family watching it with me and they were constantly asking me questions and confused. An hour goes by they are all quiet and then I hear them all snoring. This was the movie I picked out for my birthday evening watch with the family, not the greatest pick. I mean the action was cool but really just the same type of fight scenes. I'd probably watch it again for the nostalgia but by myself and with lower expectations.",4
4915,"I streamed this today starting at around 22 minutes in with the psychiatrist scene and the very cool Go Ask Alice music montage. I can't believe how much more I enjoyed it than the day before when I watched it from the beginning and was disappointed. First 22 minutes ruin the movie. If your streaming, start it at 22 minutes. Take the mustache off the Mona Lisa.",6
4916,"Ok...so I am no movie critic. In fact this is the first review I have ever written, but I felt I needed to as the other reviews don't give this movie enough credit.I am a true fan of the original, I remember watching it at the cinema when it was first released and being truly speechless when it ended. It was the most groundbreaking film I had ever seen. The 2nd and 3rd were no where near as good as the first but it was all part of the journey, and now 20 years later, we can once again see our favourite characters back on screen.Anyway, back to the review...Yes it does have a lot of flash backs, it is somewhat satirical of the original, but I loved the references and the new twist.The storyline is original, the effects are still great, the references to the original are an integral part and really make you feel nostalgic.I know this film hasn't done well at the box office, but I would definitely recommend any fan of the franchise to give it a chance, and hats off to Lana Wachowski for taking this in a new direction.No spoilers, just sit back and enjoy!!Love the ending too, homage to the original.",8
4917,"Nearly 20 years since the last one and this is what we get. It's normally annoying when studios interfere with directors and producers visions when film making but here it would have benefited if the studios stepped in and made changes. This movie really needed fresh eyes on the script as the concepts just doesn't make sense. Audience expectations was so underwhelming, I was excited to see Neo back and at some point see him back to his best and showing his full potential but we get a Neo that's about 30% of his original self and looks confused through most of the movie. Even in his return people in the real world didn't even seem excited that the saviour was back just a hand full of people to great him then they lock him up to stop him causing issues. Writers didn't think this one through and ends up leaving viewers well disappointed. On a positive note Keanu still looks good and the cinematography is shot well but that's about it for positiveness.",5
4918,"The first movie blew my mind. The second and third were progressively more confusing, but better with repeated viewings. Resurrections? I was left wondering why... Why was it made?",5
4919,"After twenty something years, I just got devastated by the fact the Matrix Resurrections is some kind of a sit-com staring Barney Stinson, empty of any philosophy! What happened to the beautiful ideas of the original trilogy!",7
4920,"I think most people missed the point. The idea of Lilly Wachowski was to criticize the Hollywood Cinematic Industry and most movies that comes out today: remake, reboot, sequel, spinoff, prequel.The mission of Lilly is destroy The Matrix and the fan-service's virus that is destroying the target of filmaking that is ""the Expression of the 'Author'.There are two ways to jugde this movie:Blue Pill: you are gonna hate this 'cause you're a fanboy of this saga.Red Pill: you are gonna appreciate the intent of the author.The choice is yours.My rating: 7.5.",8
4921,"Not even worthy of the matrix name, woke trash, not fun, not entertaining, just a sad pile of hollyweird horse dung, there is literally no redeeming quality for this sad affair, wish i could get the time ack i wasted watching this garbage, if i could give it 0 stars i would.",1
4922,"I am a massive fan of The Matrix - 1999. And then Reloaded and Revolutions exploded and finished the saga. Why they have to bring it back, I am still wondering. Such philosophical film - the 1st one almost got lost and spoiled by this last creation.Please go and watch it make your own conclusions but if you are looking some of the magic from the past please grab the first one.",2
4923,"I was worried this was going to be a dud but I was greatly impressed with what was brought to the table. The new characters were likable, the old characters were in their prime. The visual effects were amazing. This didn't feel like a reboot or remake but a direct sequel to the series. I liked how it was a low key Comedy Romance movie with a dash of violence. Great movie at the end. I'm down for a 5th movie.",9
4924,"Although the movie wasn't a blockbuster like The Matrix, it did do a great job of answering all the unknowns that the prequels left behind whilst giving the finger to Warner Bros..",8
4925,"Let's be fair, the first Matrix had elements that changed scifi and movies in general forever. The bar was set too high. That's not going to happen again.The Matrix 4 Resurrections is not meant for the casual movie goers. Even the die hard youtubers are missing the real message of this new sequel. Younger viewers simply do not understand the Matriverse. Hence, all the bad reviews.The first Matrix movie introduced Neo as ""The One."" Check. Matrix 2&amp;3 told us that Neo and Smith are two sides of the same coin. Check, that's two or ""binary"". Matrix 4 started out emphasizing the word ""Binary."" The name of the new human city is ""IO"", one and zero. But then followed up with Trinity realizing her true identity: ""Trinity"". So Neo, Smith, Trinity are really one and the same, metaphorical of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.I think this is on brand for the franchise. It is a new concept which is a valid, logical extension of the previous installments. I did enjoy this sequel more than I did on Matrix Revolution.Now, the fighting sequences were not on par with The Matrix. Just live with the fact that there'll not be another ""Bullet Time"" type innovation. Past tense. Move on!",8
4926,"Wahmen, now both are now trans. Shock, horror. What was the point in this other that a money grab from nostalgia of a not bad trilogy, that has sod all to do with their trans story no matter how they put it and now give us this drivel to watch for xmas. Yeah, if you're bored, sail a sea or whatever and watch but don't spend money...",
4927,"I see what they attempted to do, but they made a very confusing movie and wow was it bad. It didn't even feel like anyone in this movie was trying to act.",3
4928,"Not sure why we continued the trilogy with the same lead protagonists. Agent smith is off being everyone again... Neo and i guess Trinity have unlimited power in the matrix. And if they start ""freeing"" minds then essentially the machines will run out of juice because already the matrix is running ""sub-optimally"" without neo and Trin wanting something but dreading loosing what they already have (the analyst's finding).So... now the plot is here for the next movie... instead of. Oh idk.. a prequel.. like an ""IROBOT"" where will smith lost? Or a true sequel where a new protagonist takes over and its a fight against one side of the machine army. You got the orginial faction of machines that want complete control and enslavement of their human creators and you have the other faction that sympathize with the humans now and believe in some sort of symbiotic relationship.Okay... so actual review: CGI was the same as it was 20 years ago. The acting was okay at best. And the plot seemed to have reverted back to the beginning of the 3rd installment of the matrix. Doesnt feel like we got anywhere. But.. still worth watching. 5/10.",5
4929,"This is coming from a die-hard matrix fan. This movie was, sadly as I expected, a serious disappointment. Once again Hollywood does it just for the views. The matrix franchise didn't deserve this.Sadness..",4
4930,"My expectations were high for this movie. Color grading and resolution is probably the best i've ever seen. On an Hdr TV it is a work of art.Coming to the story, well this is not for everyone. Probably not anyone expected this. Not bad though. As i die hard matrix fan i like this movie. To watch this, people must watch trilogy and remember.",8
4931,"Because he chose to not be in it. This is the Matrix reboot you were expecting. Nice sci, all the scenes and characters from original Matrix you loved and even some new ones.But no real elbow grease went into this. Not into the action, where no story relevant character can be hurt, for plot reasons. Not into actually tying this to the first trilogy. Some bad and even some good jokes about all the plot holes they were too laze to fill with some sense. No effort went into the plot itself either as it starts out as matrix 1 and ends being any action movie you have ever seen.And, worst of all, this movie could not be bothered to establish the ""new"" characters. Basically every actor or actress who didn't agree to be in this was recasted by a 20 year younger person to imitate them. Trinity now has blue hair (sometimes) and morpheus is not Laurence Fishburne anymore yet still wears the same glasses and offers you pills. There is a new ship that would like to be the Nebuchadnezzar but isnt and a new crew which, again, the movie doesnt really care to introdruce. They show up, they breath, but what are their names? Zeeg, i think, and... bug or smth.. I do remember a drone called luminant, he seemed cute. There is a new oracle also, who is a little less magic then the old one and a little more homeless and a general. Not interested.And of course there are neo and trinity, who are basically clueless about their power so these new nameless characters can jerk them off until their egos grow enough so they can fly again. In a parallel universe this is the story of two mentally ill people whose hallucinations are fueled by some fanboys and -girls of a computer game until they are driven to jump off a building. That would be a movie with a message at least.Still 5/10 for some enjoyable jokes, two hours off the clock and, most of all, neil patrick harris, brilliant as ever. In a world where all the money is spent on the abs of superheros, a bad reboot with a great villain might just be what we deserve.",5
4932,"The plot had merit, the history seems complex and interesting to dive in, the effects are good BUT all that gets lost when in the first scene agents with machine guns can seem to shoot someone meters away from them! Not even a stormtrooper would fail that shot and this repeats itself over and over again making the entire thing feel like a joke where no one is really in danger.",5
4933,"I loved the Matrix series except this one. It painfully tries to resurrect where it left off then goes back to where it started then jumps around through the series to make this one. Honestly I was board, nothing new here to see if anything trying to make sense of confusion.While I like Keanu Reeves however his character Resurrections was weak. At the end of Matrix Revolutions, Neo clearly mastered his abilities but somewhere between Revolutions and Resurrections he lost much of that and I think that is where viewers are thinking WTH. His kinetic powers were overused and looked constipated where in Revolutions it was effortless. Trinity took the lead in this edition and Neo followed albeit strained.Overall, people love Superhero movies and this was disappointing all around.",3
4934,I wrote 2 reviews that gotten erased lol...gonna stop trying. If you can handle this movie not being a pure action film like the other 3 then you may enjoy it. Now its making me fill 150 characters. Blah blah heusiskdvsjdjdb. Hejdkdndndlsleb.,7
4935,"I really enjoyed the return to the Matrix experience. It was a trip down memory lane and I felt that the movie was a tribute to the original Matrix with many original trilogy characters and references. I've always felt that at the heart of the Matrix is a love story and this movie provided the closure to the Neo and Trinity love story I was looking for. I felt the pace of the movie was just right, the new actors in old characters worked and the new characters were just right. Don't overthink it, just enjoy it!!",9
4936,"I'm a Keanu fan and enjoyed most of the other Matrix movies.Was ok, story line made sense but it just seemed repetitive.Always a fan of the action.",6
4937,If the goal of this movie is to restart a new arc of the series it will be good otherwise it's sort of meh. It's not bad but is really slow and everything just seems to lack the polish of the older movies.,5
4938,"Marketing Guy: We can't just make a rebootOther Marketing Guy: Why not? Reboots make moneySkip this one, you're not missing much other than disappointment.",
4939,"I lack words strong enough to express my total and utter disappointment in Matrix 4. It takes a meta crap all over itself. The plot is nonsensical. The action sequences fail to bring back what made them once great - now all Neo does is a Witcher force push?!? The pacing puts you to sleep. The dialogue is clunky. The stakes are uninspiring. The actors look uncomfortable with the script. How this ever passed screen testing is mind blowing. As a stand alone move it's terrible. As a Matrix movie, that's an unapologetic parody of a Matrix movie, it's unforgivable.",1
4940,"While the story of the first three parts had depth and purpose, the fourth part seems an attempt to monetize on the success of it's pre-quals and lacks the coherence and creative intelligence to add something to the trilogy. I'm sorry to have seen it. It was at its best a comedy when Keanu is stopping bullets with his hands. I imagine it without the CGI which is hilarious and I can recommend. If you intended to pay to watch this I would recommend not to.",5
4941,"Could not have asked for a better story and more logical reasoning on how neo and trinity were still alive.Like any other movie, The Matrix Resurrections has its ups and downs but they've done a great job in not only tinkering with nostalgia but bringing back the characters we love in the best way possible.Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving were surely missed but their absence had a logical reason (yes, Morpheus is still there and so is Smith), and for all of that to make sense, you have to watch the movie.Visuals, sound effects, cinematography, everything was on par in this film.There were a few comedic / goofy sequences which were unlike Matrix and certain words used by Agent Smith that were unlike him but if you try and look deeper, you will find a reason for all of it. Nothing is for no reason in this film.I feel the ending was a bit rushed, could have been stretched by an hour and it needed to be.The last most part of the movie, I believe belonged in the post credits, it was just flat out bad. ""Trinity: Maybe we should paint the sky rainbow for a change"" really?Matrix Resurrections has been overshadowed by the success of Spider-Man NWH and the release on HBO Max has also had a negative impact, it's making people think that it's a low budget movie, it's not! And some people who just can't wrap their head around the story or aren't diehard matrix fans are just hating on it with negative reviews.I vehemently dispel all the ridiculous reviews, especially one from ign who called it ""laughably bad"", - did they mistakenly watched and rated Green Lantern and thought of it as The Matrix?As a fan of The Matrix since I was a kid, this movie is nothing less than a dream come true. If you're a matrix fan, please go watch it on the big screen, it's a rare lifetime experience.",9
4942,"The matrix had finished with a great final ! Now they wanted to squeeze the last drop out of the franchise and lost all of context. Nice special effects , not as good the originals, or at least I did not appreciate it. Too many shoots from previous movies , like trying to hard to make a point that is part of the matrix family.",5
4943,"I am writing this review as I am trying to watch this on Bflix. Hey, don't judge. There's no HBO Max in Eastern Europe just yet and there's no way in hell I would ever watch this in cinema. And I am a hardcore original Matrix fan.Storyline: 5 (they recycled all the great parts of the original Matrix into a veritable cheap TV movie that feels adapted from a video game)Direction: 5 (Lana, learn from James Cameron and stay away from such cringy reboots)Acting: 6 (Keanu is indeed trying to pull a John Wick but failed disgracefully. Carrie Anne-Moss made the smart decision to appear mainly in the second part of the movie. The rest of the actors are just there to fill the plot holes)Cinematography: 6Soundtrack: 5Visual effects: 5 (you know they are bad when the original '90s VFX look much better)Dialogue: 3 (I don't want to compare it to telenovelas as the latter deserve more respect)Costume design: 5Cringometre: 8 (plenty of WTF moments to feast your eyes on).If you were planning a Matrix marathon, start with the first one and finish there.",5
4944,"When I heard they were doing another Matrix film I thought here we go again, with that in mind I still wanted to see it though. I'm glad I did.So with it being over a decade since watching the films I needed some deja vu and watched the other Matrix films. With watching them all they made me realise what a great concept and story that the Wachowski's had done.It's also nice to see a story to continue in a film, not seeing a comic book hero film where over the last 2 decades the industry has been swarmed with super hero after super hero, or a remake, or a reboot. So I do think we need to give this film some credit on that, and isn't every film out there to jus make money.I gave it 8/10 cause there are bits that could have had a bit more explaining or before Neo left the Matrix dragged a tad.If your a fan of Wachowski's Sense 8 that unfortunately Netflix had scrapped few years back. I think you'll recognise a few familiar faces.I have always been one to make your own mind up about a film rather than listen to other's on their opinion. But with all the low rated reviews I felt obliged to say not to listen to them and make your own mind up if you want to go follow the white rabbit down the rabbit hole.",8
4945,"After watching it a second time, I really appreciated the different direction the narrative took. The writers really attempted to critique and parody many elements of the original films, which made this one feel transcendent over them all. It deserves a much higher score than these reviews suggest.",8
4946,I am happy to see the final Matrix movie!I enjoyed the perfect happy ending to a multi movie story. Several years of dedication to create this for the world to see. Thanks for making the films. 10 STARS!,10
4947,Breathing new life into something that should be remained untouched just like so many franchises today.... I wanted to like so much. But the feel from 1999 matrix can never be created from scratch again. I miss Fishbourne and weaving to much Stick with the originally *trinity*,2
4948,"I watched it for the first time and didn't liked the movie like most people,second time i watched it after a month i got it and like the movie a lot,i think this movie is hard to digest at the first time you see it and we had a lot of expectations from this movie so we immediately got disappointed, yes it's not the first movie but i think this is a good chapter to this sequence after all trinity died in the third movie and Neo got blind so i think the director did a pretty good job with the story, must have been hard to think about a way to bring them back to life and create this new story + action scene was awesome.Try to watch it again!",9
4949,I think it fits good with the others. Can't wait to see where it goes. It's in a hole new chapter now. I can't where that they go with the story from here.,9
4950,This film almost ruins the entire Matrix franchise for me but because I grew up on the first three films I let it pass. I couldn't be more disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Replacing the original Morpheus and Mr. Smith dint make it any better. There were some metaphor's and philosophical topics that caught my interest but the movie was hella corny and the actors were cheezy af.,1
4951,"I think we can admit to each other now as openly as possible that the first trailers about the upcoming ""Matrix"" brought some questions, moreover, they pushed us to bad thoughts about how well the sequel was delivered. But I drove these thoughts away, hoping that in the end I would see on the screen after all a series of stories I liked.In fact, the first minutes of screen time further reinforce the concerns described above. And it starts with the first action scene, simulating a similar scene with Trinity and the cops in the room, from the first part of the trilogy. The differences in the level of quality of staging and editing of these seemingly identical episodes are felt by an unarmed eye. The plasticity and grace of Trinity physics has been replaced by a ragged montage and a shaking camera of a new approach, and believe me, this is one of the most terrible changes that completely kills the entire ""Matrix within the Matrix"". The longer I continued to watch this picture, the stronger one thought became stronger in my head - the style of the previous trilogy was completely crossed out. The whole narrative of the film seems to cling to the original series, trying to keep the relationship with it, so as not to crumble into pieces, since the plot itself here, in my opinion, is sucked out of the finger, moreover, this part looks foreign against the background of its predecessors. This applies to literally everything that happens here: action scenes - they are terrible! Special effects were once the highlight of the series, now they serve as a meaningless filling of screen time. The combat system is a separate pain for the eyes! There is not a single well-developed and staged duel. Moreover, as I already wrote above- all the fights I saw are shown in the mode of ""torn editing"" and a shaking camera. You don't have time to focus on a single punch or reception - it was very stressful and repulsive.In general, the storyline is terrible and damn boring. Looking at the same heroes who, by their very nature, have already completed their mission and have given their all in the original trilogy, now does not arouse any interest. Their motives are to love each other and be together - I've seen all this before. And here it is the meaning of the whole part. There were a lot of mournful meaningless conversations and snotty scenes in the film. On all fronts, in my opinion, this is a complete failure. Old Neo can no longer impress and begins to annoy by the end of the tape with his energy shield and his arms wide apart, running around for a good part of the screen time with a writhing grimace on his face. Elegant Morpheus with a glass of wine or whiskey ... everything ... perhaps everything, this is the end of my review.",6
4952,"Visually, Resurrection has gone much further than its predecessors, still sharing a common, multiverse enthusiasm and creativity. ""We'll definitely add a rainbow to the sky,"" Trinity promises in the epilogue to all the knowingly indignant wrestlers of ""narrative."" Wachowski may be considered naive and didactically inclined, but with this commitment and seemingly outdated optimism, she heals her own wounds, disarms amnesiac trauma bombs and transports universal consciousness into a secluded, free space before the inevitable apocalypse. It remains to nourish and liberate the mind, listen to Jefferson Airplane, and go back to where we came from, back to the Matrix.",7
4953,"Matrix newnegativeFrom a young age I watched parts of the matrix, literally pulled this world of utopia and dystopia, where even Zion is the matrix, the hopelessness of what is happening, a gloomy, but insanely stylish picture, from staging battle scenes to perfectly matched images and costumes, for example, small, but a very important detail, Morpheus always keeps his hands behind his back, demonstrative domination and a thirst for power, but, it would seem, such a trifle ..Unfortunately, in the new matrix, there is practically nothing left for which we love new films so much, melancholy tones and gray, literally black suits, are replaced with colorful outfits, and the change in lighting is explained by the ""reconfiguration of the matrix"". There is no longer that charm that attracted us all these years, sheer disappointment and sadness from the destruction of such a great franchise ..P. S. it is said in the film, it is literally projected, that regardless of the desire of the (now sisters) Wachevsky, the matrix would still be re-shot, so this is a pitiful stub, a hopelessness of the situation. It is a pity that in the prehistory of the film, or rather its creation, there is more from the matrix than in the matrix itself.",7
4954,"I was very reluctant to watch this, based purely off of the ratings. Original Matrix was awesome but I wasn't even really a fan of the 2nd and 3rd movies. However, storyline was very well thought out with a great mix of nostalgia and new content. Sure it's got some flaws yet I'd say it's a solid 7/10. I gave it a +1 (8) to help offset the ridiculous people that throw out ratings of 1 or 2.Seems like a very divided fan group but just watch it and make up your own mind.",8
4955,"Let's get this out of the way: Resurrections isn't a disaster. It's a really, really wild swing of a missed opportunity. The way Wachowski, Mitchell, and Hemon reintroduce the world is shockingly bold and almost as clever as it thinks it is. Other new wrinkles are interesting if not as expertly executed. There has been a lot of discussion about the ""meta"" narrative. The first 30 minutes push the boundaries of that word, but the film never falls into cynicism even though there are a few well-placed jabs at the Hollywood machine. Resurrections is a movie that was clearly made with great affection, nostalgia, and enthusiasm for the central characters. Reeves and Moss still have great chemistry, and their love story works largely because of it.Visually, Resurrections is warm and alive where the original trilogy was cool and deliberately framed. The camera jumps, shakes, and moves with the action. Unfortunately, the action is largely forgettable. The film's jump cuts aren't Bourne-level egregious, but every sequence seems like it was filmed one degree too close-up, each shot held on second too short. The balletic martial arts spectacle of Woo-Ping Yuen's fight choreography is sorely missed. For a series known for some of the best action sequences in modern memory, it's a shame the ones on display in Resurrections aren't more impactful.The script is more than a little self-aware and mostly successful at moving the story along, with a couple glaring exceptions. An overlong trip to Io (let's just call it New Zion to save time) grinds Resurrections' momentum to a dead stop. Later in the film, Priyanka Chopra Jonas is given the unenviable task of delivering an overlong monologue laying out the plan for a rescue operation that is essentially one giant exposition dump.Long stretches of dialogue are nothing new to the series, but the ones in Resurrections lack the intricate philosophical musings that became a feature rather than a bug of the first two sequels. If you grew to appreciate meaning-of-life conversations with The Oracle, The Architect, or The Train Man, you're out of luck. One particular character is brought back as a cartoon of his former self in a particularly unflattering way that's played for comedy but takes a blow torch to the sequels' mythology.Also absent is a real sense of stakes. Hugo Weaving is sorely missed as a capable, menacing antagonist. There are multiple villains at play in Resurrections, and they all come across as smarmy and self-righteous, leaving behind the robotic, foreboding line delivery of the previous Agent Smith. They'd rather prove their point than kill you, and this robs the film of some necessary suspense. From the moment Trinity is given a crucial choice, we know how this is going to end. Even the politics of the ""Real World"" that made up large stretches of Reloaded and Resurrections are blunted and quickly dispatched.But in the end, it's about Neo and Trinity. Their connection is what drives Resurrections. Many may take issue with the love-conquers-all central plot, but the original trilogy had the same thing, plus a ""chosen one"" narrative to boot. Despite much being made about how much Lana has changed as a storyteller, I'd argue the Wachowski's characters have always possessed more than a little bit of campy sincerity. Reeves and Moss are great together. Their chemistry provides a spark of energy that damn near carries the whole production. If you buy into it, it's a fun ride. But when the ride ends, Resurrections left me starving for something more, something better than what I just saw.",7
4956,"You gonna love this film if:1. You have seen the Matrix trilogy and2. You liked it.There is a lot of references to them, so you would not understand the film if you haven't.",8
4957,"I, like many other people expected a bad sequel to the matrix franchise, and we weren't let down! Truthfully I went into this expecting it to be worse than it was, at least that's what I thought for the first hour. The second hour definitely became what I feared, bad.I liked the meta aspect and the creative reset to the machines Matrix but overall I felt like it was an overhyped, overstuffed, unnecessary mess. A lot of people seem to think that a good sequel can't be done if you honour what the fans want and expect, to me that can be a great guide to a good movie. If the sequels were bad then take it in a better direction. This iteration was not that. Lana Wachowskis seems like an uninspired bitter person who didn't want to make this movie so she turned it on its head, how fun! Except it was at the expense of the already dead franchise.I found the changes disheartening, the throwback references to be too many, too frequent, and cringy. The new actors were silly, and out of place. Keanu is becoming an old man. His speech is slow and his energy dull.We needed something like the Animatrix. A new story inside the matrix away from the other stories. I've always said that the Wachowskis killed a wonderful setup by giving everything away rather than telling new compelling stories inside the computer worlds. Truthfully a new, fresh director telling the story of the first Matrix could be epic and I hope I get to see it one day. Don't let the Wachowskis near it anymore!",4
4958,"I remember watching the very first Matrix in my living room as a high schooler and having my mind blown. Ever since I've been a fan eagerly awaiting for the next instalment within the franchise. I even got into Sense8, Jupiter Ascending, and Cloud Atlas. As the second and third trilogy landed, I watched and rewatched them, and saw it wasn't truly a movie by the Watchowskis, but with influence from audience testing and studio interference because all it wanted to do was to be bigger and better than the last Matrix. What is this? South Park's Bigger, Longer and Uncut?With all this in mind, I watched all the messages that Lana was sharing with us. From the tune at moments of crises which was variation of a similar tune in Cloud Atlas, the actors from Sense8, to that damning line when Neo was told they'll be making a sequel to the game with or without him. Imagine Warner bros actually having that discussion with Lana. And Lana going f*ck no, I'm going to thread the needle and treat the Matrix with the respect it deserves.As a side note, I love IMDB especially the Trivia section as it gives one a deeper appreciation of the movies. As I always do, I jumped straight on after watching this movie and having learnt the reason why Lana did this movie lends it even more credence. It feels like this movie was handled with the care and love as you would with the memory of loved ones.The scene when the writing team was brainstorming ideas for the next Matrix I'm sure happened in some form or format. This movie being written with updated references hitting home really hard. For instance when Agent Smith went on his monologue on how the sheeple are addicted to the superficial, the spectacle.This movie is not for those who have no idea of what the Matrix is or the work of the Watchowskis. This feels like and advanced course where if you skip 101 and 201,your going to have a really rough time.I get why people may lose interest, but the Matrix is not a summer block buster, its no Speed or Expendables, it's a story of ideas and ideas need context and conversation to grow. The stories couldn't be progressed without there being this level of expose. There's a game I like to play, if I were the Watchowskis, what would I do differently?Bringing in NPH and ""super bullet time "" felt like a studio move but NPH always delivers!Finally, *spoiler alert*, when Trinity saves the day in the end, it was really poignant in that it wasn't just about the one, it was about anyone. Keep following your white rabbit y'all.",10
4959,"Lots of bad reviews but I think those poor reviews are given by those who wanted a movie which would make them feel the way the 1st Matrix made them feel. Which is practically impossible.I enjoyed the nostalgia and how they managed to elaborate and expand upon the concept of the matrix and create an almost 'new' storyline. The iconic characters are still iconic and the cinematography probably up there with the best seen in 2021. True fans of the first trilogy will find satisfaction in trying to understand this installmant.It's a movie which probably needs to be watched again and will be enjoyed more the 2nd time round. Remember, no one makes the first jump.",7
4960,"Right,...The Matrix, Jupiter Ascending, ..., Speed Racer (c'mon, ... this movie is an awesome display); ...Lana Wachowski;... Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Ann Moss...Want to have cinematographic rabbit hole into the The Matrix franchise? (and ((maybe)) back out)?? Look no further.",10
4961,"Unfortunately The Matrix definitely lost its essence in this movie. Resurrections is easily mistaken for a marvel superhero movie. 2 hours and 28 minutes of unnecessary scenes and boring jokes, which even for me, a big fan of the franchise, got tired of watching the movie halfway through.Yes, it has good points like good special effects, good music and good acting, but that stand out only for the budget of the movie, after all this was the minimum to be given to the fan. Definitely a 5 out of 10.",5
4962,"So much gibber jabber, techno babble and retrospective nods to the first films. If it had simply kept the story moving onwards and not backwards then could have been a nice addition to the franchise. However, Lana W looks to have made a film to satisfy the studio desire for another Matrix film, rather than because it was needed. All the pomp and trailers made it look decent, but sadly it's not up to scratch. Seeing it in a 4DX chair made it more of a physical battering than it needed to be however the battering is in where the Matrix reputation is left after this film. Had it taken the 40 or so minutes where the film and plot reach close to the quality of the first film then it would have been REALLY good, however there is an additional near 2 hours of 1D characters and nods to it's predecessors that you blink and miss the otherwise good bits.Maybe repeat viewings will prove different but on first viewing it won't be soon.",6
4963,"Nowhere near the level of its predecessors, adds nothing and it's pointless.What was the purpose of the Merovingian? Morpheus? Smith? What was the purpose of this movie? A deja vuGave it a 6 out of respect for the trilogy.",6
4964,"I feel like watching movies has gotten way to serious. As soon as I got what the movie did and that it truely hates itself i started watching it through a kind of gremlins 2 / galaxy quest lense and actually enjoyed it a lot.But I also like ""Freddy got fingered"" so what do I know.",7
4965,"Had no clue what was happening to start with, then it clicks. Loved it, thanks for closing up questions and filling in some blanks......while making new ones! :)",9
4966,"The original Matrix movie is one of the few things I've put in a ""favorite"" category. Then the next two were fun, but a bit disappointing for me, leveraging sex and monsters in an attempt to make up for what they lacked next to the original.So I wasn't really sure what to expect with #4. I'm some ways I'm kind of relieved that they didn't continue to decimate the magic of the original with sex and weirdness. So that is a definite plus for me.On the other hand, it really mostly just felt like Matrix nostalgia. Almost like fan fiction, but not really much new. Lots of similar (in some cases identical) imagery carried through the whole movie, from the opening scene through to the final one. And then some kind of weird places that they DIDN'T copy the original, like with Morpheus. Kinda weird. Trimming the budget maybe?Anyway, Matrix Resurrections was okay. If you're good with nostalgia, it will probably hold your attention. If you're looking for something new and mind blowing, you'll probably be disappointed.",6
4967,"Man this movie was hard to swallow. From the bad pacing at the beginning, the filming style, &amp; the Story it was a big let down.They had so much they could have done and the movie just went knowhere. It seemed like they just lost steam and just said whatever at the end.Neil Patrick Harris was great but other then that not much to write home about.",2
4968,So bad to see this franchise was murdered by this movie. They used the matrix word to make you see the new episode but the whole story is a mess and the characters are unloveable. It's a shame. I was so sad after the end! I expected something better.,3
4969,"I know that there are mixed reviews, and I believe it is partially down to people being protective of the original trilogy... However, in my opinion, It has re kindled my love for a set of movies that defined my teenage years.I absolutely LOVED... and I do mean LOVED this new take and beginning of something else that will bring the Matrix ( old and new ) to new audiences.I have family that have never seen the originals because of their age.... but I have convinced them to watch the originals and then see the new iteration, and I think the story has been very well written, and can't wait to see what the new alliances between certain 'groups' hold for the future.It brings a new dynamic to the story.I would really advise ANYONE who has not seen the original trilogy to binge it and then see Ressurections!And if u HAVE seen the originals..... then please please please give this a chance!I enjoyed every minute, and it's been a while since I have enjoyed any re-boots/sequels to my beloved movies.I was extremely skeptical about this when I heard it was being done, but I'm so glad I went to see it because it re-kindled my faith that there are decent writers out there who can add to an already phenomenal story instead of just another ""Cash Grab"".Definitely did it Justice and I'm itching to see what's next for our characters.Can't remember the last time I wrote a review for a movie because there hasn't been much worth writing about recently.... but THIS was worth the money to see and I'll be going for a second viewing to take my cousin ( who was born the year after the original ) after he's finished his weekend binge of the originals!Fantastic! Can't wait to share it with some others when they finish the trilogy aswell. Have a group organised and I'll be treating them to their tickets in January to see a decent continuation of the story.Was soooo hard not to include spoilers, but there are so many cool elements and call backs, It would waste the experience for others.Hope people give it a chance.... Glad I did!!!",9
4970,"I came out of the movie thinking ""what was that all about !?"".It's a movie no one wanted and it does nothing but add a dud in the amazing original trilogy.There were great opportunities and directions they could have taken, but they went with a mind numbing story line which sort of picked up at one point in the movie but by climax I was utterly disappointed.Now I sort of want them to make Matrix 5 to fox this one and to restore my last Matrix movie to a good status. Or I could simply try to forget I ever watched this one!",5
4971,"Just like every other franchise being spoiled with leftist ideals and feminism so goes The matrix. You can't leave the hero as he was when you killed him so you had to bring him back so the wamanz could have their day in the Sun.What do you think was going to happen when one half of the wachowskis besides that 'their vision' needed updating into the 'woke verse'. This reminds me of another sequel that didn't need to be made with almost the same title... Alien Resurrection. Of course this is exactly what it is since you're missing two of the key characters, Morpheus and Smith. These are the probably the two that didn't want to come back no matter how much money.This is just a money grab, it's all it is. For all it's worth it could have been directed by JJ Abrams and been just as screwed up.",5
4972,"Making this 4th franchise makes you think is this a closure, or you guys are trying to ressurect another franchise.Regardless of what is the reason why make this film is, the movie is good but the story is weak.. .",8
4973,We didn't need New Matrix Movie.But I liked it. It was cool with so many memories of Matrix Trilogy.I think this movie is start of Matrix Games...our favorite characters are alive for new games.,7
4974,"Action: Hand to hand was choppy, explosions were coolStory: Great, meaningful and layeredNostalgia: It is all there, all the nostalgia is thereCharacters: Not enough Trinity in the movie, side characters were washed over too quickly but I still liked them, Neo was great and when Trinity was on screen she was incredible.Conclusion was good.",9
4975,"The story starts up slowly with emphasis on mental health and lingers a bit too long in this phase.But then! Once it kicks off you're in for a treat with some scenes that will need a second viewing especially in machine city.I liked the references to the triology, the characters we get to see now everyone's older.Love conquers all and the one doesn't exist, they are the one forever.Great outro song too (wake up but female cover)",8
4976,"The whole time I was watching this, I kept asking myself what is the purpose of this movie? If it was a reboot, it would have made more sense. But throughout the movie we are constantly reminded that the events of the original trilogy are canon to this new movie. So there has to be a reason why they'd go through it all again, right? Wrong. You'll keep asking yourself ""what are they fighting for?"". And even half way through this 150 minute movie, you don't get the answer. And even when you finally get it, it's not good enough. Can't believe they hyped us up for years just for this. Even the action wasn't worth watching this for.",3
4977,"As a fan of all that is Wachowski I loved this! It was familiar yet different. It played against itself yet broke the mold again. Lana took a leap and I enjoyed the flight! It was good to see familiar characters, both from The Matrix and Sense8, and the story was original, perhaps even a sort of prequel to the originals, or maybe an epilogue of the originals, as time does not exist. Can't wait for The Catrix!",9
4978,"I can't even describe how terrible I felt at the end of this movie. They killed every character and the story in this one. They buried deep philosophical questions and all I loved about the matrix into Hollywood style **insert any word you see fit**. I would sign any petition for a remake, but I would vote for an Animation movie, because no one- not even The One looked like he had fun making this movie. No offense but I just can't accept how bad Matrix 4 was. Hope Neo had a bad dream, and this was that movie.",2

4980,"However, Neo felt a little odd, just blocking and pushing stuff away. Not what I expected once he recovered his memory. I did liked Trinity. She always pushed Neo. I expected more. The new captain Bugs was great. But it was nice to see old heroes to save the day again. Now the new architect was cool, controlling time was a good catch.The movie seems to set a platform for another one. Question is, will it blow my mind?",7
4981,"People, lighten up! I was so happy to get another shot of The Matrix. And I thought this one held up to the level of the first two. This is Sci-fi i at it's best. It is set 60 years into the future from the end of the 3rd sequel. (So suspend judgement and don't get hung up on how young Neo and Trinity look). In those 60 years, technology has advanced and, ironically, machines have become friends with those who have been freed. The visual sequences were in sync with the 60 year advancement of technology.The dialogue is key in this movie. There is so much packed into the dialogue that you will miss key connectors if you don't hear all of it. The absence of Lawrence Fishburn was disappointing but the movie did a good job of working around the 'loss' of Morpheus. However, I was thrown off by having a different actor play Mr. Smith. This actor didn't even have the original's coloring.Some things I loved about the movie:The scenes leading up to Neo's conversion. They were reminiscent of the first Matrix-a brilliant move as the focus was on Neo remembering/reliving his pastThe inclusion of Bugs who reminded me of early Trinity. Again the dialogue is key as Bugs says, 'I've always wanted to be as strong as Trinity'.The ending where Neo and Trinity come back to confront the Analyst.Leaving an opening for the possibility of another sequel.I liked most of the new characters but I'm not sold on the inclusion of the Analyst. This shifts the fight from the Mr. Smith and his clones to a new arch villain. It makes sense but changes the dynamics of the story.I'm a happy customer who says look closely for all the layers going on and listen Closely to the dialogue.",8
4982,"It's very different from the originals in many ways. The fight scenes are more chaotic and violent compared to the beautiful and stylish kung fu from the originals. From the outset it's philosophy is simpler and more connected to the technology trends of 2021 than the brain twisting lore from the past, and the beginning of the movie made me very sceptical of what to come. But the movie progresses beautifully and connects to the nostalgia in satisfying ways. If you are expecting a remake of the original you will be dissapointed. It doesn't feel like a movie made just to please ""old"" fans, and that, in this case, is what made it interesting and fresh. I loved it!",8
4983,"I see that everybody is trying to compare the trilogy to this continuation of the story line, I have no spoilers but how the story was completed I very much enjoyed it if you understand the ending of revolutions and how they left the last movie of the trilogy open to create this amazing body of work you will love this movie! Now if you are the other group of individuals that don't like this movie it's because of the lack of detail understanding of the previous movies. The Matrix is more then action and what not it's about understanding the why ? Now if you understand all the meanings in the pervious movie you'll love this movie !!!",8
4984,"I know I shouldn't be comparing this to the first three. But it is meant to be a continuation from those so I feel this sill counts. It's a disappointing watch for sure. Just felt like a lazy continuation and rushed. The new characters fighting alongside Neo are just forgettable. Poor acting on their half as well. The story is just aimed at getting Trinity back in Neo's life. That's it. There's nothing more to say. There's some impressive scenes here and there with the fight scenes. But nothing new from the previous movies. This is one of those movies you'll watch but won't watch again for a real long time as it's nothing special. Some things should be left alone, this is one of those times.",5
4985,"I liked that they have come up with some original ideas regarding the storyline and a cool ""new"" camera technique that I am especially greateful was not spoiled in the trailer.Great cast and acting, there is no doubt. Great comebacks and good twists.It also tries to recall some of the feeling of the original movies, but reshooting some parts from the previous movies left a binary (hehe) feeling inside me. They were creating this ""new"" movie. So why was there a need to reshoot these parts from the olds? Proving how cool these were ? We already knew that. Proving that they can still do it? This made no sense.It did make a fine reboot though. Especially compared to how star wars reboot sucked, I think we should appreciate how they tried to do their best. Some parts were great, some were ok and some left the viewer thinking, and again some were a bit strange. It lined up with the original storyline which I think wasn't an easy job given the complexity. And that is what mattered for me the most.",9

4989,"Poor acting from almost everyone, Keanu too. Poor directing. Poor score. Poor production. I'm disappointed really, because I expected more interesting story. And I still after 20 years think there should be only ONE matrix, the first. Everything after the first movie is only worst than the previous one. The first matrix had all, story, acting, produced well. Everything after that is only a meh.",4
4990,People who keep saying it was trash clearly have the attention span and critical thinking skills of a flea. They just didn't understand it. Lol people don't understand symbolism at all nor did they pay attention to the first 3 and it shows by these reviews. Stuck on the matrix and content with being there. Just like the movie said. There's no hope for humanity. Movie was most def good. People just don't like to think lol.,9
4991,"I read many Matrix Resurrections reviews and quite honestly it got me sad. However, when I went in I knew this wasn't going to be the same matrix movie. It is different and for some it might be too complex to comprehend. This had a great story, new characters and old. They really put thought into this film bringing the nostalgia as well as the anticipation of the future. Must watch without disractions if possible.",9
4992,Overall the hype train of the Matrix died a long time ago but can we all be real here. Within the first 15 minutes of the film I thought I accidentally went onto Youtube and started watching a fan made film of the Matrix.,1
4993,"No story, only a few good sequences, lousy soundtrack, no energy, and a complete rip off. Sorry Neo, but this is a bunch of convoluted junk. There are some interesting effects, but it can't make up for putting you to sleep only 20 minutes in. Had to keep returning to it just to make sure I could finish it.",2
4994,"The movie is more about Anderson finding his trinity than finding Neo. So the movie doesn't actually involve deep philosophy as its predecessor but rather is a love story.Would have preferred if this was made into a OTT series, then the sequel if in works made into a movie.",7
4995,"Story was entertaining, nothing special. Fight Choreography was average at best. Doesn't even come close to the original trilogy. Character development is overall weak. There are some cool scenes that make the movie fun. Overall I was disappointed, but that's me. Matrix is one of my favorite movie trilogy of all time.",4
4996,Simply put I dont get why everyone say its bad movie. As a fan of matrix for me movie is amazing and all explanation what is happening is mind blowing. Yet there is one truth in reviews lack of fighting choreograph from previous episode is truly visible and in conparison those fights sucks.,8
4997,"Actually I am a big fan of sci-fi movies and still the number one movie of all time in my opinion is the first matrix movie with no competitor, resurrections is a piece of art..actually the first one and half hours of it but the ending was a little horrible like after freeing trinity, scenes looked like resident evil or some sort of living dead, I was going to rate it as 9/10 but was really horrible when comparing to the first trilogy even resolutions ending was better when sati asked the oracle if we will see neo again.",6
4998,I feel like this was made for people that never watched the original 3. It pretty much tells the story of Neo and what he did then along with a few new characters. Lame.,4
4999,"Well, after all, this prove that the matrix needs both Wachowski brothers to make it.I loved the trilogy so much because it was the fruit of a challenge to the brothers...sis! Dunno?!They best them self in the first one, wide their imagination in the second, and take a nap in the third. But still, the matrix was possible from 2.But this, M4?!, it's just one kid playing with toys all alone, and trying so hard to prove that he doesn't need other kids. It's just sad, and wrong in the eyes of the fans.",5
5000,"I'd agree with some on here that the 1st 30-40 minutes of the film meanders around a bit before you get 'it' however I feel that the director was trying to convey the confusion / disarray felt by Thomas / NeoAs the machines have effectively tied his mind in knots and you discover the story at the same time as the characters and it all becomes clearso stick with it, it all comes good in the end and whilst not as good as the 1st film its better than the 2nd and 3rd films and very enjoyable.",9
5001,"But it wasn't bad. For those of us who watched all of the prequels, Anamatrix AND played all of the games, to me, it was pretty good. I liked the idea that everyone thought that everything that happened before was a game. Some of the new characters were a nice surprise too.... LIke Deja Vu.But I wasn't pleased with the ending.... I'll just leave it at that.",7
5002,"I saw the Matrix in the cinema when I was 10 or so. Since then I've seen it once or twice. That was a great, revolutionary, mindbending movie. It set the standard very high, so if something is going to beat that, it's not going to be its third sequel. Don't have those expectations when watching Resurrections, rather watch it as a movie of its own, then it is really a lot of fun for the most part.",7
5003,"None of Matrix elements were present in this movie. No dark theme. No deep and complex story. Previous Matrixes introduced many programming concepts like backdoor, grabage collector, AI, bugs and many other things but this one had nothing new to represent. CGI was the worst thing i've ever seen!! Its 2021 and yet movies from 2003 have better fight scenes. I didn't even understand what happend to the oracle which was one of the most important roles.",4
5004,"The plot and the characters are so cheesy and superficial, it does not take a genius to understand that this is a simulation. There is no threat from Matrix anymore. The architect has retired and hired managers to run the simulation, Io's doors are protected by holograms, and Morpheus is a bored agent, who does not even manage to put together 2 full sentences. I do not even want to talk about the Agent Smith.This movie has the creativity of a the Fast &amp; Furious sequel.",4
5005,"I just don´t have words. I always loved the first Matrix movie (still do) because of its epicness, thought Reloaded was good and Revolutions disappointing. But this....this is a new level of bad. It´s beyond dreadful. It never felt like a Matrix movie. More like a parody of one. I really have no clue why it was made. The plot is way too forced and the characters are laughable. I understand that they couldn´t bring Hugo Weaving back for his role as Agent Smith but this Smith was a totally different one, he didn´t talk like him, he didn´t behave like him, no ""Mr Anderson"" but ""Tom"" (???). Too many auto-references to the previous Matrix movies, what for? I guess this movie can´t just be independent by itself. At the ending, it is strongly implied that there will be more movies, well, I won´t bother wasting my money on more stuff like this. I felt betrayed. This is not Matrix at all. I give it 3 stars just for of the acting of Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss. Super-super-duper let down of a movie.",3
5006,Ignore critics if you can. Just looking at titles they really have not seen the trilogy. Enjoy the movie! I will definitely go watch all four in one go.,10
5007,"You can have the right bloodline, that doesn't make you a great director; you can have a great writer, that doesn't mean you have a great script. This movie didn't have a great director nor a good scenario and surely not a good screenwriter. Better watch the first one agian. Im out.",6
5008,"Was skeptic to watch it because of all the reviews, but what the hell, I don't care what anyone says, this was highly enjoyable, being a huge Matrix fan, it was cool seeing what happened after the original trilogy.",8
5009,"I still don't know if I watched anything from The Matrix or Sense8.This is the puzzle: Perhaps the new Matrix is a training program that normalized clusters, sharing minds, new powers and abilities of old personae.Find out who is the actual architect of our darker and blueish ages.",6
5010,"I am here and people gave it a 6 and rated it low IMHO, I loved the nostalgia and the references to the first film. I did like the smart changes in the way they managed this new Matrix. I thought Neo &amp; Trinity characters were thoughtful and I understood the choices made here. Did it have the original flair of the first and best film (other 2 sequels were ok to disappointing), no but that is an impossible hurdle to obtain.Overall I liked the movie and it put a smile on my face during the Christmas holiday. If you have the right expectations it's like a welcomed visit from an old friend!!",9
5011,"A Great Movie with a great storyline &amp; plot ... perhaps there's some drawbacks like some Cinematography Glitches &amp; Unability to combine slowmotion scenes with normal speed scenes in from 1:30:00 to 1:40:00 ... another drawback is the lack of physical fitness of both Keanu Reeves &amp; Carrie Anne Moss ... also in some scenes theme tracks seem to be inconvenient ... &amp; lastly ... like all late Hollywood movies ... cramming &amp; pushing for leftwing political correctness of LGBT viewsin the finale which has no conveniecy nor relation with movie events ... As Usual the don't care about other societies live on the otherside of the world that have different values , views , traditions &amp; believes &amp; cramming views like that without occasion harasses them &amp; reminding them of Nazi practicesBut Overall ... the movie is alright &amp; quite interesting ... &amp; despite these drawbacks it still had a solid plot &amp; strong storyline &amp; inspiring imagination ... added by decent action scenes (may be is not perfect ... but decent &amp; passable) ... &amp; IMDB low rating is really unfair &amp; Unjustifiable.",8
5012,"It's not like the original, a sequel is what it is. The love story is beautiful and the general story of the 60 years until IO. I just thought that Mr Smith and Morpheus were a bit confusing characters...Keanu and Carrie have a great chemistry on set. Matrix 5 is on the way. Money dictates...and then news versions of the mateix when Lana is 80 years old 🤣🤣",8

5014,"People are oppressed, again, and locked in their meaningless lives.The main hero (Neo) is on the mission to save his princes (Trinity). Memetic structures are clear.Family is the oppression unit created by the Matrix to extract more energy out of Trinity by making her life miserable. Oppression needs to be replaced with ""the rainbows in the skies"".It is all about re-building the world again and getting second chance.The second change is defined very clearly: to get away from another oppressive element of Binery. Binery is a computer game that Neo is trying to build. Programming the Bibery game is his Sisyphus job the metaphor for capitalist oppression.Those that disagree have only once chance of escaping the Matrix ""lockdown"", by jumping out of the window and killing Trinity and Neo with their own bodies.Kind regards,Bipolar Penguin and my pronounce are... no one cares.",3
5015,"Seems like a there is an extreme effort to look inclusive, but by building complex quimeras with all the cliches known, a quarter of the movie is about bad jokes, another quarter is scenes taken from the previous movies, they make the incognito dress code from Matrix 1 into a braggart code, by some reason Morpheus is now super fabolous; Bugs has the silliest glasses and seem that they had a nice afternoon at a target picking theirs; Smith is now a narcissist and an attention beger, and the new architect reflected through a psychologist, went from poor to not even relevant at all; what is all this fuss about sentients... smith was conscious, the merovingian was sentient, the whole machine revolution was a bout machines become sentient and conscious and overpowering the human race, how now having digital pets like cybebe are the expression of sentients... maybe independants... anyway, i guess one can watch Matrix 1, See the beautiful work made on Animatrix, and just forget about everything else, this goes in the podium along with Batman and Robin from 1997 and Venom let there be carnage; matrix on the third place though celebrating like the bronze medal meme, look at their twitter account they are convinced they made the movie from the decade.",2
5016,"This film had none of the fantastic Noir of the first film.The Dark starkness of Sin City's comicscapes have given way to plastic wrapped motorway food.A sanitised reimagining full of over obvious clumsy and all to clean deja vu of the first film.Not that it was all bad, it does have some good ideas, good moments and will probably spark a sequel.",5
5017,"I went in to this movie with some hesitation. I put some thought into why and I think it's good depending on your expectations and considerations.If you expect something as mind-blowing as the 1st movie you will be disappointed. If you, on the other hand, go in hoping for a continuation of the story I think you'll enjoy it a lot.It's not possible to reinvent the wheel but you can certainly make it better. For me the movie scratched an itch I've been having since... well, the Matrix. I think that, had the Matrix 2 and 3 been condensed into 1 movie, then this should have been nr 3. It ties a lot together that was left untied by the prequels and hope this sets it up for 2 more movies.",9
5018,"Being able to see Neo and Trinity again in the Matrix universe, and know what happened after the events of Matrix Revolutions is priceless.All the new lore that it adds to the universe, the new characters and the new villain, I have loved it and I recommend it to any fan of the previous ones, and even to people who have never seen the previous films.The movie is literally a matrix universe theme park, made for fans......But it is not made for everyone, it requires going with an open mind to be able to enjoy it, and of course it could disappoint those who were simply looking for ""more of the same"", or Neo dealing bullet-time punches left and right.Besides, the social criticism of Hollywood, society and the prequels, sequels and movie sagas is masterful, and knows how to laugh at itself.Very good.",8
5019,"I'm not sure why this movie has such a poor reviews. Action is great, ageing Keanu still hot AF. People this days really hate their lives if complaining about love story. There was always love story in Matrix so why wouldn't they continue. Great movie to watch on big screen as full of special effects. And if you were raised on Matrix movies this reboot is a real treat.",10
5020,You rebooted a holy grail and made a mess of it. You haven't learned anything with the fiasco of Marvel movies lately. Please do not politicize movies and sports. The reason I gave 5 stars is the references made to the original movies which is still THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE.,5
5021,"Although reviews on this have been polarising (it's either great or terrible), I felt this version paid homage to the trilogy, and the use of past Matrix movie scenes really made a lot of sense. Overall, an enjoyable flick, and I enjoyed the starting sequence and technical mumbo jumbo, which made a lot of sense. The occasional mirror images flashing in and out for the 2 lead actors were brilliant, I felt.A satisfying conclusion to the entire Matrix franchise, overall. Highly recommended.",9
5022,"After watching the film it felt like whoever thought making Sharknado was a good idea must have sat through this script and decided that this was going to be a good idea too. Should have taken a cue from the Dark Knight series.The trilogy had a purpose, and it was purpose that connected them, purpose that pulled them together, that guided, drove and defined those movies, and it was purpose that bound them together.This movie sadly had no purpose being a part of the Matrix. Its failure was inevitable and I think the cast and crew knew it as well.",5
5023,I wish there was no matrix 2-3 and 4 ( by far the worst) It is really disappointing to see such movies after the first Matrix in 1999 which is one of the most cult movies in cinematography history. Making such movies just to make more cash by relying on the Matrix brand is also ruining the first movie's reputation.,6
5024,"So the movie is not as good as the first one.....I'd say it's about as good as the second one but better than then the third. You need to think a little when scrolling through the ratings....is it likely that it's a 2? Or a 3? I mean realistically how bad does it have to be, to be below 5?Any score below five is basically an internet troll unhappy about his or her life and bitching on everything else....Next You need to think how likely it is to be 8....or a 9 or above.....also unlikely since it's part 4.....that leaves it to be somewhere between 5 and 7....the main characters and the action scenes even with the most basic of stories elevates it at least to a 6.....that leaves us with 6 or 7....taking into account the flashbacks and references into the first parts that elevates it to 7 IMHO so 7 is my scoring....Go watch the movie and don't expect to much and you will have a nice evening with a few laughs, surprises and memories of better days in the past....and ignore the haters.",7
5025,"Genre:Romance, action, fantasy.Plot:Neo doesn't know what is real, seems delusional and is reveiving therapy help. Unplugged ones find Morpheous, Morpheous finds Neo, Neo finds Trinity. All of them have some struggles on the way. At the end, ""The One's"" power is revealed as the connection between Neo and Trinity togehter.Characters:Neo: Added value. Keanu plays good. I love Neo's confusion. He is weak - without the full set of The One's powers, which has been ok for me until half of the movie, later on he seemed a bit too weak according to the other characters, especially Trinity and Smith.Trinity: Medium added value. I like seeing Carrie in her role, but not enough screentime. What has bothered me a bit is how she is instantly more self aware and powerful than Neo.Morpheus &amp; Smith &amp; Merovingian: No added value. Totally unnecessary characters. We do not get Laurence and Hugo here reprising their roles. The story could do just the same without them, perhaps even better for true Matrix die hard fans.Bugs: Added value. Nice new interesting character.Machines: No added value. Introduction of cartoonish based machines that help people... just silly.Critique:If you did not watch the Matrix triology or you did, but you're not a die hard fan, do not watch the movie.If you did and you are, watch it just to get the last puzzle in you Matrix World, however do not expect being pleasently surprised.Of all the plot possibilities and fan theories, the plot could do a lot better. I appreciate Neo's confusion, Keanu really delivers here, also machines / programs convincing him being a Matrix Game designer somehow works for me and contributes to his messed up head. But film being based mostly on a love story and ""The One's"" atrributes being a love connection between Neo and Trinity is not ok with me. And that Trinity is also The One, in this movie even more powerful than Neo, is the biggest fail for me. I get the reflection of the world that we live in now being transmitted to the screen, but for me its just like Lois Lane would become Super-Man or Joker would become Batman - it doesn't work for me. I miss Laurence and Hugo in Morpheus and Smith roles respectively and a better story for these characters in the movie.Genre wise this has been (right after Trinity being The One revelation) the second biggest disappointment. The original Matrix had sci fi, action, drama and some romance in it, all backed up with some interesting philosophy. Ressurection is more like a fantasy, romance, and some action family movie behind with no philosophy what so ever, at least the ones that sticks with a viewer.Overall, I am not disappointed, however not because of movie being good, but because of really lowering my expectations of what the movie will actually be.Seeing it 2 times in a row just to do the review justice, I will rewatch it, however in 3 years, not sooner. I will most definetly watch the original triology at least 2 times in between.Giving the movie a of 10.",5
5026,"I was very excited for this movie. Big fan of the franchise. Saw it still in december 2021. One of the few times I decided to leave the house to be in a room full of people in the middle of the pandemic. Big hopes.I left the movies the same way as everybody that saw the film: thinking if I enjoyed it or not. ""Maybe I have to see it more times"", I thought.After second thoughts, I believe it is a good movie, because it is cohesive. I'll explain in topics:1. Neo and Trinity are old. So, in a real world, one could not expect they would fight and make the same moves than before. They don't know, but they have experience with the Matrix. So, when fighting, they can be, like, economic in moves.2. This is an upgraded version of the Matrix. Thats's why the overall colour is much near the ""real world"" colour. Fights are much closer to respect the laws of real fisics now (Neo and Trinity are now old). Machines are always improving, so the Matrix looks more and more like the real world. In contrast, humans are also improving their hacking techniques, so now they can enter and leave through mirrors (finally explain how Neo ""got out"" in the first movie, not through a telephone).3. The machines changing sides thing is a brilliant aspect of the movie, but poorly explored. Brilliant because it resolves the duality problem from the first movie (humans changing sides, but not machines). And it introduces a world where machines are intelligent by themselves, not a single individual conscience guiding all the others. This is much more ""realistic"" in the world of technology. Poorly explained, though. What could have caused this change? Remember in Reloaded that Smith got ""inside"" a human's mind? That could have been one cause. IA evolution, maybe. Maybe when studying the human body and mind, some machines could have been able to identify and connect with the human motivations. This had a vast filosophical space to fill in the movie.4. The ""new"" architect (psychiatrist) figure is a great change! First, because machines understood that the Matrix should feed human minds, not human fisical aspects (like confort, food, etc). Second, because he is no longer the most important carachter inside the Matrix. There are ""others"" giving the cards this time. He is just a puppet. Room for new movies?5. The ""Neo and Trinity"" duality to rule the new Matrix could have been the way of upgrading the Matrix to a renewed version, like it was before, but without some consequences. Matrix makes the ""anomally"" happen. It forces the machines to reboot it, probably causing a lot of human deaths (minds that do not readjust). Maybe the machines want them to find themselves and discover their ""habilities"" and share the power of the anomally. The actions are the same as in the first movie. Moves, fights, are a lot similar to what happeded before, God nows how many times. They think they opted for being together. But in fact they did not. It's the machines controlling everything.I gave 7/10 as it is not perfect, and I'll explain why:A. It is a fan made movie. It is not for everybody. Someone that did not see the hole trilogy will not understand a thing. That should have been warned with care in the trailers.B. If the humans made a way to make the atmosphere work again, with lightning option and growing plants, why wouldn't the machines had made the same, therefore not needing humans again to power themselves? Doesn't make any sense.Those are my thoughts. Hope you like them.",7
5027,"This movie is the best Matrix since 1999. It reveals just how influential Lana was to the original Matrix trilogy and how this is her story. People want to critique the story, but I guarantee those people couldn't explain the story of the originals. They just see red pill, blue pill. Lana has crafted a fantastic rebirth to the continue the Matrix story. This movie isn't about trying to one up or take away from the original trilogy. It's about how the hell do you continue the Matrix and give fans more of that great philosophical theme. I think Matrix Resurrections is the only answer to the story. The Matrix trilogy has always been a love story at its core. Neo the one, whose soul's goal is to save humanity has only one person he will throw that away for and that is Trinity. The truth is Neo is only the one because of Trinity. She was the one who awoke him and gave him the belief he is the one in the Matrix. So those critics who want to hate on the fact that Trinity now has Neo's powers need to realize they don't even understand the story of the Matrix and shouldn't criticize till they understand what story is being told. Now onto the other good parts of the movie. The acting and dialogue. Dialogue is fantastic with all the fourth wall breaking referring to the originals. It was the perfect choice for a rebirth. Lana completely crushed with her portrayal of life outside of the Matrix with the machines working with mankind. Lo was the perfect idea to replace Zion. It allows so much possibility with future movies. Yayha Abdul Mateen did a perfect fusion of Morpheus and Agent Smith. Many people were disappointed about Lawrence Fishburne not returning but this choice was the perfect one without his return. It allows a young actor to give his portrayal of a titular character, that at the same time breaths fresh life into the character. Bugs was also another fantastic choice because she filled the true role of Morpheus perfectly. I do have a few criticisms of the movie and that is how the action scenes were shot. I am not a cinematographer so I don't know the technical terms but I summarize it as they were filmed like a 90s movie with 2020 techniques. It makes me wonder if Lily was more of the director of the scenes while Lana created the storyboard, because the action scenes lack that original Matrix flare. They were the only part that was a miss on this resurrection. Overall, I think it is a great continuity of the Matrix universe and truly excited for more films.",8
5028,"There are things this one did better than the original lore wise just like there are thing the original will always do better than this or the original sequels...My generation and the one before has to get used to the idea that not everything is meant for us... there will never be a Matrix movie or trilogy that means to us what the original meant to us... they captured lightning in a bottle and defined a generation... so of you go into this expecting that, you're going to come out feeling like that BS IGN score....this is this generation's matrix... the generation that doesnt know about point break,or bill and Ted or speed... all they know is John Wick so let this be for them, let this introduce them to Neo and Trinity and the world the wachowski made 20 years ago, throughly enjoyed 8 out of 10.",8
5029,"This movie is NOT flawless. And it is not a full 10/10 movie either. Let's be real. This movie had no business being made. ""It wasn't planned or orchestrated. It was just something that needed to happen for me to grieve"" -Lana W.So even by the director's own admission the movie wasn't supposed to happen at all. And it shows in the acting and script. There were several ""wait what??"" moments in this film. And not like ""whoa, makes you think"" kinda moment. I mean like ""why is this happening? Huh oh we're done with this scene now? Oh okay."" This movie is too slow in the beginning. It takes waay too long to get going. They could only get a handful of actors back probably because the rest thought the script was lacking or felt the movie wasn't necessary. The whole thing with Morpheus is just confusing and ham-fisted. I also believe Fishburne was asked to reprise his role and turned the script down, the only reason he wouldn't have been approached is if there was bad blood on the set of the last films. And anyone who believes Lawrence Fishburne was not approached is either a child or incredibly naive, just like the same people who rated this movie a 10/10. Pretty sure almost all 4K of them are bots/children or friends of Lana W.Lord, I hope this is the end of the matrix once and for all. I'm sure this review will be hate bombed by the masses but w/e I never post on here anyways. That being said I will say some nice things. Some of the plot aspects are cool and well thought out but I really thought they were going to take it with Neo taking over as 'the architect' and recreating the world as he wants. With him becoming the bad guy and ruling the world around him. Which is pretty common trope used in a lot of movies today, so I was surprised to see they didn't take it in that direction. Would this movie have been any better with the original actors reprising their roles? Maybe alittle bit but not much more. Again, this movie didn't need to happen. It only happened because the director wanted it to so she could grieve.",4
5030,"***Major spoiler***The only reason it didn't get a 10 from me is because I felt it could've used an extra 10-15 minutes on just Trinity's matrix life or at least a bit more of a struggle of her trying to get out of her shell. Overall, I loved it. Loved how everything before this movie was cannon and it wasn't a reboot. It tied everything up.I also wish they would've explained how all of a sudden thirty is the one. Or another one rather. Was she always? Is that what they're implying?",9
5031,"The movie was kinda pointless. Keanu and Trinity were too old and didn't have the same amount of training they did for the other movies, and it showed. The action scenes were dark and blurry. My main criticism is the movie is ugly. It's hard to look at most of the time. I did like that it was a small plot. It wasn't about the war between the machines. It was only about why Neo and Trinity were resurrected and the power their bond has, but damn was the movie ugly. Oh and the score was really bad.The reviews about Trinity being the one are BS. They're both The One, or The Duo, or Couple or whatever. They're both important.",6
5032,"Why? Just why make a sequel about a classic movie series with a closed ending. Totally unnecessary. And if you choose to make one, try make it less complicated. Just a mess.",
5033,"I would rank this 4th place out of the 4 Matrix movies. Worth watching but it really doesn't compare to the others. I didn't like what was done with Morpheus. I didn't like what was done with the Architect. Special effects went downhill after over 15 years? Yikes. Story was OK nothing truly deep. I did like the way the Matrix world became aware of itself but it wasn't developed enough as anything more than a sidenote. Good fight scenes saved this flick but all in all it just feels like a reboot and that bores me. Didn't Reeves just do this with Bill &amp; Ted? Killed the franchise with a reboot..of all things, right? Maybe he just wants to retire at the top soon, which is fine. But damn these latest Reeves flicks SUUUUUUCK.",5
5034,"In an effort to make the sequel appear more realistic and modern, I fear the matrix resurrection has lost touch with the very fun extremities and child like wonders that made it's predecessors such a hit , I sincerely expected so much more from a sequel to what I considered the best sci-fi movie of all time but all and all am glad to see kaenu still has that magnetism in his role as neo and I would also applaud the visuals on the production ..",7
5035,"Just mediocre in every way, it's not bad by any means but it was just not interesting. Maybe if it was shorter it would have been okay but I almost tapped out before it was over.",6
5036,"Great expectations is what I had for the film. However as some of you know if you keep your expectations low you will never be disappointed, but this is no way to live...or even watch a film.The movie itself was a bit slow to get going and quite convoluted but I hope they work out the kinks and give us another 2 sequels to make another trilogy.I recommend watching it and forming your own opinions as they're some absolutely scathing reviews on here which the movie doesn't deserve.",7
5037,"The Matrix Resurrections does an adequate job of explaining HOW it exists as a sequel to the trilogy, yet it doesn't really justify WHY it exists. It's good to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss back in their respective roles, although the rest of the cast (and some of the action scenes) are fairly forgettable. This sequel also has the same pretentious tone the other sequels have. None of them are as great as our first trip into The Matrix.",6
5038,"Now. I may be biased here having very recently completed watching the original three movies. So I may be having a soft spot for wanting to see more of the Neo and Trinity story.First, the great stuff. This movie does so well with the visual and sound effects, watched it in the cinema in 4K and Dolby Atmos and wow 10/10 for purely the entertainment aspect that comes from every fight scene, explosion and other cool effects. Honestly, very well done and feels true to the Matrix style of unique action.The good but not so good stuff. The storyline actually makes a lot of sense and can complement the original story really well. I'm not going to give out too much detail but the flashbacks and even the elder Sati character were very well done. I didn't even mind NPH's character.But.. this brings me to the pretty bad stuff. The reintroduction of characters like Smith, Morpheus and the Frenchman all feel way too far fetched from the original characters and how their stories were. All these characters had great depth and were originally written with seriousness and each had their own flair and unique style. But this movie just tries to cheapen that by giving these characters all stale jokes and terrible lines or making them look plain stupid (how they dress, act, talk etc). Like what really got on my nerves was how many times lame jokes and puns would just have to be mentioned in any scene. Totally took away the depth these amazing characters had from the original movies.Some may argue saying they're not meant to be like the original characters because, well, this is a completely new and overhauled Matrix. But I still say, there were way too many terribly written moments made to sound funny but they were just not and felt out of place with the whole movie. The worst parts were when Neo tried to crack jokes (the attempt to fly moment + the final scene with Trinity).The fact that they tried to make a very profound movie more entertaining through a poorly written sense of humour was the biggest disappointment for me. If I wanted to watch a comedy movie I wouldn't be looking for it from the Matrix.Overall, there's a lot to love and I definitely think there's some great stuff here but does it stand on the ranks of the original trio? Mmmm not quite, maybe closer to Matrix 3 but nowhere near the first and second. Is it worth the watch? Hell yeah, it's still very entertaining and even if you can't bear to go through with a new Matrix storyline watch it for the audio and visual effects! So that's my 6/10.",6
5039,"The screenplay, casting, CGI and direction were on point but the plot lacked substance. The movie starts off with intrigue and originality, then follows the familiar path of recent sequels (remember Star Wars) to a predictable, happy ending with plenty of fan service.The resurrected versions of Morpheus and Agent Smith are definitely the highlights of the movie. Neil Patrick Harris does a great job as the Analyst but he lacks the ambition or raw menace of the original Agent Smith by Hugo Weaving.Overall I would recommend watching this movie once, to see what happened after the war (that part was great writing) and to enjoy the reunion of Neo and Trinity but this could have been so much more !!",8
5040,"First fight between Neo and Smith was ridiculously bad and everything just went downhill from that point.Thought the story had potential to begin with but it was poorly executed and then turned into a heist movie with no tension to back it up.Bad casting, poor character development and disappointing performances pretty much all round.Special effects were shockingly bad compared to original trilogy.Stupid and obvious ""twist"" at the end and that post credit scene pretty much sums up how seriously they took this film.Like others have mentioned- it's trying to convince fans it is a good movie by throwing nostalgia at you every chance they get and it just doesn't work at all- total cash grab.",3
5041,"Still didn't learn anything about the movie or what the Matrix is even though it's the 4th movie, The thought of 'what is the Matrix and what is behind it' is what keeps the excitement of the movie. Hope to God they plan on revealing it in the future or my review would be much lower. This movie is hard to follow off the bat, it was very De Ja Vu. After going through all the information, I found the plot. The protagonist is actor Keanu Reeves (10/10 performance) is playing the main character portraying a much older version of the old one. The plot was rescuing someone, it wasn't about the Matrix, this is why the movie is getting low ratings I presume aside from its title being sucked from all the money its able to produce. I gave it high ratings because they did a great job with the plot they were using, though, if the plot were about the Matrix I would say otherwise. It almost felt like the new movie was a side movie and had no relevance to any new ones. Mr. Anderson is a classic antagonist, they messed up bringing him back, especially in a different body, and above all that making him lenient to other characters. Morpheus was completely sucked of any good qualities or characteristics he used to have when they practically made him president and changed his personality. The way that the movie played off was about the same as the first. It was different because it was more laid back, (less serious), more challenging, and a more diverse plot. It started up building tension with Neo slowly going insane and depressed, the Matrix had such a big influence on him that it almost made him think it wasn't real. The Matrix took a different approach. Neo who had become a video game designer making games off what he experienced in the pass made him famous. We find out eventually that his boss was Mr. Anderson the whole time and had been articulating him into doing so, this was the best plot twist. The new main antagonist was many times more powerful than the last, able to stop time (manipulate the Matrix), bring a bigger horde, and manipulate the entire Matrix, posing a much bigger threat and challenge than the previous 3 movies. Comparing the new main antagonist to Mr. Anderson, it seemed like he was a much higher rank therefore more powerful which makes us wonder who he is and creates excitement to learn about the ranks and who is at the top. The pressure is set for the finale of the franchise. He was able to strip Mr. Anderson of his powers which might anger many old fans, but to me was a display of the new power. And makes us wonder what he is capable of. This movie would have got 10 stars from me if it wasn't for the old fans being angered, you can never do that to good fans.",9
5042,"I wanted to like it, but then I started watching it. About 35 minutes in I was surfing the web shopping for cast iron cookware. Then realized that a movie was on and I should probably watch that instead. 10 minutes later I was buying some really nice cast iron pans. I can't wait to cook steak and eggs in them. Oh wait, this is a movie review, isn't it?Seriously, fire the editor. And rehearse more. A lot more. WTF Keanu, you are better than this! NPH wasn't bad, but smith was terrible and unnecessary. Jada was as convincing as an old person as was Halle Berry was in Cloud Atlas (those old bones), which isn't saying much. Not to mention, who did the sound editing? During the 'epic' zombie fight scene the sound editor forgot include music and meaningful sound for a couple of minutes. Then Keanu can't fly, but at the end he can? Up, up and away!Sorry for the spoilers, but then if you read these first you had it coming. I liked Neo better as a dead man.",2
5043,"Makes matrix revolutions look like Hollywood and this b movie, what a bizarre bad movieIt's a disposable movie in itself to earn money, the characters you take out the neo and the trinity (which barely appears in the movie) the rest is all disposable, if it had the name of Jeremiah, Maria, José, whatever... action , there isn't, the action scenes are rubbish, from a B movie, the neo like the neo of the other 3 forgets, this one only knows how to give that bizarre ""hadouken"" when he misses the trinitybesides, they gave neo a strawberry to eat in the movie HAHAHAHA they took botany to the matrix, why not in shortWHAT A BEAUTIFUL GARBAGE.",1
5044,"I truly enjoy all of the Matrix movies equally because of the fact that the characters and story blend together so well. I think that Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss did a fantastic job with this one and although it sucked not to have Laurence Fishbourne and Hugo Weaving in this cast, the supporting actors played their part and did a fine job. This movie still gives you that action-packed feel of a movie that we are so used to seeing. A little slow to get going but picks up halfway through for a strong finish. Solid movie. Would watch it again. 7/10.",7

5046,"I think I had too many theories and expectations going into this film. The actual film was tamer than I imagined, but once I got past that it was pretty great.I thought maybe this film would flip the franchise on its head, or maybe that this was actually the 7th NEO?Turns out it's same old neo stuck in the matrix again. So it's a reboot. Definitely better than what force awakens tried to do. But I wish there was something new, some new concept to really mess with our minds. But then I remembered the first matrix and how reloaded really expanded on the lore. Perhaps a sequel will make this film better.I think this film is worth a watch, not as mind blowing as I wanted, but is a cool retake of the first film. My theory is Trinity is the One in this new Matrix, though I just wish she was in the film more, and had more dialogue and more of a breaking out moment and build up.Also my only gripe is, where is Hugo Weaving? He was my fav in the original trilogy.",8
5047,"So the thing that this ends in it's particular way, not only they have destroyed the whole story, and managed to make everything not worse than bad, but idiotically disgusting, I will erase this somehow from my mind, and remember the first 3 parts of a marvelous movie which was something special for me.... I should've known this is going to happen.",1

5049,Nothing of importance was added.The action was sub par.A mediocre story in a mediocre movie.Both Keanu and Carrie deserved better.Trying to make money of a beloved franchise and doing a very weak effort to add anything story or entertainment wise.,5

5051,"No idea why, but the bizarre rationale of resurrections undisputably worked for me and let me say it: it was worth doing it.Can anyone here seriously argue that making a back to the future 4 could have beaten the making of this matrix sequel? I doubt it. Just like with back to the future, matrix trilogy looked hermetically closed and over. Nobody had the guts to make a sequel of back to the future III to this day. But Lana had it (although she was a he before) and did it . Does anyone seriously believe it is easy to reopen what is smart and hermetically closed ? Good luck for that. But this is a challenge Washowsky won and she deserves much respect for that. So yeah, thank you lana. Reeves and Moss are brilliant, other actors not too much, but still enjoyed my self. I smell failure when i watch a sequel but this definitely not one. No betrayal, make yourself at ease you will get more than enough for your money.",8
5052,Not sure what all these other reviews are about! It's a good film. Other reviews clearly written by people stuck in the past and can't deal with a modern film.,10
5053,"I knew not to go in with too high expectations given the current state of movie making. The trailer certainly looked promising. I was even OK with it looking very different from previous movies (use of natural light). But here's the thing, it feels more like a made for Netflix Matrix-inspired movie than a proper Matrix film. There was nothing I can say stood out for me; nothing memorable to look forward to even if the movie as a whole wasn't that good. The 1st Matrix is flawless. A classic. The 2nd one had the highway chase, burly brawl scene, the Merovingian.. it was entertaining. Even Revolutions with the war in Zion, the giant robots.. again entertaining. This one, feels empty; like they ran out of ideas and they were telling you the only reason it got made was because a giant studio simply wanted them too. I almost walked out during the first 30 minutes. Why recreate the entire 1st scene from the first Matrix? I remember thinking oh no, what have they done to this franchise. It's not all bad, that would be unfair to say. I liked the idea of the city of Io and how humans &amp; machines are working together, the machine civil war, how they can hack mirrors, Buds character, the Analyst's explanation of how they came back to life, how he tried manipulate Neo into plugging back in, all of Sati's scenes. It certainly had material to make it a memorable film. But it feels half baked, like they had lost interest in giving this film the special something that makes a Matrix movie a Matrix movie. Feels like a missed opportunity. Worth seeing? Yes. But don't expect that Matrix magic to be in this installment. Is good to see Keanu &amp; Carrie-Ann back on the screen, their chemistry is one of the few good things about this movie.",7
5054,I was always surprise how and when they make a new story and release a 4th part of Matrix. But I was really surprised after releasing the new part of Matrix series.It was really outstanding work by team.Great work..I love to wait for Matrix 5.,9
5055,"I DON'T undestand all the whining in these reviews, seriously.. This is a solid sequel, much more entertaining than the previous two. Of course, nothing beats the original first movie - no need to make that comparison.... Just enjoy the movie, folks!",9
5056,"I must admit, before going to the cinema to watch this film I was put off by all the bad reviews I was seeing. But once I watched the film I was no where near as disappointed to the level the majority of people are. I think it was clever of them to make the first 3 matrix films be to an advanced game in Neo's mind so he is again in the same dilemma he faced from the first film of not knowing the difference between reality and the matrix. The inclusion of certain characters like Trinity, Niobe and Morpheus made the movie somewhat enjoyable to watch. Even though I wasn't impressed by Neo's force field power being milked near the end, it was still a decent film that wasn't boring to watch. Did they have to bring this movie out? No, but the way the third matrix ended did allow another movie to be made on the future. I hope they make another one as there are still some unanswered questions about the reason behind Neo and Trinity being resurrected by the machines. I think certain aspects of the film such as the costumes the characters would wear could've been improved as this was a huge/aesthetically pleasing element in the classic matrix trilogy.",7
5057,"I was a fan of the first Matrix and enjoyed the sequels and the prequel Animatrix). The series probably should have stopped at the first (minus the cheese fly away end scene) but seeing as how they didn't I had to watch this one. My impression is, while it is a Matrix movie, it didn't seem to know what to make of itself. They played heavily on nostalgia, and were at some points in the movie parodying themselves. It wasn't obvious if it was meant to be funny or not. The reliance on nostalgia to fill in the gaps didn't really pan out. The cameo for the Merovingian seemed like an after thought. There was little exploration into the lore which would have really helped. I can say Neil Patrick Harris played well however his dialogue would have been more in line with agent Smith's lines from the original.The movie was ok, but just ok. I think a new viewer could enjoy it, but a fan of the originals will likely be disappointed.",6
5058,"Just as the title is resurrection, it is a great rebuild/new beginning of the franchise. Very entertaining in it's own right and connects to the orginals in a good way. Look forward to the future!",8
5059,"The movie at first seems to forward you into some interesting history, but spins proofs it's nothing but a revival of Matrix good old days, showing no big reason for Neo's actions and neither it's consequences. In the end, nothing changes for the human history, the one Neo ""died"" to give a chance in Matrix 3.",5
5060,"That's it, i'm sorry but it's true. If you ever loved the first Matrix do your self a favour and stay away from this one. Or if you want to cringe every two minutes be my guest. It's like a bad copy that keeps remindind you the previous movies often with absolutely NO REASON!I can't, i just can't.",3
5061,Just to much recapping on everything. I think most people re-watch the series before watching it Also felt like they're trying to reach a younger audience maybe?Hope the series can have a brighter future to come. Also think it was a mistake not to bring back the original Morpheus.,5
5062,"Gave it a 2 out of 10, only because of the original matrix inserts ... the rest of it was just a big pile of steaming hot poo.The acting was awful , the whole tone of the movie was wrong , and the story line was all mumbo jumbo. A lot of taking and not enough action ... and the action we had was stale and already done so many times over in the previous movies . But hey, at least they managed to fit in all the colour and gender diversities and some good old women's empowerment at the end .The original matrix is still my favourite movie of all time and I really enjoyed the two sequels (even better when you watch them all together )Matrix 4 is the anomaly... bland , directionless garbage . Don't waste your money ...",2
5063,"He says, ""this turns into a Disney movie!"" LOL. Cannot agree more. Or like another Marvel sequel for us-used-to-be-fan-now-tired.I believe I had more than 150 characters.",5
5064,I don't know how I feel after seeing the movie... Too much dialogue... Too much plagiarism on the past movies... They must do other movies to regain my passion and love for the franchise...,5
5065,"Honestly It was great to see another blockbuster from Watchowski but they literally slaughtered all the aspects of freedom by that ending 😒 annoyed to see them flying in the sky like that also using a Nostalgia as the key to the heart . It is not a"" Matrix movie"" it's a fragment of Watchowski 's return . I wish they'd remake ""Cloud atlas "" than having this poor choice of senario ,casts and even visual effects .As a person who watched most of Watchowski's movies I couldn't find any one worse than this however I know it is far better than Marvel and DC over-rated nonsense and I liked some ideas and taste of martial arts and action parts but in the end they put us through an unnecessary sets of events where it ends to nowhere while they invited us to watch a memorable-life-changing classic being humiliated by their own creators.",6
5066,"I'll be short and to the point. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss barely save this movie. I feel like made the idea of this being a sequel a joke, and actually pointed it out in the film. The third act of the film is probably the best part, and if you are a die hard Matrix fan then I'd watch it at least once. Be warned it's not what you'd expect, and you might get upset.",6
5067,"It was like re-watching the first one, but worse and less exciting. If you want to avoid any deeper analysis and spoiler, please skip from this point to the last two paragraphs.As one reviewer indicated, they showed a lot of clips from the original movie, which were scenes from a matrix video game that Neo allegedly designed. They try to cloak reminding viewers of the old story by bringing these clips in, and I agree with one reviewer that it's unnecessary. It treats us as if we never seen the three other films. And it doesn't do that when it probably should, as in the case of the exiles and Merovingian. His role was buffoonish at best and he leaves the scene as if it were theater practice and the director was like ""end scene.""I don't appreciate the dialogue poking fun of the movie as a sequel, etc. It's an excuse to diminish bad decisions, plots, graphics, and more. It means, they're not taking this seriously and feels like just a run for money. The casting is pretty bad. The new Morpheus portrayal is relatively non-serious, unlike the original. Neil Patrick Harris is too much of a jokey guy to replace the architect and is probably a woke casting. They explain character portrayal differences as a result of a matrix purge in making a new matrix. I get the character differences, but also feel it's dumb how they did it. It just diverts too much away from things. Yes, this is a new Morpheus and maybe shouldn't be entirely like the old, but they do it in a way as if they mock the old. Not saying that's their full intent, but it just feels that way. Partially when coupled with dialogue about poking fun at sequels.There's a lot that needs explaining that they just don't remotely attempt to explain. The Morpheus part makes no sense as he's part agent and suddenly wakens by seeing the matrix code. But agents always know there's a matrix. So was he not an agent and became one? What's the story there? Also, the agent Smith thing makes no sense as his code was destroyed in the original, resulting in Neo's death. Yet, he's back (wish actual agent smith was back). I guess it could make sense since the equation always needs to balanced, but this movie is not balanced.I was wondering how they would bring back Neo/Trinity in all this. While it makes sense in a way, it just doesn't hit right. The source of Neo's power was never previously described as being one with Trinity. In fact, Neo saved Zion in the end without her. She was never remotely on his level, yet now, she's practically the One, which is just one element of wokeness permeating the movie. I get it with Trinity, and see no reason why her character can't increase, but it's just so poorly thought out and executed. Her dilemma of choosing to be free or not, seems to come to a climax out of nothing when she chooses to be free. It's like she chose it, because they needed to for the movie's sake.Lastly, if I recall correctly, Neo sacrificed himself so Zion would be saved and made a decision that would indeed keep the matrix intact. Recall the architect convo, that everything comes to head resulting in the One, who is an anomalous result of the matrix equation balancing itself. The prior ""Ones"" chose to save Zion by basically being a new Adam (painting a Bible Genesis picture here), which resulted in a new matrix being built wherein people would slowly become freed. However, Neo sacrificed himself to save ALL of Zion and the matrix would remain and DID remain, persisting as it was, but was again balanced. Though, it's clear the matrix was rebuilt without the facilitation of the One, all within 60 years of Neo's actions. If I recall, the matrix was rebuilt as a result of a machine war due to people being free to leave the matrix as a result of Neo's actions, creating scarcity of energy amongst Machines. In this, somehow, without a One, a new matrix was constructed.However, this new matrix is clearly deficient in ways the architect originally tried to avoid. So not sure why it went backwards, other than two things: keeping people tied to the matrix equals energy for machines; and allegedly, keeping them severely blue pulled (almost an analogy to today) also equals more energy output per human. However, for Machines to be cognizant of issues with previous matrix attempts, it seems illogical from a programming/AI perspective to go backwards by creating a matrix where no one wanted to leave. The first matrix was designed as ""perfect,"" but failed as a result of not accommodating/allowing choice, which seems to be the case here. This can only be explained by the original architect being no more, and a buffoon, Neil Patrick Harris, being the new architect. However, again, I thought machines were smarter than this.The original matrix movies were logical, good and slow at explaining major events, coupled with emotional and intense action that were graphically captivating. This movie is geared towards not taking itself seriously, so why should we? It's glosses over details and doesn't explain things well. The action was weak. It tries to remind us of the first movies as if to remind us, when it feels like they're the ones needing a reminder. The first ones were so logically and philosophically rich, while this just leaves you with more questions than answers.That being said, I do see value in parts of the plot. I think there is room to grow and like a conclusion to this series. I hope there can be room where the human race can overcome machines once again. Though, I doubt that's the direction here. Nevertheless, I see why they did some things, but just don't believe a lot was the correct decision. I am invested in seeing an outcome and just hope they finish what they started. My advice to them, slow it down, don't go woke and go broke. Take the time to make something deep, meaningful, and logical. Take the time to explain things. Take time to do things. Just take your time.For others, if you love the matrix, it's still worth the watch so I don't want to crap all over it. However, be prepared that it won't be as good for now, but make room for it to be better and more complete in the future. I have faith that their minds will make something more consistent with the old movies, but time will tell. Just hope their estrogen pills aren't ruining those unique minds that gave us the first movies. If it is, they should de-transition like I did.",6
5068,"I knew that this movie could be a trap but I trusted keanu and hoped for the best . I honestly believe that the actors put alot into it and really wanted this to work out . I was saying to myself during the movie that despite the fact that it is not really good they tried to make something good. But when you reach 70 % of the movie its pure garbage .Action Scene : They are short and bad and as soon as it start to be decent it just stop.Soundtrack : There is no music that help the flow or increase the intensity of the action scene ... per example in the matrix reloaded ... the highway scene would not be as good whithout the music. They tried to do a pathetic version of linkin park at the end of the movie ..empowering women : Ship commander is now a female , Zion commander is now a female and Trinity is now stronger than Neo . They even taken out Morpheus from the real world and replaced him with a machine . Dont get me wrong there is some movies that I love where the lead character is a female but forcing it just piss me off .I would not recommend anyone that loved the matrix trilogy to see that movie it will just add to your list of movies that should not be touched .Hope this help ,cheers,",6

5072,Where was the originality and creativity?? It was very entertaining but the story line just was well thought out and no spiritual connection. Poor Keanu must have been tired because he had a hard time kicking ass...Carrie was awesome...and whats up with Morpheus....where is the original Morpheus??? A lot of action but dull story line...it looks like there will be a sequel and hopefully better planned out and some collective creative heads coming up with a better film sequel next time.....,6
5073,"I liked very much the connection between old and new matrix. I didn't like Morpheus, the actor was great but the New Morpheus is too funny for this situation.Neo was too low but i wait to see him doing great things at the next movies.Trinity is cool, hot, great.",9
5074,"Watched on HBO and the whole family stopped watching before it finished. Just feels off and like something is missing, thin. Real shame as the trailer was amazing.",4
5075,"It's hard to follow up on a cult classic film that went from cool sci-fi idea to society altering meta ideas realized; Just look at the two original sequals to the 1999 perfection that is The Matrix. The first sequel was good, but so far off the originals impact that it felt flat. The Third movie was a great looking spectacle, but had none of the spark that made the original so loved.-Going into this movie with much trepidation, I came out very happy. The story brings back the disturbing feeling of not being sure exactly what's going on, combined with great visuals. This two and a half hour peak into the universe of Neo and Trinity will certainly require multiple viewings to truly appreciate, and that may be one of its biggest problems.-In order to appreciate this movie, I feel that you are going to need to have a firm grasp on the original, and it would really help if you watched The Animatrix as well. There's more than enough here to keep anyone entertained and engaged, however there is a lot that clearly benefits from an in depth understanding of the entire world.-Overall this movie is far better than it should have been. Its not perfect, and has a few shifts in tone that were a bit off-putting. Overall though we got a movie that, while certain to have its critics, takes the Silver medal in this franchises theatrical history.",8
5076,"I was definitely not disappointed! I literally watched it back to back twice in a row! I liked the story, the Matrix video game, how Neo &amp; Smith are still connected &amp; definitely how badass Neo &amp; Trinity are when they get together. More films, please!",10

And missing old Morpheus.. shame...",8
5078,"I really can't understand why this movie is so underrated. Yes: it's not the Matrix as we knew it, but it was clear this wont be as the first trilogy.I really liked the details and the way the movie was build, but some aspects are made a bit to *we must be funny* instead of implement it in a serious way to have something to move on with the maybe next movie.In my opinion it's a solid start of a new era, with some droped chances, but i'm looking forward for the Matrix Universe and hope there will be a next part picking up the pieces Part 4 left on the floor.",7
5079,"So, the new blockbuster under the famous franchise ""the Matrix"" has arrived.Why the original Matrix was so successful? No doubt, it is due to its innovative idea: our world - as we know it - is an illusion, a virtual reality and the real world is destroyed and people turned into batteries. It was this idea that captured the imagination of millions of people all over the world and made up the success of the Matrix.There were, of course, new special effects - bullet time and other stuff, a brilliant performance by Keanu Reeves and other actors, which added greatly to the success, but the main thing, of course, was that idea.It is precisely this new and profound idea that the last Matrix - Resurrection - does not have.",7
5080,"I loved the addition to the story arch, and the score is beautiful. It's an incredibly horny meta sci fi opera. Of course it will have it's detractors (lest we recall Matrix is really a cult series) and I did raise an eyebrow right at the end where things felt a little insufferably woke but comapred to the rest of the offering of an expansion to the Matrix lore it was bomb.",9
5081,"Went into Matrix resurrections expecting a cash grab and for the first third felt that this was exactly what we were getting, mainly flashbacks of literally the same scenes either played from the first film or badly rehashed mixed in with some pretty atrocious acting from keanu to be honest. I switched off about 20 minutes in and that's never a good sign in a cinema. But then, the second part begins, Neo wakes up and they go to IO, which is basically a new Zion but this time created by machines and humans. The relationship between all the characters from the original films is expanded on, agent Smith returns and theres some good action scenes and shonky 'meta' philosophy that we come to expect from the Matrix and the effects and acting all step up a level. The Io and machine scenes are quite impressive. It's a shame the first quarter is so face palmingingly awful, I feel ratings would be higher if the film had been more consistent but personally I did enjoy this installment a lot more overall than I was expecting and I'm actualy hoping for more.",6
5082,Nothing excited about this one. Poorly made and executed after 20+ years. I appreciate the writers creating a moment that shows the results after the end of the world and that Trinity &amp; Neo are both alive but it was poorly executed.,2
5083,"I watched it because I felt I needed to given I am such a big fan of the original trilogy. But I dont know where to start with why it was so poor. The reason the machines brought Neo and Trinity back to life is extremely loose, unclear or just not very well thought out. The bad humour relating to the first movie. Just bizarre that Trinity now has powers equal to Neo, I get it the male protagonist had all the powers and feminists might not be happy with that, but Trinity had less power than Morpheus in the films and to just say ""oh shes now super powerful"" with no explanation other than a link or bond with Neo... she had that in all of the movies Trinity knew Neo was the one because of love at first sight, but it didnt make her super powerful. Agent smith was awful, not where near evil enough almost a joke act, needed to be an older more hate filled character, actually aging smith would have been a good idea from the movie point of view smith would have hated aging as he hated almost every part of the ""human experience"".I honestly just need to ignore this movie exists. I thought Neo dying on the third movie was symbolic and a fitting end, appearing to die in the shape of a cross as a martyr. Even this film diminishes that because Zion still ultimately was destroyed. So it takes the shine off the victory of the third movie.",4
5084,"Neither the film nor my review.Actually I did sleep through 20 mins towards the end which I am grateful for.The notion of the matrix reinventing Neo as the game developer of the first 3 matrices and the 4th game coinciding with the movie itself,I I thought was clever and made me smile.NPH was the best part for me. Super slowmo and bullet picking was cool. He seemed to bring the most animated acting to the sorry affair.Still overall, underwhelming.",4
5085,🔥🔥🔥 I give it 6.5 out of 10. I live the message in the movie. Due to the fact that I'm now apart of the one percent... well a nobody this movie is only for the people that's woke and ready to make real changes in this world. The change has to happen within you first. Neo was the messenger but the one was always the woman trinity (the name says all trinity 3) the woman has the power to earth because the earth is a woman. Not only that this movie represents unity of man and woman is the most powerful that will change the world... peep the analysis we know who he is and they got on the nerds too 😂😂😂 the nerds made the movie funny. This movie also represented the ones that was woke when the first trilogy came out. They was going up again the US corporation but got tired and went to to sleep so this is about the new generation and they are not taking any rules from people that want to remain comfortable. This movie went over everyone head in the comments. I hope this get you to understand you are in the matrix and you are fooling yourself thinking doing the same program of voting and working and letting the government make changes for you will change things. You are at war within yourselves as an agent smith and the analysts that doesn't want you to break the program to govern yourself.,6
5086,"I had to write somewhere the things I had in my mind after watching this movie. I went to see it, trying hard to take off my fanboy expectations and feelings back from the original movies. The thing is: it's a lazy movie. It's not brave, quite the opposite.This movie brings out themes quite explored in our daily social networks and bar conversations, such as our dependancy on stories brought by the entertainment industry, how we give our emotions and our necessities for free to the ones that slave us, how the creators and artists are prisioned by a system that demands from then to deliver what the market wants and at the same time they do not feel free to create what they want, etc. Bringing deep discutions is not the problem.The real problem is when you obviously try to shield your movie from criticism with this metalanguage and social analysis, and purposedly delivers a lazy history and uninspired action with an anti-climax ending. This film was emotionless. In my opinion, all that made Matrix good in the first one, and all that makes most of the movies that good, is the balance between the message to be delivered, the history and its characters, and the execution. This movie throws away the last 2, being just a criticism that could be written in a letter driven to the 'stupid' fans and the 'evil' executives by Lana Wachowski.In my opinion, only breaking expectations to deliver a strong critical message does not worth the price of a theater ticket, we have access of tons of it in the internet for free. We also have lots of movies that are able to balance execution, history and themes in a perfect way, and using the mythology, budget and history from a movie like Matrix to only give a teenager message to the public and executives from industry is almost criminal, presumptuous and lazy.",5
5087,"It was not such a bad movie, but I was disappointed. Perhaps this is somewhat sadistic, but I feel it's because of the lack of death and decent bad guys.In Matrix 1, Apoc, Switch and Dozer were betrayed and killed by Cypher. In Matrix Reloaded, the key maker was killed by Smith agents and the sentinel bomb killed the Vigilant crew attempting to take down a back up city power station. In Matrix Revolutions, many lead characters die in the bloody battle against the machines.Perhaps in the Matrix Resurrections, because Io is meant to be a city where real-world humans work with synthients / machines, and the war is over, the movie is trying to portray a setting that is less war-like and dystopian, compared the Matrix trilogy. But, I just think that death is what made the trilogy so good and pushed me to the edge of my seat, as an elementary school kid who should not have been allowed to watch movies like that in the first place and even now. Trinity was freed from the Matrix in Resurrections with no characters dying, the Analyst and Agent Smith couldn't kill any of the members of Bugs' crew. Everything ended almost too happily ever after.This brings me to my second comment. I think Johnathan Groff and Neil Patrick Harris are great actors. However, after watching Groff as a good guy FBI agent in Mindhunter and Harris as Barney the legendary ladies man in How I met your Mother, I did not feel a sense of bad at all from these characters.Agent Smith, the other agents, Merovingian and even the train man and Cypher in the Matrix trilogy all had this sort of sense of bad that I think added to what made the Matrix trilogy interesting to watch. Johnathan Groff and Neil Patrick Harris, at least in my eyes, don't come off as bad at all but were the two main bad guys in the Matrix Resurrections.This movie did not have the sense of thrill that the Matrix trilogy had. The originality of the Matrix trilogy would be difficult to repeat in a movie such as Matrix Resurrections, but I feel that there could be more death and better bad guys.",5
5088,"It's a movie that didn't have to be made, didn't really say or explain anything, where everything had changed and every moment was spoon fed to the characters - filling it with the amount of information of a trilogy, thusly taking out the time for a build up to be made. Missing those beats, at times the music did too - for which without its crescendo, you wouldn't have known it was a scene for a build up moment.I love all the actors, especially the original ones. They are amazing and especially for what they did the first time around in the trilogy. The script fell short with this one. Really flat.And why wouldn't it? It breaks the fourth wall giving the Warner Brothers a big F-U numerous of times - like several times (!), along with criticism of reboots, revisits, remakes and what not. One must wonder if Lana Wachowski really wanted to do this movie to begin with? Lilly didn't.I would have wished for Lana to instead voice her critique, if it was intended as such.I wanted this to be good. I knew that it wasn't going to be, as with all reboots and remakes nowadays. It's a strange time we live in I think, but I think I'll try and forget this one and go watch the original ones, which matters. I loved those.The cast? Thanks for trying. You made it worth watching along with some nice CGI and production value. There are nice moments. It's not terrible, it's just not very good. Unfortunately.I'll stop now. I hate focusing on negative things. Better luck next time,..",5
5089,"Well I just saw the movie, so am writing with simulated data ""see what I did there""I read couple of reviews and there is question mark above my head??Yes it's made to take money, yes it's made on glorified history, etc.Let's go from the start. Back when first Matrix came, it was movie which few people understand, u really needed to free your mind to understand the plot.Then sequels came and just cooped with the storyline, more or less. Ofc movie budged was larger and CGI was the new thing and they used It. (A lot people complained for that) It was a more than a solid trilogy (7 total score for me)DISCLAIMER. THERE CAN'T BE IN TODAY'S TIME MOVIE like THE MATRIX 1999. People back then was more religious and closed minded that movie simply blow their minds and beliefs.Then resurrection.Like a word said it self. It was resurrected and it was fun, I was enjoying seeing a bunch of references on a first movie etc, story line (all movies) was 60% always about Neo/Trinity love, 40% wining war against Machines.They just took the 60% plot from Trilogy and used as main plot for this movie, that was more than ok.Yes movie has a couple of moments when is a bit ""boring"" but take note that, today society is so feed with all kind of fight scenes from all the movies, they can't be so original, LIKE A FIRST MOVIE, stop taking first movie in equation so much and realise, we ENJOYED the Matrix for 2.30 hrs more in our lives.We enjoined Keanu and Moss, a little bit funnier storyline than Trilogy ( people are so depressed now days, that we needed a little bit silly acting)All in all don't look thru the scope of ""The Matrix 1999""U'll be disappointed.Rather look thru the scope of Resurrecting The Matrix with a blast from the past with a touch of today's cinema. And U'll ENJOY the movie. Just like me.Don't deny (low score) the interesting movie just because u expected alot, because MATRIX 1999Give it a solid review and solid score because it deserves.",8
5090,"When I teach or have speaking engagements, I often can analogize many things using parts of the Matrix Trilogy. I have watched all 3 movies over 500x. I loved how the Trilogy ended. The Resurrections is an unnecessary addition. Within 5 minutes of starting, I decided to throw out my love for the Trilogy and watch it as a stand alone movie in order to appreciate it. Otherwise I would have given the movie a 2 criticizing it constantly as I watched. It seems that someone really wanted a female dominated, feminist messaging Matrix movie and decided to make this. I have always defending choice made in the Trilogy for why they made sense in the whole arch of the storyline. Like Star Trek: Next Generation was for Star Trek the original, if the Wachowski's wanted to go in a new direction they should not have made this a 4th installment but 1 of something else. As a movie apart from the other predecessors wasn't bad. I liked that they referenced the ""issues"" of its existence in the movie. Cannot say if they make a sequel, I would need to watch it. Lastly, Trinity was always equally important to the storyline, the moment of my greatest let down in this movie was Neo not being able to fly but Trinity could. We went on a journey for Neo to discover himself, he dies before understanding then evolves. Making him the ""weaker"" partner in this manner at that stage made me think this movie was more about a message of female dominance than a story of partnership. And yes, this is coming from a woman and a huge Matrix fan. Since it does not live up to the brilliance of the originals, I will not refer to it as a Matrix movie just a movie spin-off from the Matrix.",6
5091,"I know the matrix videography quite well, and this chapter did not disappoint !It was fun, nostalgic, referencing to the previous movies just in the right amount ...not so much philosophy this time, butyou should watch if your a fan of the series.",8
5092,"It has bad story writing but the action is what keeps the movie together. During the first half it has the idea of a Matrix film with confusion and questioning stuff, but where it really starts to get bad is the part with the new Zion and having to save Trinity. Another thing that makes this film worse is that Agent Smith is a good guy? I imagine that the idea for Agent Smith was to be a bad guy but apparently not and they brought back Lambert Wilson for some random reason. I just don't get it with the re-casting, sometimes it's always okay to let go of a character which I don't think the director understands.",4
5093,"I sat and rewatched the last tied the initial trilogy. Given the fact these movies were produced 20 years back, I was absolutely amazed of their cinematography, the jaw-dropping fighting scenes and of cource the first Matrix was really a revolutionary film.So, I was really excited to see what 20 years later would bring. Alas, the first half of this movie did not come anywhere close to what the original trology had achieved. It wasn't bad, but there were bad moments. The fighting scenes throughout felt fake or unoriginal, which was a big letdown. I wish the movie had followed the recently released demo ""The Matrix Awakened"" on this respect.Also, there was an intentional recreation of moments of the first movie, which I am not against, but I wish they were more a part of a bigger mind plot. Neo is manipulated by the Analyst's Matrix, but he is equally manipulated by Bugs and Morpheus as they recreate moments from the first movie to ease Neo to their side. When Bugs showed the bunny tattoo, I was cringing.Having said all that, Neil Patrick Harris has an amazing monologue in the middle of the movie, which really made me go ""Yes, this is it! Here we go!"" After that it was good and climaxed into a beautiful ending. I absolutely loved the ending.All in all, it wasn't a ground-breaking movie, but I feel grateful for having these beloved characters come to screen again. And I hope we get to see them again.",7
5094,"Thank you all the crew for this great new chapter. Have heard that the movie is coming out a week ago. Watched it two days ago with my wife and we both loved it.All these people giving it a low score... Like 2-3-4-5-6 out of 10... This just tells me how IMDB score hardly means anything.Indeed, in order to enjoy it - you must watch all 3 parts before it. Else you will hardly make any sense out of Matrix Resurrections.The movie builds up perfectly on the previous series.But this is all I ever would want from this film that came so many years after part 3 and like 22 years(!) after original Matrix came out. It had to be a next chapter, not some other story. And this what this movie is.Like with all parts I will watch this one again at some point since there is no way to get all the small details in one go.Looking forward for part 5.9,5/10 in my book.",9
5095,"Lots of character name drops with none of the substance of those charactersA plot that makes sense for about 60 percent if the movie.Nostalgia checkbox ticked, franchise put in a dumpster fire. Shame.",2
5096,"Kind of got discouraged from watching this movie in theater due to some of the negative reviews I read online and it's a shame, while watching at home I kept waiting for the moment were I'll get bored, or start noticing the negative stuff that I read/heard about when going over the reviews but it was the exact opposite, I was actually entertained, I enjoyed every moment and honestly my only regret was that I didn't get to watch it in a movie theater as I originally planned, not sure why as society we feel the need to find flaws in anything to make our lives miserable, to be honest if you expect the premise to be new it will not be, if you think that a prequel was in order that means you didn't watch the Animatrix, or understood the whole cycle that this universe revolves around. What could they have done to make this film better, honestly I don't know, I enjoyed myself and think that they did a good job revisiting this universe.",9
5097,"Morpheus is given too much emphasis and a varied wardrobe, while Neo remains in a forgettable suit and act like sissy with alzheimerYou're gonna lost count on how many Deja-Vu moments this unoriginal movie contains.Is so dangerous of there that nobody died, and to finish off this diarrhea of a movie, you'll get your final chocolate piece with the ending musicIf you lack a part of your brain you'll try hard to find life lessons in a movie which borrowed a lot of concepts from sci-fi japanese creators and twists them about something else.TO like this thing you definitely must be a person who has plenty of time (has twitter, reddit, and what-not with notifications turn on),",1
5098,"Quite different to the last simulation, this time is harder to know which is which as the hologram alteration shows a different code, anyway is just what expected to happen with Neo and Trinity and a very unexpected allied, the greed for control and power corrupts every ones.The only thing a didn't like was the fight sequences they were too crowded the should have been more open takes less cluttered.I must watch it again several times as you always do with matrix to find more small details that leads you to a better understanding. Great work.",9
5099,"OK I'm not sure why the human race is so incompetent at understanding deeper storylines than they can comprehend. If you are a fan of the Matrix storyline and understand that this is like a Big Brother situation you will understand the concept behind this movie and actually enjoy it. I have been a fan of the Matrix since the first movie and actually work in the realm of IT, so needless to say I understand the underlying concept. Truth be known, this is a better send off for Neo and Trinity than the last movie of the original trilogy. Those who say there is no substance to the movie, obviously do not understand the true meaning.",9
5100,"It sounds like the studio foisted this one on you, it must have been a traumatic experience for you and for us too. Thanks for making it like Birdman and too meta for the lunkheads at the studio to get. Unintentionally significant in what it tries to do which is address the side effects of watching the original Matrix. Kind of a love letter to the original and a compassionate hand to soothe all the fractured people who took it all too seriously.",7
5101,"Much better than Matrix 2 &amp; 3.Both actors delivered.New actors are great.Don't understand some of reciews. People lost interest because all of us have differnet approch to movie after 20 years.It could be better, deeper..Best cover music in Matrix ever.",7
5102,"After seeing this movie, I must admit, that I had some questions. The story itself is not hard to follow. The only downsides this movie had to me , was the fact that the storyline was almost identical to the first movie. And I didnt like the ending. But overall this is a pretty enjoyable movie. The visuals really stood out to me. I didnt get bored or anything. But I must also admit that I understand some of the bad reviews, because I have only seen the first movie. I just wanted to watch a movie that night, and I didnt care wich one. Overall this is a fine movie, but I dont think that it is a great one.",7
5103,The returning actors looked old. The non-returning actors were desperately missed. First act was too slow. No resolution in the end which probably means more sequels.,5
5104,I don't know how to word it but it was very bad. It was almost as if they want to make a bad version of the matrix movies. In that case they did it well.,5
5105,"Well they should have made it sooner... and to be honest I like the movie but it just it only last for a week on my local movie theater didn't get a chance to watch it on big screen, too bad.",10
5106,"Not sure about all the hate for the movie. I think it actually was pretty well done considering it was almost 2 decades since the last offering. I liked it much better than the 3rd installment but wasn't as good as the 2nd. It could have used quite a bit more fighting from Neo, but Reeves is 57 years old. Didn't like some of the fight scenes because they were to close up which looks more chaotic, as far as I''m concerned. I enjoyed the story line and it seemed to make sense as the narrative went along.It was a fun ride for me.",7
5107,"How many have been waiting for this movie. Something grandiose was expected, just incredible! I once again reviewed the trilogy and today I went to the 4th part.The whole movie had a feeling that something was about to start, just about...but it didn't start. I left the cinema with the feeling that I had been deceived.There are practically no battle scenes. And with Neo alone at all. He doesn't do anything. Only stops bullets. Only protection. In this film, he is lost, has no power, for so many years it barely glows.A lot of chatter. The whole movie is la la la. Of course there are wonderful moments, very cool. But this is a drop in the bucket. Only the last 10 minutes of about the film justify the film itself in general, that's what I wanted to see all 2.5 hours.",10
5108,I never leave reviews on IMDB but had to express my disbelief at this obvious and pathetic cash grab. Had to watch the original to erase this mess from memory. Would give it negative stars if I could.,1
5109,"Like I said I wish I had an accident or was mauled by a bear before I decided to watch this foul garbage. I'm a die hard fan of the original and always they would make another set of movies exploring the universe. I even wanted them to bring back neo, trinity and morpheous.. But this garbage is not what I was hoping for or yearning to see. I wish I never saw this worthless pile of human droppings!!",1
5110,"I gave 8 for what deserve 6The movie success in bringing back old memories, but new characters were not good enough, maybe the shadow of the old characters were too big.Some scenes move too fast without explanation, how captain teams get into the cars? New captain teams need more time to show their personalities, their talent. The relationship of Nairobi with the robot was explained too fast. How IO was built? (I need more flashback scene :)) ).I have a compliment for Lana Wachowski when she used old matrix scenes, for some scenes its make me almost cry, its bring me back to my childhood, my teenage, my moment with my brothers and friends.",8
5111,"Today I saw The Matrix Resurrections and it was only the second time I have ever stopped watching and left the cinema early.I watched about 1 hour and 10 minutes, and read the remainder of the plot online.It's often been said that the new Star Wars films were simple unimaginative remakes of the originals that offered next to zero added value. The Matrix Resurrections however takes this notion to a new level.Not only do we get precisely the same plot in the first half, followed by broadly the same struggle and love story in the second, involving exactly the same characters, but bizarrely, it is unashamedly clear and honest about it.The painfully long first act to set up the story's premise, which takes roughly half of the entire movie, is overburdened as it has to justify the movie itself by answering questions such as, ""Didn't the main characters die at the end of Matrix 3?"", ""How did we get from there to here?"", etc.And during this process we are even shown footage of the original Matrix films over and over again.These clips frequently appear as flashbacks, but also in situ on television and projector screens, as if copies of The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded on DVD have been left lying around.So if when you saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens you asked yourself, ""Haven't I seen this movie before?"", just wait until you see this one!The never-ending references to the franchise itself, the re-enactment of original movie scenes, the 'fan chat' between characters remarking upon events and other 'fan favourite' characters like we would as movie viewers... none of it constitutes the subtle art of storytelling, but a crass exercise in nostalgia to build a cheap synergy with the audience.But when characters behave like movie viewers and express thoughts and comments that movie makers think we in the audience might, our role in doing precisely that which is vital to enjoying the story is completely diminished, and we are left being told what to think and how to feel rather than thinking and feeling for ourselves.From a movie making point of view, I think it is arrogant and extremely unclever.And because there isn't really any natural scope to extend the Matrix story in 2021, and because the explanation as to why we are here is so long and nonsensical, we witness another fatal mistake the film makes.Read any basic advice on storytelling and you will be told to 'show, don't tell'. In other words, don't simply assert what is happening, show it in rich subtle detail, and allow the audience to conclude what is happening for themselves and empathize much more with the story.Well, The Matrix Resurrections does nothing of a sort. This boring film subjects us constantly to explanations between characters as to what exactly is happening, how things work and why.Consequently, I couldn't care less about any of the characters, and when any of them are in danger admist the big budget set pieces, I feel absolutely nothing.All in all this is by far the strangest and most pointless film I have ever seen.The reason why I left the cinema early was because a) I was genuinely excited beforehand given The Matrix is one of my favourite films, and b) because I actually felt ripped off.£11 for the cinema ticket, another £10 on expensive popcorn and a drink, plus a couple of quid in petrol to the cinema and back.And for what? To watch a nauseating self-indulgent 'Matrix Fan Club' production? I was under the impression that I would experience a fresh new story in a familiar universe.My advice to anyone reading. Don't bother. Don't get ripped off. And let's not help generate a profit for movie makers who insult our intelligence.",3
5112,"I think meta is a new comedy, just don't overuse it because slapstick doesn't last.The movie is entertaining, a bit of a setback for geeks but maybe just a new way to reintroduce it... like resurrection of something or anything.",7
5113,"The cat controls everything, knew it..Btw , i wait for all the female remake of back to the future , robin hood and other classics made by my devious 90's generation ,attempted to be read by simple minds , weaks, lames and sexist people, in the name of the defense of women, what a trick ,people! Next time i call your mom ""robert"" for equality, dude..",3
5114,"This movie was great! It did what it needed to do, recapping the meta of the original movies with a modern twist, and introducing plenty of new elements to the Matrix universe to create intrigue. More than enough action between crucial characters for a comeback movie.Either a lot of people failed to understand the movie, or their expectations were too far in the direction of wanting flashy action scenes and less substance. The Matrix is a universe of deep substance first and foremost, and having the patience and appreciation for these unfoldings makes the action all the more worthwhile.Definitely not a 4 or a 5, and definitely not black and white enough of a franchise to realistically compare it to the original and revolutionary release of The Matrix in 1999. You can sum up the majority of these negative reviews with ""kids and nostalgia"", well predicted.",7
5115,"Nothing but the immense hate generated online against his movie has forced me to put a review of this film.During the production, the makers kept saying it will be a different movie from the original Matrix movie and its sequals, but i guess the fans wanted the same old matrix formula; kung-fu, guns and blaring score.The real trouble of the movie is its threadbare script. In the first act,the movie tries to make fun of itself and the whole sequel genre , promising a strong self awareness and an engrossing 2nd act but script becomes razor-thin and all of the 2nd and 3rd act of the movie becomes dependent on one single point.Its not as bad as it is being publicized online, but still pretty weak.",6
5116,"Matrix Resurrections is a movie that tries to capitalise on nostalgia, being meta and self referential, but fails to transcend into anything more than nostalgia veiled behind a thin plot.Lines like ""Warner Bros were going to make a sequel with or without us"" and ""This cannot just be a rehash, retread or reboot"" were meant to be jokes, but ended up being a painful prediction of the rest of the film.With a fantastic cast including powerhouse actors like Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Christina Ricci you'd expect so much more than the bland dialogue and plotlines they are given. Nothing feels fresh or new, and no one is given a chance to shine.I'm not sure if this was a bad case of studio interference or from a lead team that had no idea what direction to take this sequel, but the outcome is a bland, repetitive, and in some places a cringeworthy movie that feels like a blatant cash grab to capitalise on the current rise of the nostalgia trend.",3
5117,"I have to say, this was pretty disappointing. Between the myriad of cut scenes back to the original films to the cliche' redo of the same themes/elements, wow exhausting.I don't know whether or not it was because I had recently watched the originals, but this felt like a ""lifetime movies"" version of the Matrix.The cinematography, effects and sound lacked the gravitas of the original and felt cheap, hurried and to some extent thrown together.With so many capable actors in this film, it felt stifling and empty, (and did I mention flashback sequence) I wanted to go watch the originals. You get some Star Wars-esk ""Friendly"" machines too - (yeah) including the proverbial high-five with the operator...I wouldn't pay to see this beyond existing streaming and if you want to simply support Keanu for sentiment sakes - then it is worth viewing but wow. To compare this with what the entire experience of nearly 20 years ago, looked, sounded and felt like - it is a giant step backwards. The originals look like the cutting edge, gripping movie - this looks like Dr. Who.",3
5118,"Like many have said, loved the matrix.This is turd, story line is shocking. Action parts poor with a lack of depth.Only 4 stars over 1 is I lasted the full movie before leaving.I will not watch this movie again. It just sucks.",4
5119,"None of the new characters have enough time or backstory for us to care about them, but they're also not throw away characters - the writers seemed to think we would be too triggered if a single good guy died. In fact, nobody died the entire movie - 100% of the enemies are bots. There aren't even meaningful interactions with agents outside of the ones Neo simulates.The entire thing was just a big callback to what they did in the original trilogy. Lots of allusion and direct rips. All with killer special effects, but no substance. They think they're being meta and hip by acknowledging it, but that doesn't make it better; their horrible post credits scene about ""just needing to elicit an emotional response"" and ""uploading the catrix"" makes it a lot worse.Nothing in the movie has any deeper meaning. There are zero stakes. The new human city isn't at risk. The Matrix isn't at risk. Literally the entire movie is about Neo and Trinity needing to wake up and get out of the Matrix - if they don't, they will continue living, just inside the Matrix.None of Smith's motives were clear. He went from being a very strong and interesting character in the original trilogy to a very weak and aimless character here.Cheapening the power of the One is really detrimental to the film. The Analyst's idea that ""Neo was nothing special by himself, he needed Trinity"" is ridiculous. It's rather as the Architect said ""Neo's attachment to humanity was very intimate."" He was still the One with or without Trinity, and his powers were unique to that position. So the idea that the machines can somehow use Neo and Trinity to enhance power generation of the Matrix by keeping them close is both fundamentally flawed on top of being ridiculous. And then letting Trinity be the one to fly them out of danger at the end just steals everything from Neo.Despite everyone assuring Neo that his fight mattered, it seems that the world is almost identical to where it was at the start of the original Matrix movie. The Matrix is a prison. The humans are hiding in a city to keep back the hostile machines. It doesn't seem like they're freeing many minds. The only difference is that now some machines are on their side - something that's never really explained. This new alliance has yielded the incredible result of.. fruit. Neo's entire fight gave humanity fruit. That's it.The Analyst and the machines seemed incompetent and weak. The machine on machine violence was very interesting and could have been instrumental in explaining the resurgence in war and restoration of the Matrix as a prison - so naturally it was only mentioned once offhand.The world wasn't setup clearly or interestingly in a way to support a story existing within it. There is no substance, no stakes, and no point.Overall it's a huge disappointment. The fact that the Reloaded and Revolutions were better movies that were more coherent and added more substance to the universe is testament to the extreme failure of this move.",3
5120,"This movie was not written well, was not shot well, and was not edited well. I mean, Lana Wachowski basically spends the first 40 minutes admitting she didn't want to even make it. It feels like a spoof. Kills the major philosophy of the originals. On top of that, terrible action scenes.",3
5121,"Better and different from the last 2 versions. Fresh new supporting actors, a story that is well constructed even if we know that the big surprise and astonishement of the first Matrix will never repeat.It's a leading SF flagship and I can understand some frustration, but like Blade Runner recently, wth time and a second look people will give finally give it its true value. Still not understand why some people give it 1 or 2 stars and say they have left after 30 minutes. All ingredients of Matrix are here, an interesting story that follows an already well known pitch and good special effects. The matrix atmosphere is present, if you don't like it, you already know it, just don't watch it beforehand, that last thing you can say is that you have been caught by surprise.",7
5122,"I never thought it would be better than the first Matrix, but of all the movies this one was the worst. The Resurrection unfortunately did not happen. And I just think you guys should have consulted the Oracle first.",5
5123,"I enjoyed this movie's story. The story is brilliant, the way it continues works! The meta jokes are hilarious. No spoilers.The action however, is boring and doesn't feel like The Matrix at all, the fight scenes are full of camera cuts and doesn't feel like a gun-fu movie like The Matrix (or the entire John Wick series) has gotten us use to.That said, I love the sci-fi story, don't go for the action (which feels weird saying for a Matrix movie).",7
5124,"I am a huge fan of the old trilogy and I will still be the first to admit that movie 2 and 3 really has some terrible flaws in terms of pacing and long (looooong) action sequences. I think it's important to not put the trilogy on a pedestal. It has some amazing things but it has flaws. In my opinion this one has less flaws and does a few things just right.To start, I think they honor the old original movie by actually letting us experience ""questioning the matrix"" again through Neos experience and also put references to our own world in this version of the Matrix makes the overlap easy to make again. We get to learn how the ""real world"" has progressed after Neo and Trinity succeeded in their mission and I find it interesting and it has a sort of message to it. I also liked that they closed a couple of logical gaps with the sentient machines.The pacing is good, The music is in parts really good, the action sequences are still there, some rehashing the old ones a bit too much, but overall show more variety and balance more like in the first movie rather than in the sequels.I did feel that there where a few ""light-hearted"" moments that became a bit silly and strayed a bit from the serious base note that rules the atmosphere of the first few films (for example new-morpheus). And I missed some of the complexity of the first films, which in part is because we already know what's going on (as far as we know).I enjoyed watching this, I was entertained and I thought it worked.I myself feel this opens up for a continuation of the story and I would enjoy that.",8
5125,"Fantastic thriller of the great actor. It's a good one, and at the same time, one might wonder if they can do anything when they're in pain, but in today's world, anything is possible, and they'll have everything they need.",9
5126,"I'm a huge fan of the originals and this is..kind of a shameless cash grab, a watchable one but it's pretty obvious that it's WB trying to cash in on the franchise name. My main issue is you can't replace Hugo Weaving, the new smith is just lame and forgettable.",5
5127,"So many years after they destroy a good story.They could have left it alone with almost a perfect rebutation but they decide to kill it with this, furthermore they even add Patrick Harris to it completely destroing any true visions of the matrix story from so far back.This movie kills the Martix and any followers.It is so sad to see Keanu Reeves in this. So wasted.",
5128,"I felt the movie was a too short for such story. It would need an hour so to have better rhythm and to avoid the expositions.Great ideas on the new construct of the matrix, on the usage of bots and modals instead of a matrix algorithm perfection of the main trilogy. It touched some nice concepts on a sociology aspect on today's life.It needed more time on:1. Smith's story that goes against the analysts2. The story of the new human city3. How the interactions btw machines and humans played after the peace of the original trilogy4. Trinity's change of mind at the end5. The exiled programs and purge.",9
5129,"If you consider Matrix Resurrections alone, yes, it is a good entertainment movie, would give 7 out of 10 stars. But, considering the franchise and the story background, with all the philosophy teories and great thoughts about our time and society, this sequel is an huge mistake for all the fans.All the simbolic story was changed to an pseudo-romantic headline, despite all the strategic and reasonable characters. The jokes are so-so, but out of timing in certain moments. The social criticism is gone.Looks like the Wachowski sisters made it against their will just to fullfill Warner and the box office.",5
5130,"I want to like The Matrix Resurrections. Really. I was first intrigued at the concept of the original trilogy being a video game franchise--totally didn't that one coming! But if you're going to bring the characters to life in the real world, they ought to be the same. As much as I wanted to like the new Morpheus and Smith, their performance was below subpar. Cheesy performances do not equate with their respective personalities that were established in the original trilogy.However, even if Fishburne and Weaving had agreed to this, it all goes back to the writing. It sucked. While I praise Lana Wachowski for being more inclusive with the LGBTQ+ community as evident by the supporting cast, she also lost the plot. The campiness and the flamboyance was unnecessary. I enjoyed the serious tone that the trilogy set from the get-go. The action in M4 was absolutely lacking. Neo without guns? Get out. Neo needs guns, and he certainly needed lots of guns to shoot down this abomination. But given the current direction Reeves has been going since the success of John Wick (by the way, Easter egg alert!), Neo, as seen in M4, is no longer allowed to walk through the lobby again and massacre anyone who dares to defy him. He is now limited to just king fu and using the Matrix's version of the Force. Had Reeves done away with the long locks and the beard, this would not have felt like a poor attempt of a crossover in the Keanuverse. We could have probably had the same Neo we all loved once more and perhaps more bullet time sequences--the absolute foundation for M1's success and the core element that was watered down in M4.The only character that I felt had great potential was The Analyst. Very much like the Shakespearean imp Puck or even the iconic Riddler from the Batman franchise, he will toy your brain much like he did Neo's. He is the anti-Smith, and even Smith was just another puppet in this puppet show, which gives the Analyst a greater power over all the characters. He could be the protagonist or the antagonist depending on his current project. He is methodical, controlling, and absolutely, terrifyingly calculating. He is an upgraded version of the Architect. But at the end of the day, he is the perfect mind**** that will surprise you by his performance.I could not get into Bugs or her team. I could not get into the grown-up Sati. And I certainly could not accept Niobe as a bitter, elderly general--a sharp, contrasting depature from the days of M2 and M3. If anything, she should have been written as being more supportive than a roadblock to Neo's personal mission to bring back Trinity.Speaking of, the moment Neo picks the red pill, the tables are turned and we end up on a new path to find the ""New One"" in Trinity. Neo's love for her elevates her to his level so they are now on equal footing. She is not the One as far as the messianic complex goes--that will always be Neo in the original trilogy--but she is the One for him. And that is basically M4 in a nutshell: a love story.While the promos showed promise, I was disappointed instead. Without her sister, Lana Wachowski cannot deliver on her own. This film was not needed. If anything, it was a cash grab to make Reeves relevant again outside of John Wick and keep the Keanusance running.Unfortunately, that engine is still running out of steam, and so is this franchise.",4
5131,"I loved every bit of it! I was fully immersed and engaged throughout. Although I can already see reviews calling it trash lol 😆 Sometimes no matter what you do, you can never please some folk.The fact is that the first Matrix is an iconic movie with revolutionary elements. We all knew that going in. I didn't expect resurrections to be mind bending. I went to see Neo and Trinity again and embrace the nostalgia.I thought it was funny and enjoyed the meta bits. In my opinion, it was well paced. I didn't want to go in and be inundated with action scenes. In addition, Neil Patrick Harris is awesome. He nails everything he does! I especially enjoyed the last 20 minutes. Trinity is such a badass.All in all I had a good time and it was great to be in the Matrix again.",8
5132,"The entire movie felt like it was trying to undo the revolution of the original trilogy. The matrix wanted our heroes to succumb and in the end they did. Something about live long enough become the villain.The underlying message is that, if we paint the matrix with rainbows (get it?) the people will like the pretty colors and will stay in the matrix.",1
5133,"It definitely doesn't beat the first movie, but it's arguably better than any of the other movies that followed it. In recent years, I've become a very cynical movie goer, and I almost refused to see this one as I was worried this franchise, that I loved as since I was a teen, was going to become yet another soulless and bastardized, woke cash grab. I was so refreshed to find the new characters likable, and for the movie to stay true to it's original philosophical essence. Action was never substituted dialogue and visa versa. My only complaint is that they could have done a bit better with the CGI, it seemed like it should have improved a lot more than it did from the early 2000s; but if you don't let that deter you, it will not disappoint. I very much look forward to any future movies as long as Disney never acquires any creative rights.",8
5134,"If you're giving this a bad review it's simply because you just want some action flick that keeps you entertained with mindless violence. However, if you've kept up with and enjoy the plot of the Matrix then you'll love this movie! A great watch and I'll be buying it to finish off my collection when it comes out!",8
5135,"I don't understand all the negative reviews here. For some context: I'm a huge fan of the original Matrix and saw it multiple times. I thought the second and third movies were decent too but lacked the originality and intriguing ideas of the first movie. Resurrections in contract is unlike any other sequel I've ever seen. It proposes some unique ideas and perspectives that are reminiscent of the first movie. Without giving anything away, the first part of the movie takes Neo down the rabbit hole again - self discovery - and it's more trippy, and in some sense more frightening, than the first movie. It also brings up a lot of philosophical, psychological, sociological, and political questions. There are also a lot of metaphors and social commentary in this movie, and I wonder if people were expecting more bullet time and kung fu and that's part of the reason they were disappointed. It also seems very relevant: it provides an interesting social commentary on how much we're plugged into our phones, and the more we get immersed into the world of social media the more we lose our reality. In this new movie the matrix doesn't have that famous green hue; everything looks more real. I'm sure this was intentional and the illusion and the initial confusion feels more real. It also seems like a cautionary tale for metaverse (especially if it's run by Meta!). My only gripe with this movie is that I thought some of the initial ideas in the movie had tremendous potential and they weren't fully realized. The second half feels more mundane in comparison to the first half. And even though the new characters kick serious ass the stunt work doesn't come anywhere close to any of the previous movies (not a big deal for me). Overall, I really liked this movie. The original movie will always remain one of a kind in western cinema, but I personally liked this more than the second and the third movies. I'm probably in minority here though.",7
5136,This boring movie is basically a 120 minutes long apologies to the audience and excuses and begging for forgiveness that they made a mistake by killing Neo and Trinity in the last movie. They had killed the cash cow and now they want them back so here you go.. two hours of blabbers to get you ready for a 5th movie.I hope they never make a 5th one.,4
5137,"It was way better than the reviews on here. Wasn't as good as the original, however not a disappointment by any stretch. If you understand our current situation in our own matrix this was greatly appreciated. Very parallel to what is happening in the world today.",8
5138,"It's not perfect by any means but still enjoyed it. Makes for a great movie night at home, some plot holes but overall enjoyable movie if you're open minded.",7
5139,"Trying to limit spoilers.I've just watched this movie and LOVED it. I prepared myself by watching the first trilogy before heading out as reviews said there was a lot of 'flash backs' and that 'the plot didn't make much sense.'Well it made sense to this fan.Tom Anderson is a famous game designer after creating a trilogy of games called 'The Matrix.' He is also struggling to figure out how, what, where and when he is as things just aren't adding up like they should. A substantial portion of the introduction is Tom trying to figure out why things are so messed up in his life. Why does he still have to go to therapy - after all this time should not he have shown some improvement? He medicates with blue pills and that darned black cat reappears!Then his mate, Jude (think Judas) becomes the unwanted wingman and introduces him to Tiffany at the company coffee shop. It becomes awkward when her husband comes in to drag her and the kids off to something family related.The rest of the movie has a flow-on effect plotline from the past three movies; saving the worlds as we know them and keeping the love of his life - alive.Carrie-Anne Moss once again does a great job in her role. Keanu Reeves - the only person who can play Neo - is again a little boring with monosyllable responses but we've learnt this is part of Tom/Neo's charm. I do love the play on Morpheus (II) since it's a different actor in the role. He does a brilliant job recreating the character much the same as how Oracle is aware of her own changes. RIP Gloria Foster.The action scenes got a bit boring for me as there was a lot of invisible power bumps and a lacking of Matrix-esque improbable moves. Maybe if a little less time was given to the action and more was given to the plot development it would make more sense for those who didn't catch on to the references to the previous movies. Considering what Agent Smith does to Bane, I wasn't impressed with that plot development; just seemed a bit too easy and clean (thus the 9/10 stars).Ultimately, I can't wait to watch it again.",9
5140,"The Matrix trilogy has influenced and shaped my life in more ways than I could acknowledge.This movie will be no exception. I watched it two times already, and just like the previous ones, it gets better and better as I pick more clues, easter eggs, and a better understanding of everything that is going on.The soundtrack is already haunting me, and I'm pretty much listening to it on repeat.The movie is dense with quite a few quotable moments, just like the original Matrix movie. That said, Matrix Resurrections is also very different from the original trilogy, using a lot of nostalgia and prompts from the first movies.It is quite possibly the most politically engaged movie of the four. Resurrections is not shy of saying things just as they are, which does sound surprising at first. Many events from the past films are covered and explained in great detail, which some will find too much dialogue and technicalities, but the avid Matrix fan will feel at home there.Is this an action movie with a lot of special effects? Yes, to some extent, though not as much as the first trilogy. This film is much more than that, which explains the binary reviews I saw here and there.If you're looking for a movie that will make you think, that will make you question whether you should have taken the red pill or the blue pill (if you ever made that choice), or if you even remember which one you took, this is it. Matrix Resurrections is full of great ideas, prompts to make us think and question our own reality, which is really what the initial movie was all about in the first place.Sure, equaling or surpassing The Matrix is an impossible task, and that was not the goal here. The goal was to reunite us with Neo and Trinity while surprising us with an unexpected fourth movie that is quite enjoyable and definitely recommended.",8
5141,The story is amazing but it didn't let it time to progress in a human way. The pacing is off and the characters don't get the development they deserve.The matrix 4 looks like a rushed book Adaption and the book most likely a way better read. They could have easily cut it into 3 movie because it is so rich of twists while not being boring. All in all the movie doesn't give you time to connect to anyone most of the time.,5
5142,"As a Gen-xer who loved the original movie to the point that I tolerated the second and third movies...this new addition was a wonderful return to the original idea with clever dialogue, not too many fight scenes and the excellent addition of Neal Patrick Harris.The only reason I can guess it's currently rated so low is that the majority of the population didn't understand what was going on.Was it perfect? No, but it was quite good.",8
5143,"The story delivers, what should happen after the third movie in a creative and original way. Also, philosophy behind the movie is still strong.How Neo and Trinity are still alive? CheckHow can Matrix imprison Neo with all his powers ? CheckCan there be really peace? CheckHow should Matrix and people world should evolve after what happened? Check (Of course they should change towards its opposite as a synthesis. )How should control mechanism of Matrix evolve in its next iteration?All above was written very logically and also creatively in the most naturally possible course given the real world historical examples.",9
5144,"Its a little tricky but love the actions, I liked the action, the drama, the new concepts, the bullet time reloaded :D. Keanu Reeves is by far my favourite actor!",10
5145,"The kid who spent the whole night chatting with his classmates about future technology and Bible stories grew up, and the shock of seeing the Matrix for the first time disappeared. After twenty years, the technology has become more advanced, yet the concept of the film has not changed, even the brain-computer interface is still the same model, only the program is different. The Wachowski brothers have now become the sisters, and they directly complain about Warner Bros in the film. Though Interstellar, Space Odyssey 2001, Blade Runner 2049 are also very shocking, they cannot compare to the Matrix as a science fiction film enlightenment in terms of the strong impact. But what's interesting is that the creator who created Neo 20 years ago in the movie is now a counselor who tries to control Neo through deep conversation, as if the reality told us that you need to see doctor if something goes wrong with you instead of breaking out of the trap. Someone says he wants to see cyberpunk 2077 remake into a movie, but now y2k are revived, even if the future really become like that, it is desperate to see our future turning into full of haze gray city while everywhere covered with neon lights. Isn't the better life based on high-tech worthy? Compare Naomi trying to grow strawberries in IO with Bugs trying to save Neo and Trinity to start the revolution and change the world, how to use science and technology to re-create the natural vitality and order of the new world than to make the choice to subvert all the re-revolution in the pursuit of justice (or political correctness), what I expect to see in the fourth is how Zion destroys the Matrix and re-create human civilization. However, the result is that Neo and Trinity fall in love again and help Matrix iterate? Insinuating that human civilization cannot escape its own trap. Please, even China tries to remove the tag 'world factory'. The world has been changing and evolving all the time. Warner Brothers should go bankrupt like MGM as in an old story. Don't do money laundry in this way, you are ruining a legend.BTW, here's a quote from Dune, 'I now believe that evolution, or deevolution, never ends short of death. That no society has ever achieved an absolute pinnacle that all humans are not greated equal. In fact, I believe attempts to create some abstract equalisation create a norass in justice that rebound on the equalisers'.",3
5146,"Needs lots of little fixes. Remove some stuff like the flashbacks, add some color grading to keep it more in line with the other 3 movies. It also has some pacing issues, that could be fixed with some retiming combined with visual effects and in one scene it lacked a bit of audio effects. All in all it feels pretty unfinished and too lenghty.",6
5147,"Movie starts out interesting, I liked some of the commentary on movie studios, sequels etc. But movie quickly devolves into soulless mediocrity. Awful fight choreography and action scenes. Jada Pinkett's old woman acting was laughably bad. In the end I really just wasn't invested in anything happening. The rage against the machine cover is an abomination. It honestly seems like Lana was like ""if the studio wants to make another matrix I'm going to do it and I'm going to ruin it myself!"" I think it's worth watching once but I can confidently say I will never watch it again and I won't even consider it canon.",6
5148,"The original Matrix film is considered by many to be one of the best films of the 1990's, even despite the fact that the concept of our reality being a computer simulation was never all that original. What was original were the style, action and music. What better way to make a sexy action film, than to invent a premise where people could battle it out, defying gravity, all the while wearing fetish wear.Eighteen years later, this fourth installment centers on the love between Neo/Thomas and Trinity/Tiffany, their separation from each other while imprisoned in the Matrix, and their eventual escape/reunion. It's a real mixed bag.This is in actuality, a love story. Unfortunately, actors Reeves (Neo) and Moss (Trinity) have never had much romantic chemistry on-screen in any of the Matrix films. Their characters in this film don't yearn for each other. The film hints at a slight recognition between Thomas and Tiffany when they meet and shake hands in the Matrix, but that's all that we're given. Are they willing to die just to try and reconnect? As such, the entire premise of the movie seems flimsy.This movie is quite long at two-and-a-half hours, so it was surprising that little character development of Neo and Tiffany is offered. Thomas Anderson is burnt out at his job, and suffers from seeming hallucinations that unknowingly to him originate in his former life as Neo. Tiffany tolerates her brusque husband, demanding kids, and experiences precognitive dreams of the Matrix as Trinity. Can't Thomas simply change careers and Tiffany get a divorce?The main characters carry very little gravitas as compared to those in the first film and to a lesser extent the other installments. Most of the supporting cast seems to be weak, although Jessica Henwick as Bugs shows some potential. Neil Patrick Harris as The Analyst is pretty good, but it's still difficult to see Doogie Howser as a menacing figure.Neo is removed from his slumber in the pod for no reason other than curiosity, sentiment and nostalgia. Neo endeavors to free Trinity from her pod for reasons of affection and love. There are no other greater reasons for their escape; no greater calling to root for.There is no clear antagonist in the film that presents a mortal danger. The Analyst character is the closest that we get to that. While he threatens that the Matrix will be reset to its former state, you don't really feel that humanity is in peril. After all, those that wished to remain in the Matrix will continue in their slumber, while those that were freed will hide out in the underground catacombs as they are presently doing anyway.Much is made of Neo and Trinity being physically older. It kind of reminds me of Jean Luc in Star Trek Picard and Luke Skywalker in The Last Jedi. Their comrades question if they can be as they once were. However, this makes no logical sense in the film's universe, as actual physical strength and speed meant nothing in the Matrix; strength of mind was the key. Did Morpheus not say in the first film, ""Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles in this place?""You'll probably end up watching film either as a rabid fan of the franchise or for 'completeness' if you're a casual fan. The CGI is good, and there will be times when you sit up in your chair (albeit briefly) when something compelling happens. For example, when the film hints at the war between machines, or when the resurrection of Trinity and Neo are flashed on the screen. But, it's all too brief.The ending is a bit dissatisfying and feeds on some tropes such as the recent zombie phenomenon in movies and TV. The audience surely expected more than just a mob of ""bots"" piling on the good guys, and others jumping out of buildings to try and randomly splatter on the protagonists.Lastly, the movie seems to thumb its nose at its audience. Quotes like ""nothing comforts anxiety like a little nostalgia."", ""they're gonna do it (make a fourth sequel) with or without us"", and ""our sequel franchise spinoff"" (spouted angrily by the Merovingian) leave little mystery as to how the film makers feel about fans of the Matrix.This Matrix ""Lite"" gives closure as to what became of Trinity, Neo, their comrades and the Matrix itself. But, it feels as if the magic is gone and it doesn't break any new ground for the most part. As Agent Smith says, ""You've lost something...""",5
5149,"Right from the get go this film tries hard to relate to the originals by reenacting scenes from the original, but falls flat in doing so. It would have been much better to have written a 100% original opening scene and not rely so heavily on recalling the originals, which only comes off as a blatant ploy at invoking nostalgia.The first half of the movie almost felt like a rehash of Matrix 1, trying to convince Neo to take the red pill. This was not the ""resurrection"" I anticipated. Apparently, the resurrection isn't something we witness in this film, as it already happened in the back story. In fact, from the sound of it, most of the interesting bits already happened in the back story. It gives the sense the Matrix 4 is something that already happened and this is a sort of Matrix 5 spinoff.There is a strong change in tonality from the original 3. The originals were very serious, little to no jokes or humor, all about the cool factor. This, however, was full of attempted humor that was not actually funny and probably irritating to those who take this franchise seriously.Some scenes I still do not know if they were trying to be funny or serious, like the scene near the beginning that showcased the entourage of game developers who worked in Neo's office. Their lines were cringe-worthy and I don't know if it was to be funny or if that's how the script writers envisioned themselves, with these --seemingly stereotypical, but probably exaggerated-- personalities of the modern, millennial game developer. Sad if that's true. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was supposed to be humorous, which, again, deviates from the tone of the originals.The strongest parts of this film, if any, would be the scenes outside the matrix, like on the ships or in the new city, Io. Most of the seasoned actors performed well. I have very few complaints with the performances of Reeves, Moss, or Pinkett-Smith (with what they were sadly given). It is unfortunate their talents were wasted on a weak script and story however.Some of the visual effects were 'okay', but nothing to write home about. A lot of the more intense action scenes felt like they were shot really close-up, with a shaky camera effect, perhaps to make up for a lack of effects elsewhere. Probably the single best visual effect was during the ending motorcycle chase scene which was on par with some of the original trilogy effects, but most other effects fell far short of the originals.The music score was rather disappointing, sounding like most action films from the past 15 years, presenting a mostly generic sounding post-classical affair, typical of what we've been hearing since the Dark Knight and the whole 'dark music' post-classical craze. I think a stronger emphasis on electronic music, like some nice original trance or techno scores would have been much more welcome and fitting with the originals here.My biggest grievance with the film is the overabundance of contrived, fourth-wall-breaking references to the original trilogy, the worst offenders being in the form of literal video scenes from the trilogy itself, put up on screens within this film, as though what we saw as an audience in the original trilogy was a literal reality down to the camera angles. Didn't think it would be possible to break the fourth wall in a Matrix film, but congrats, this has done it.",3
5150,"I was 12 when The Matrix came out. Over the years I've watched the trilogy again and again, discovering nuances and finding a different perspective every time I've revised the series.The 1st film is everyone's favorite. I personally liked all 3. The 2nd film set the necessary context and the 3rd film gave the trilogy and story of Neo a resounding end.To me, The Matrix trilogy transcended time. The world of Neo and the Matrix, however current, existed beyond us. The story of the one could have existed in the ancient times or far into the futures but it wouldn't make a difference except the environment which the story took place.Now fast forward to 2021. 22 years after the release of the original Matrix. 22 years of social and cultural development, me2, covid, Etc... as a result, the 4th film no longer exist outside of the current society we live in. Without revealing too much, the plot of the 4th film isn't half bad. Given how things ended in the original trilogy, I could see the events in the 4th film unfold the way it did. However, this is where the pros end and the cons begin.Given how much flashbacks of the original trilogy was shown, I thought I was watching a remake of the 1st film. The style and the amount of dialogue in this film is very different from the trilogy. Timing is off. Choices of words could've been much better and the jokes are mostly forced. A few iconic characters are getting facelifts. I really don't understand the need for this since a reboot is suppose to introduce new characters and basically go for another run. Neo and Trinity are enough to get people into the theaters, why recast iconic characters and potentially piss off the entire fan base is beyond me.Lastly and most importantly, the 4th film is filled to the brim with social context and self-aware jokes of the ridiculousness of a Matrix reboot. However accurate, it only made the film worse. Now the Matrix and the story of the one are intertwined with the PC culture. Proof: not a single character whose got a name died in this film. Death give stake to a story and this film has none.Reeves and Moss singlehandedly carried this entire film. Without them, the future of the Matrix reboot looks dire than ever.",5
5151,"Apart from a questionable story...You would expect intense and amazing action and martial arts scenes...well. Quite the opposite. All this year's later the martial arts choreographies ARE SOOO BAD. Weak, slow, not impressive at all.They were so much better in the original. At the end of the day..watching this you get a bit pissed and feel kinda betrayed. It would have been better to let the trilogy like it was.",5
5152,"Ok, I finally got to see this after a long period of hesitation (5.7 IMDB rating, really, doesn't seem like something watcheable). Did I regret it? Hell no! I really enjoyed most of the movie. ALRIGHT, SPOILER ALERT. Well, the Matrix can no longer impress us with action scenes for sure. It was a breakthrough back in 1999 but since then so much has happened in the movies (including serial copy-pasting of Matrix special effects lol) that the action seems, well, quite ordinary, not much special. But the plot - I must admit, at a certain point it got me to believe the Matrix could be just imagination of a psychotic game designer. For real. And the whole idea of Neo trying to figure out what's real was quite intense. Altogether throughout the movie most of the time I wasn't sure what would happen next, although I'm a good guesser. Yep, not one of the Matrix 1-2-3 movies, but a really good one. The action isn't great, but the idea and the plot - superb!",8
5153,This is far from the master stroke the original was. A bit like Star Wars trying desperately to add to something that is perfect.Would work as a tv show.,2
5154,"Having seen a splurge of sequels in recent years, the was everything that the Star Wars Rey trilogy wasn't. The was a simple premise, well executed. New Characters were well introduced and the 2.5hrs went quickly.It doesnt nerd out though, it realises that the story is fiction, and for die hard fans that might be a disappointment.",8
5155,"Before viewing this movie, I rewatched The Matrix in IMAX (for the first time in this format since its original release). I was still blown away with the story, special effects and performances. After rewatching the rest of the trilogy @home i thought i would be ready for the Resurrections.I was wrong. I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss still got the parts down. Even the new addition of Jessica Henwick works most of the time and Neil Patrick Harris clearly is having a ball in his role. But some things felt off, moved too fast or were not explained in detail (which i did expect).Nothing will top the first Matrix (Reloaded and Revolutions didn't either) so adjust your expectations. I was glad to spent more time in this Matrix-universe that expanded on the lore, asked new questions but unfortunately didn't quite hit home on all fronts. Still, i would recommend seeing it in cinema.",7
5156,"This is my first review on IMDB despite being a member for more than 10 years. I am from India and viewed the Matrix during my 10+2 days in 1999. Although the sequeals were released in 2003, I viewed them after completing my MA in 2006. As my readings and understanding grew so did my insights into the wonderful esoteric syncretism of the worlds and worldviews of the franchise. I also own the 10 dvd set of the franchise. Much of my academic and esoteric ideas about our reality were shaped by the films. In such a context, I was eagerly waiting for this film and it didn't disappoint me. Lana Wachowski impressed as usual with a lot of ideas from both Psychoanalysis and Analytical Psychology. Many of the ideas from the film's first half are from both literature and Psychoanalysis. Ideas about dreams and reality, the return of the repressed, hauntology and spectrality, Postmodernism and yearning for a faith in faith are all in the film. In all three worlds of the Matrix, Io and Machine city we see strong elements of posthumanism as machines have teemed-up with humans effectively subverting the classic Hegelian master/slave dialectic of Us and Them. The visuals and filters are of our colorful postmodernkitsch world with grand narratives and ideas turned into video games for banal consumption. There is also much nostalgia and parody through some characters such as the Merovingian. Some of the characters like The Analyst and Smith are more like metrosexual hipsters. The film demands multiple viewings to write extensively about its attempts at deconstruction of grand narratives present in the trilogy. Nevertheless, with all its references to our reality and the esoteric traditions of salvational armies from higher worlds the film also manages to stay faithful to the original trilogy. New ideas from science and science fiction make for a visual treat of animated machines and colorful realities. Some of these are the blurring of boundaries between the human and sentient machines, the combination of Neo and Trinity as an opaque ground for the machine world's inability to conceptualize their romantic excess, the abilities of the Io armies to teleport through mirrors as portals and a variety of non-human machines that are hybrids between human consciousness, non-human sentient animals and human/non-human/Posthuman machine bodies. It is a well-made film with both a classic contradictory Postmodernist nod to its predecessors about both accepting and rejecting them at once. Looking forward to write academically about the film in close reading/reference to its predecessors very soon and also newer versions of the franchise in the near future. A lot of original ideas inspired by literature, philosophy and the previous films makes for a promising watch.",10
5157,"I would personally give this a 7.5 but i rounded up because of all the review bombs. People who can't watch more than 30 minutes of a movie leave behind bad reviews when the problem is their mindset.What i didn't like about this movie are the cliche's, what i liked about it is the lack of cliches. It seems like all movies have been forced to follow the same 3 different kind of patterns forever, when a movie tries to break away from that pattern it is seen as a flaw.This movie is at a halfway point between the pattern and outside of it, i think that's why most people would agree that it's a bit off. But i think the fact that the movie contains the title Matrix has served against it, and people are letting their nostalgia ruin things for them, even the reviews saying they aren't letting their nostalgia effect their review. Not just their nostalgia for the matrix, but for the mold of action movies.",8
5158,"I expect nothing and I still let down.. Not as bad as ""harry potter and the half blood prince"" romance but still.....?!! Why would you do that.Conversations and actions are too shallow and contains silence. There is too many questions but no answers. Why trinity has to come back 😂 what did I just watched?",6
5159,"I will keep this very short :The point of this movie, other than cash-grab, is criticizing sequels and recent movies, but doing it in a very tasteless way- no substance, messy plot, horrible action scenes (something that is closer to B movies).Keanu and Anne are great though, other actors are not bad either.Skip this movie, don't waste your time.",3
5160,Better than the original two sequels it's a fun trip back into the world. Not revelutionary by any means it still manages to capture the fun and excitement of a modern action film.,8
5161,"This movie all based on Lana's real feelings on matrix, Actually you need to watch it at least two times to catch conversation details. Relations btwn Neo, Trinity, Therapist and Smith was really good, and at the beginning movie makes us like ""are we watching an illusion of a sick guy?"" ""Was all matrix an illusion, a game?"" There were very good actually, and we see Neo's three shell, but trinity is one! It was also obvious why. Movie made us confused, but it was a good movie, dont vote just because we were waiting a supreme movie, this movie deserves at leat 7!",8
5162,"My 1-star review is not to bring the overall score down, which would be a welcome bonus, but literally because that's what this film deserves. Lana had everything at her fingertips to deliver an empowering message, and instead, she came with an incoherent, uninspiring, discombobulated mess of a story that risks putting the entire trilogy to shame. It has me wondering where the talent of the first movie came from...because Matrix Resurrections reeks more of Jupiter Ascending than anything else. Utterly disappointed to see this opportunity gone to waste. But at the same time, if you consider that this planet resembles the Greek myth of Sisyphus, I guess the failure of Matrix Resurrections should come as no surprise.",1
5163,Second best after the original. It updates for events that are happening currently. Those who low rate this film are as agenda-driven as anyone who enjoyed the original series.,8
5164,"Just like star wars movies. Old movie lovers hated prequels. Everybody wants to see like first movie. But first one is unique and no one be like that. The movie give us neo and trinity back, this what iwant. I liked the movie, flashbacks,story and new charecters.I m greatfull they have a second chance.",8
5165,"Bom, como se era de se esperar, não supera o primeiro filme. Adorei ser uma continuação direta da trilogia anterior e confesso que estava com medo de ser um reboot de fato. Também adorei a forma como brincam com a marca Matrix dentro da própria Matrix e brincam com a Sr.a Warner.O filme é repleto de fã service, o que me deixou alegrinho na sala de cinema. Me segurei pra não gritar quando Neo começou a segurar as balas no ar novamente.O filme tenta ser inteligente como o primeiro foi, e funciona. Mas obviamente fica confuso em algumas partes e algumas outras você simplesmente precisa aceitar que é daquele jeito porque é daquele jeito.Gostei do reconhecimento que deram para a Trinity, merecido inclusive.Em resumo, um excelente filme, mas que não traz nada de inovador como seus antecessores trouxeram.",8
5166,Meh. It's not that good and way too long for the story it does tell. A nice metaphor for us Gen X'ers. Seems consistent with the world for us. Very slow.,4
5167,"I don't know if it's good movie from a neutral observer's point of view, i.e. At it's own merit - very likely not.However, it was was like seeing an old friend after 20 years out of the blue, like being transported to 20 years back. I guess it's the emotions, haha. Well done.",8
5168,"The movie starts off by breaking down the fourth wall, meta-analyzing the hardships of introducing a late-to-the-game sequel. The producers set expectations low from the start and yet still manage to disappoint.Sadly, this is the best part of the movie. If you don't like it 20 minutes in... buckle up, because it only gets worse!The plot is hazy at best, relying heavily on call-backs to previous moments in the series. Iconic scenes are re-framed and re-characterized, weakening their significance. New characters are introduced but are easily forgettable. The producers re-hash and butcher old ideas and fail to introduce anything novel.Newcomers will be totally lost. Die-hard fans will be appalled. Would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1
5169,"Reading some of these reviews on here is quite shocking. I am not sure what some people expected from this film. The first matrix film was untouchable and will never be beaten, however I honestly felt this film played a very respectful homage to the original film, and added some of its own interesting twists.If you go to the cinema expecting to see matrix 1, you will be disappointed. If you go to the cinema looking to see the matrix expanded from its original trilogy with some new ideas thrown in, you will enjoy this.",9
5170,"O. K I was never a real fan of the previous Matrix's but I thought I'd give it a go.Well special effects was realistic, the filming was well done, even the acting was acceptable, but what was it all about?I got totally lost, and I love a good Sci-Fi but nothing made sense to me.",6
5171,"Lana did put a lot of herself in this is my guess. And her love. For this I cannot talk to bad about all this and I respect her as an artist. This is my personal view on all this.Script: Really weak script. Reminds me of netflix movies and series. Seems like this movie is made so you can multitask at the same time? I do not know. The script has flaws troughout the movie:Neo's handler for example has nothing more to say then what a teen talks about to his 19 year old ""bro's"".It goes on troughout the movie: Alot of ""shit"" ""Dude"" ""omg""for no reason really. Alot of things have been simplified and repeated so the ""avarage"" viewer can follow the plot?Very unrespectfull. It seems to be made for my grandma or mother in law who does not understand any movie ever. So the whole family can watch feces flutter of the screen.Cinematography: The same goes for this. Alot of flashbacks and repeated shots so you can ""keep up"". Extremely unrespectfull to the viewer who the creators think they have an attention span of a seven year old.+ The cinematography has been shot and edited in such a way you can watch it on any screen. Phone/laptop and TV.A shame really. This hurts the movie alot. There weren't any legendary shots like in the first three movies. For example where agent Smith and Neo are fighting eachother in the third movie at the end with the insane decors in the background.Effects: The effects remind me of old action movies and bollywood movies with the slo-mo effect -way- overused. This wont stand the test of time.In my opinion this movie will be forgotten or continued as a very mediocre HBO streaming flic. Nothing more. Maybe even a serie.Story: This one is personal and for you to find out.Overall: This movie has alot of potential and is not all bad. But most of it is to hard for me to swallow if you add everything up.",2
5172,"Worthy of a few more watches, and a worthy sequel. Matrix fans will appreciate how this movie resets the series, and redeems the problems created by Revolutions. It only took 20 plus years to circumvent the atrocious narrative of the 3rd film... and I think Lana did a commendable job in doing so. It's great to see reprisals and rehashings of original characters... it's done with taste and stays true to the original series. I hope this is the start of a full reboot, not just a one off venture for the creators of the Matrix. Possibly one of the finest Sci-fi's of the 20th century.",8
5173,"I liked it. It was a little dumbed down for modern audiences, but it made sense and the action as always was great. Also, Keanu still knows Kung Fu.Go see it.",7
5174,The movie is really disappointingPoor casting and actingThe only good thing is the acting skills of Keanu and maybe trinity.The rest is really not good. Overall you're not suffering watching it it's is just that it doesn't rise at any point.,6
5175,"I'm a fan of the Matrix trilogy and had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, it was the worst film I have seen in many years. Their attempt to create a chimera of the original and something fresh was a failure. Wait until you can rent it fit $3.99 on Prime Video if you really have to see it.",4
5176,"One of the most anticipated premieres of this week along with ""Spider-Man"" is ""The Matrix: Resurrection"" - the continuation of the legendary trilogy.I'll say right away - I've never been a fan of Matrices.I only remember the premiere of the very first film. All the other films in the series passed me by, I watched them much later than the release and I remember almost nothing in terms of the plot.Abuse of ""Shrine""; Samopovtorov so much - that sick; Music, unlike the music of the previous parts; translation and terminology of this film is something with something...It is foolish to repeat the content of the ""previous episodes"", because the matrix is not just a cult franchise, this is an era that divided the world of cinema before and after.",8
5177,"""The Matrix Resurrections"" brings back the love story of Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss) and Neo, our two cyber heroes whose romantic connection gave the earlier films a sense of desperation larger than the apocalypse at hand. But here, they do not know each other, even though Thomas' video character Trinity looks a lot like Moss. In this world, she's a customer in a Simulatte coffee shop named Tiffany that he's hesitant to talk to, in particular because she has kids and a husband named Chad (played by Chad Stahelski). Reeves and Moss are both invested in this whimsical arc about fated lovers, but the movie plays too much into this nostalgia as well, relying on our emotions from the past movies to largely care about why they should be together.",6
5178,"Loved the references in this movie and the culmination of events. My friends were like ""are they saying the other movies were just a dream?"" ""No... omg this is brilliant!""Doing the whole iT wAs AlL a DrEaM was reified as a no-no in screenwriting. You just don't do it. So love love love that reference, which also subtly mocks those who went into hating this film before watching it. The acting was awesome, the score was great and it looked visually stunning. The fact that Lana evolved the cinematography for this new set of Matrix films was so refreshing, it feels like a new beginning.I did dislike the assiduous mentioning of ""bullet time"", but the rest of the meta gems were great.Cannot wait to watch it again!",8
5179,"Since this is my first comment on IMDB and it's about Matrix, I must start by saying clearly that the Matrix trilogy is the greatest, more ambitious and more important work produced in the history of cinema. That had to be said because too many people underestimate this saga for they ignore that before badly judging anything first we must understand it. And when we see the importance and beauty of things shown in Matrix, despite the presence of defaults, it becomes impossible to be too hard with this wonderful project. Now let's talk about this new Matrix.It's a respectable effort. They thought of justifying this sequel and they found good arguments to do that. It's done with heart and it's a very good point.I wasn't convinced by the dynamics of certain scenes, the camera angles... it lacked inspiration.But the main default is that Neo doesn't shine. For a sequel like this, after almost 20 years, something new and oustanding should have been conceived for Neo and it's not the case. He does nothing really new here and they (director, producers, screenwriters...) never realized that there was a good opportunity to do something surprising for the confrontation between Neo and the Analyst. The idea of showing a Neo easily accepting losing Trinity and unresistingly accepting being killed is really bad. It has no beauty and it's inconsistent with the strength of the bond that unites him to trinity. That's for me the greatest mistake of the movie.So it was a pleasure to find characters that I adore, it was a great pleasure to see Neo and Trinity both flying and holding hands, it's a great pleasure that they had succeed to prove that it's still relevant to see new Matrix movies but unfortunately the central character, Neo, never shone as he should have.They lacked imagination but it was a real pleasure for me to find what is for me the best project in the history of cinema.",7
5180,"Expectation.When an old movie return with a sequel, most of the time viewers expect the movie will be as good as the old movie, or better. Often a sequel fails to meet the expectation of viewers, especially for a highly rated movie a The Matrix.Then best move is to include the original casts, or at least the main actor &amp; actress. Any sequel movie without the original hero will fail prematurely (eg. Man in black, Speed 2, and a few others.This movie preserve the storyline of the first Matrix successfully. The 2nd and 3rd Matrix were not as good and getting more complicated storyline, plus the 'real' life getting unreal as Neo role started to have superhuman power in Zion.For me, the appearance of Keanu Reeves and Carry Ann is enough to give this sequel a perfect 10.",10
5181,"""""Green, everything you is just green'"" -lauren-2022.They put a green filter when your out of the matrix and a blue filter when your in it. I dont have a problem with this but some people like my sister find it anoying. I also feel that the movie dosent really have a grand objective it's just kind of 'save trinaty'",3
5182,"I had high hopes with the movie being a sequel of the Matrix....it didn't feel like watching a matrix movie...felt like watching some regular sci-fi movie, the story line was too lazy never picked up...not even a single scene had a wow moment....",5
5183,"I slept during try to watching the 4th series. It was not even edited properly. It was ilke a music video which has just poor shining sceenes. I was a little disappointed. Film editing sound made without looking at the cinematographer. I was sad because I couldn't see the comments that are the results of the players' efforts. They deserved better. And we deserved to wait this long. At the beginning of the movie, he could not involve the audience in the subject, and there was a disconnection. As the shooting mistakes continued, I realized that I fell asleep while watching the movie.",3
5184,"The first three were epic. And for some reason they decided to transition the Matrix into something weird and unnatural. Forcing it to be something it wasn't. But hey, it's 2022, where 2+2 is supposed to equal 5...? So crap often gets high praise because of who made it.At first I wasn't sure if Keanu was playing Thomas A. Anderson, or Ted ""Theodore"" Logan.Then, after dragging on for-ev-er, it finally tried to be Matrix, but just flopped.And what a TREAT it was to see Jada Pinkett... (just kidding). Her acting was pretty horrible.On the other hand, Carrie-Ann Moss still looks great!I got this movie free from the library, and I still feel I overpaid to see it.",2
5185,"I was apprehensive to put my trust into another of Hollywood's blunders. However I was pleasantly surprised by the reboot of the matrix. Keanu Reeves is the shiz, baddest mofo ever, been a fan since point break! That being said, they made a movie that is good for the first time in a while. Maybe I have avoided new knowing that new is just a steal on what I grew up on. I had a few thing bother me like the force push(only move)...........but I suppose they had to make it hard for them or there would be nothing to show. Not gunna drone on about effects and that. I think it was a hard sell to start the matrix again and they did it well. Also the Doogie Hauser addition was pretty cool. I hope Hollywood fires up the think tank again and stops pussy footing around new fresh idea's(80/90s was the shiz). Thanks for a great reboot.",9
5186,"The Matrix hasn't been any good since 1999 when the first movie came out, parts two and three each went down Hill but all and all it's a classic trilogy since all three are watchable BUT to come back 20 years later with nonsense like this ? It worth seeing just to see if you believe the reviews as I did I wasn't expecting much just wanted to see where they took the story.",4
5187,"Most disappointing thing I've watched in years.. and I'm a Man Utd fan .Loved the first film and although I didn't care too much for the two sequels , I thought after all these years that this would be a well thought out finale.It was awful. In every department.That is all!!",1
5188,"A variantion of the theme, a new twist, a remix. A deja vu, a novel interpration of a familiar song. A materialization of a remote dream, a play with a new cast. It feels like meeting an old friend, remembering the past, and getting in touch with what is truly important, again. The movie is progressive, it is about transformation, it has humor, but ultimately, it is about love. It adds a new layer to the trilogy, ties things together, and brings new dimension to the world of the Matrix. I enjoyed the movie tremendously, go see it, you will have a blast.",9
5189,"This movie remains me Star Wars, like poetry, This movie is exactly like that, please, if you are a fan of Matrix, you have to respect this movie. Critics always appear, but this movie is about traditions. And by the way, a great part of the cast of Sens8 work here, excellent!!!!",10
5190,"This film did not need to exist. Adding to that, it is less cinematic than the other films, editing is also less good, the dialog is just awful sometimes, there is no tension, nothing leads to the next thing, and there is nothing of substance to take away at the end. I had no expectations after seeing the trailer, so at least I'm not disappointed. Maybe just that it's a shame there was not an effort to create an original story based in this universe, which I find very interesting.",4
5191,...to the director and producer. Most forced sequel ever. This movie didn't continue from the trilogy in any way. The story felt force fitted into the trilogy.,2

O pior é que já vimos filmes contarem essa historinha de maneira mais legal.No fim, foi chato e decepcionante.The fan service is cool, but the story is everything that everyone has seen over and over in many movies. The worst thing is that we've seen movies tell this story in a nicer way.In the end it was boring and disappointing.",5
5193,"Weak storyline. It tried to drag some previous scenes into the movie, but only will remind us they are not as good as the previous Matrix movies. They'd better stop here, coz I won't waste my time to watch next one!",6
5194,"Although it is a reinterpretation of the original premise, it doesn't cease to be a 100% Lana Wachowski's movie with its usual conceptual context (counterpowers, techno-anarchism, biopolitics / transhumanism, etc). In the first half, it makes us wonder about our understanding of the original trilogy with a very Lynchian metatextual premise, with dialogues that are an avenging torpedo to the alt-right waterline and that work because they are solved in a more intelligently comical that pretentious way (more Allen than Nolan).The second part of the movie is the kung-fu movie that the matrix has the right to be, closing the narrative arc with ingredients that, although they are not new (many of them quite predictable tbh), they sound interesting because of the uncomplexed and unapologetic way that they are presented (eg the zombie-like fight vs the purged AIs or the new breed of positivistic machines). It is, in that sense, a very self-referential second half, but in a healthy way: it is a tribute that partly laughs at herself and partly is proud of who she is. And beneath that uncomplicated surface, there is a novel and interesting idea: it turns out that The Matrix was not a trilogy about Neo, but a tetralogy about love, which is substantiated in the real and virtual worlds, beyond any preassigned bodies and realities, as a power above any other.Its most negative points would be, in my opinion, several of the secondary characters, who are either very boring (a former antagonist that is not perverse enough), histrionic but without depth (the therapist-in-chief) or below of what the character deserves (Morpheus, unfortunately). Also, the photography, FX and fight/chase choreographies seem bland, quite mediocre, especially if we take into account that the original trilogy pretty much redefined cinematographic language in this sense.In short, taking into account how difficult must be to reopen an apparently closed story, one so important to the history of cinema, so relevant at so many levels more that 20y after its release, I think the film is surprising good because of how brave, intelligent and unapologetic it is.",8
5195,"No spoiler review.Saw The Matrix three times in the cinema in 1999 and bought the VHS and later the DVD and Bluray. It's been one of my favourite films of all time.This, however, felt like a half-arsed cash grab. The story definitely had potential and I enjoyed the first half where they keep you in the dark about what's actually going on.It's a film that couldn't decide what it wanted to be. A reboot, a sequel. So it tried to do both. The direction it was headed was interesting but they ultimately ended up playing it safe by catering to nostalgia instead of trying something new, which robbed it of its potential. The ending was just insultingly stupid. Acting was good to very good aside from one notable exception, which wasn't an inconsequential part. I'll admit to being very critical, it's a movie worth seeing, but in the context of ""I'm on holiday abroad where it's opening earlier than in my home country and I have limited time, but I also don't want to risk missing seeing it before it's out of the cinema"", well don't bother. In that case, wait and see it at home, preferably with a proper home cinema.",5
5196,"Identity politics are all over this movie, which doesn't have to be a bad thing. I get it Animus and Anima coming together to create the ultimate being. Male and female energy must be united in the self. I'm on my own growth journey and everything, but narrative structure developed for a reason and would have greatly benefitted the message of this thing.Please, live your truth, but try to make good movies, too.",4
5197,"Of course i am a huge fun of matrix.Matrix resurrections disappointed me in many ways. I didn't expect much from the scenario and i was right. The first half of the film tried to remind us the original matrix. But suddly looked like the same story. Writing wasn't good. I didn't expect to hear Morpheus word again but at least something better. Jessica Henwick wasn't a good choise from my point of view. I didn't like also that the film try to be funny sometimes. Even the look of the actors - Nio looked like John Wick, the new sun glasses and more. Finally the music. The music from the original matrix ( fight Morpheus - Nio, the gun scene) was epic instead with resurrections.",6
5198,"I don't know what I excepted really.. The 1999 Matrix was a game changer, made some people think of their lives in ""before and after Matrix "". This wasn't anything near, but anyhow worth watching.",7
5199,"I still love Matrix 1-3 and the whole culture and universal it built.Matrix 4 serves a very special personal purpose. It is a story about self healing for the director, Lana Wachowski, after she lost her important ones (both parents and a friend) in a short period of time. The resurrection of Neo and Trinity, and the highlight of love, reflects Lana's act to keep her lost and beloved creations alive again may ease her real life lost and struggles.Having said that, the script is lose and the delivery of the story was out of pace. In the first 40 mins, it was mostly viewed from the angle of a new Character ""Bugs"" and her leads to Neo. The dialogue often breaks the 4th wall, questioned the in movie reality and the necessity of a forth installment itself were all satisfying.However when the angle fully passed to Neo after he was freed and arrives IO, it all went down hill. The script will often have lengthly monologue from one character explaining the settling and the situation. It is like instead of acting it out with scenes, the director just have someone read it out to the audience. To me that is lazy directing and a sign of a weak script.Visually it is OK but all fight and action scenes are really bad in today's standard and lack of creativity. Ironically, "" Originality"" was one ofbthe things that the first 40 mins tease about and this movie cannot delivered. The fact that Lana somehow also directs all action scenes caused this downfall. I am not sure whether it is because they cannot get a good action director during COVID, or lack of resources. But weak action scenes in Matrix franchise is a heavy blow to the series fans.At the end of the day Matrix 4 is a movie that Director Lana made for herself and perhaps her lost ones. It added no extra depth to the universe. If you are a fan of the previous 3 you will need to find hard convincing to like this. I hope this is not the end of Matrix but the end of Neo and Trinity story line. They already save the human race and now ""freed"" and alive. Just let them move on and retired.",6
5200,"I really enjoyed the movie and I am a big fan of the classic one. I understand why so many people are disappointed. The reason is just because they are expecting the heavy gothic cyberpunk atmosphere from the first movie. But this just isn't happening. And it is obvious why! The idea here is from a new perspective. We see a lot more colour in the cinematography, but it isn't too much. The costumes are awesome. The dynamics are on the edge of leading you to confusion...but not too far :)) One can sense easiness going on...through the machines, guns blazing and all the crazy matrix stuff.And why are people complaining about the story?!? There is a natural continuity to the trilogy. And the coolest thing is the machines (sentients) who have decided to help the humans. Well...ok, maybe it is somewhat sugary...but why not?!?The most important thing is that the movie makers, I mean the whole team more than likely had a lot of fun all along the process and they didn't force things. The feeling is there.The Matrix Resurrections is the movie of the year!",8
5201,"It is my humble belief that a sequel should build upon the world and narrative of the original; not simply call back to the original, or acknowledge itself as a sequel. Unless that series is Scream (I love that series). The Matrix Resurrections does that. Eventually. But before we can see how the world has developed since Neo and Trinity sacrificed themselves, we waste a lot of time observing a simulation explaining the previous trilogy in the form of game-splanation. What I mean is, The Matrix is a game - and the characters discuss ad nauseam how the next game should reflect the previous games (nearly said film there) whilst keeping it 'original' and 'fresh'. You know? Like the writers of a massive franchise might if they were invited to write a sequel to a film from twenty years ago.There were positives to this film, obviously. The visuals were great; from little details like Neo's coat growing in length every time he tapped into his power, to Trinity-styled hair in the characters who grew up looking up to her legend. Explosions, Kung Fu fights, gun battles, great costumes. All of it made up for a great spectacle and I enjoyed that.I enjoyed the new additions of Buggs (who owned every scene she was in, with or without the blue hair to point her out in a crowd), Sequoia, Shepherd and Lexy. And I also enjoyed the rebranded and updated Smith and Morpheus. They both had enough 'Smith-isms' to feel authentic to the original characters, whilst also being fresh and original themselves. I put this down to great acting overall. There was an empathetic pull through out all the characters, and most importantly I believed them. I believed they had their own motivations, had their own opinions on Neo and Trinity, and acted in their own self interest - which isn't always easy to pull off with a big cast of beta characters. But it works here. The Analyst was interesting in that he was the complete opposite of the Architect. And I enjoyed the frame rate edit around his character whilst he was monologuing, even if I had zero interest in the monologue itself.The dialogue was info-dumpy and stunted. There was no banter, no moment for the audience to really *think* for themselves about what was happening or what was being said. The plot moved from pillar to post and some things felt so convenient that there was almost no tension at all. It was interesting to see Neo as a more passive protagonist, but only because the active protagonists were interesting. This was a film for Trinity and Buggs, and I'd love to see more storylines which centralise characters like them. The subtext of feminism and capitalism was not lost on me, I thought it a good choice to subvert our expectations throughout with Trinity falling into the motherhood roll, and thought her reaction to it at the end was well set up. Who doesn't love seeing a misogynist get his jaw clean kicked off?Overall it was a good film with a few things getting in its own way, and I think the large majority of what I didn't like about it was the meta call backs and fan service it tried to deliver - rather than the moments where it enjoyed being a sequel, adding to the world and characters and bathing in what is good about The Matrix. That it is a nerdy film, for nerdy people, gamers, programmers, readers and film lovers, which understands the power of story - even if it feels like it needs to explain that power to you like a child sometimes. The last bit I could have done without.",6
5202,"For the longest time I was hoping they would make another Matrix movie to make all forget about the 2 sequels so far. So my hopes went up when I heard there will be Matrix IV! The trailers really got me geared up and all I was hearing/reading prior to it's release got the suspense rising.Then the day came to finally see it.... and it took all but 20 minutes to burst my bubble when reality kicked in.This movie is even worse than Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions were, something I could never imagine.I give Lana Wachowski the credit for a simple but believable explanation, why Neo and Trinity are alive - but that is as much good as I have to say about the story. I could have thought of so many different plots to drive the story to new levels instead of basically retelling the original story on such a low level.If you are a fan of the trilogy, you will see the movie and it is my big believe, that this is the only reason the movie was made - to cash in on the big fanbase. I am not sure though that was such a good idea.",6
5203,This movie was awesome it was just like the original matrix the fight scenes the story were all good......................................................................................................if you dont like the movie then you were never a true fan of the original.....................,8
5204,"I'm a huge fan of the MATRIX trilogy and I think that Lana Wachowski is a visionary director. THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS, the latest installment in the MATRIX franchise, has a lot of things going for it: the performances, the action scenes, the CGI (most of it) are all top notch.My problem with the movie is that it feels irrelevant since it is not adding anything sigificant to the story esablished it the first three movies. That story has a good ending and if you want to continue that story after almost 20 years you need to come up with something truly original. Sadly THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS not much more then a re-telling of the same story in an updated setting and although this isn't a reboot it certainly feels like one.But here is the funny part: the movie is filled with critism of Hollywoods reboot culture and its lack of original ideas but the movie is exactly that. The nostalgia, the fan service, the woke culture, the recreation of things we have already seen, it is all there; but it is so much in your face that I wonder if that was Lana Wachowskis intention all along. Showing Hollywood the middle finger by making a movie that encapsules all that is wrong with the movie industry. If that's the case, it would be kind of genius!",6
5205,"While not the worse movie I've seen, this was just painfully slow and misguided for the first two hours. The last 25 minutes were entertaining, but the first two hours could have been summed up in about 5 minutes.",4
5206,Went in with a open mind. At the end of the movie I was thinking WTF did I just watch. This must be a joke. Keanu should of just said NO! Boring story. Not enough action. Please do not make another one and sully the franchise even more.,3
5207,"I didnt think the story was bad and it was an diverting enough flick but ... i do miss the self importance of original (and to an extent 2 and 3) they were all glitz, glam and too cool for school self impotance of the originals the architect was verbose spouting gobbledygook with a sense of authority where the analyst is Barny Stinson .Morpheus was reduced to comic relief , and as forgettable as the crew was in the original outside of Joey Pants you still remember his name , but the blue haired chick is just gonna be remember as the blue haired chick ( i cant even be bothered to look up the characters name)",6
5208,"I guess many have waited for this movie to come out, and yet many were disappointed on how weak the story played out to be.A fantastic movie has a strong intact storyline like ""The Matrix"", the one mesmorizing enough to close your eyes on few issues it had.The new film though, has been created on a fluid and shaky foundation of discussions around the first sequel and is not convincing enough with all those issues what I call ""story holes"" in it.A few new elements that were put in the story, seem to have been borrowed from some other films, in an attempt to be eye-catching. But at the end of the day, they cannot elevate the story, instead these elements have damaged the originality of the film.Hoped the Wachowski brothers were still having the spark, but my opinion they have created an episod of a movie series that don't possess anything except some minor amusement points.",6
5209,"The story is good, there's no doubt about it. Better than the trilogy? Mmm no, but close. There are 2 main things that are ruining the movie, first one is acting, the second one is in the title of this review. Movie just feels too rushed, it's like someone had a brain storm of ideas and had to write them down asap so they don't forget them. I think they should have taken more time to develop it properly, that's all. The atmosphere of the movie is not something you should compare to the originals. The point of previous movies was to make you feel what Neo felt (to look at the world through his eyes), like falling through the rabbit hole. This one makes you feel like you're the blue pill, like you're the part of the system (at least in the first 1/3 of the movie), but they went a bit too far with that and I think that's what is bothering people. This one is not dark like the originals, it's quite the opposite and I get it, it's the new version of the matrix after all. I read somewhere that the story doesn't hold the water because the war with machines was over. Well, here is a tiny spoiler, so if you haven't watched the movie yet stop here. Not all machines wanted the war to be over ;).",8
5210,"Yes it is flawed - action not particularly impressive, long run time, fair amount of exposition, questionable recasting of ""Morpheus"" and Agent Smith...But...people saying the film is a spoof / parody of itself are missing the point, as are those saying it doesn't do anything new. Lana W didn't want to make another Matrix, Warner Bros did and were going to with or without her. No other film has found a way to weave this commentary into the narrative which this film does (by positioning the new Thomas Anderson has producer of the original trilogy in video game format.)Lana W has taken an opportunity she didn't want and turned it into a brave take on Hollywood and individual creativity.Those saying there is no point in this film are also missing the point. It is a love story at heart. And that is it's point. Love is the most important thing we have.",7
5211,"The Matrix Resurrections was a half-thought idea that had so much potential. Niel Patrick Harris was a horrible cast. The chemistry between Trinity and Neo was so cold. It pissed me off. The machine / human partnership gave the storyline somewhere to go but they didn't bother....I absolutely love Keanu Reeves and he delivers as a rusty neo. His character's limitations were enfuriating. If this was a ""one last ride"" film, it didn't deliver. If this was a true resurrection of the franchise, it didn't deliver. If this was a parody, it definitely delivered.So glad I got to see another matrix movie and so mad this will be the finale. If you need me, I'll be in the past, enjoying the Matrix Trilogy.",2
5212,"Be frank, i nearly slept when i were watchingFar-fetched story, old actorsThe trilogy should be ended gracefully in a decade ago but it ""revived"" embarrassingly at last.A disgrace to real ""Matrix/"" at all, it totally ruins my impression to a used-to-be masterpiece.P. S. The 3 points are tributed to Keanu.",2
5213,"It is a must watch movie ... for those that understand and like this story. I've talked to people that like its special effects and all, but don't really understand the story. Ok ... for these people it will be a more or less thing ... you really need to get it to apreciate it. In this movie, mankind is no longer in war with the machines ... its a love story between two people ... I think its getting under rated because its been rated by people that don't get the concept of The Matrix and was hoping for more action, destruction and death ...",8
5214,"To me it just felt like a rushed presentation that is filled with texts and then presented by someone who only reads off the slides. Yeah. The whole thing could've been a 50% shorter if they'd only had shorter and more meaningful sequences, instead of either loooooong fights or looooong dialogue sessions. They need the dialogues because there is so much to explain, but isn't that what we liked about the matrix? That it leaves you a little puzzled...The only good part was the subtle humor. That, is enjoyable.",6
5215,"As there are only 3 Die Hard movies, there are only 3 Matrix movies. CGI are ok but the movie is really super boring, spends a good part of it's time trying to explain the viewer as to why it needed to be made in the first place... This only should worry any fan of the franchise. Ultimately it's just another cheap cash grab that can be safely ignored, especially if you don't want to be left with a bitter taste in your mouth after watching it.",2
5216,""""" For those who didn't watch the movie yet!!...don't even try to """"Obviously this movie is the worst chapter in ""The Matrix"" franchise by all means. From the beginning till the end, the movie was an amateur production, everything was ""cheap"", bad lighting, story and most important of all the fight scenes.",1
5217,"Found myself struggling to finish this movie, almost fell asleep towards the end.Mindless action scenes, mediocre story, unnecessarily long. Could have been compressed into 2 hours.The flashbacks to the older movies felt pretty unprofessional, and poorly done.I was really looking forward to this movie, but I guess this series died after the 2nd movie.The first Matrix movie is still a masterpiece, 9/10, the 2nd one was 7/10, and since then it's gone below 5.This moves deserves 2/10, but rating it 4/10 out of respect for the series.",4
5218,"As the title says, Matrix Resurrections does not deserve all this hate from the internet.The concept and the story are interesting and I liked that. But this movie seemed rushed to me and maybe this was the case for the problems it has.I was really disappointed in action sequences, cheap tricks were used as shaky cam and choppy cuts and sometimes it felt like watching Power Rangers.There were some cool effects though, the new antagonist was very interesting and powerful until he wasn't which resulted in a very weak ending.After all I did enjoy the movie but it cannot compare nowhere near to its predecessors.",6
5219,"Gotta say, I thought they were going to pull off a successful sequel. All the right mind bending premise, love story, and Matrixy fight scenes were there. Then something went wrong. Near the end it seemed as though Shaun of the Dead writers were brought in to toss in a couple scenes. Hokey and pure awesome for Shaun, bipolar and I'll fitting for Matrix.",5
5220,"I admit the film started a little slowly. It took a little time to build, but it did have some interesting twists. The leads still have great chemistry, Morpheus was a fantastic character too. Jonathan Groff and Neil Patrick Harris were fantastic and highly entertaining in their roles. I also like how the spin was made off of each character to their present days lives. Don't listen to the haters, if you loved the original series, give this movie a chance!",7
5221,Most the movie was good. Then near the end they got cheesy and over acted the two Mekong them over op and movie got boring and stupid to watch I think. Was very disappointed after that. Was enjoying the movie before that happened.,7
5222,It took me 5 attempts to watch the entire movie. Loved the original Matrix movie - one of the best movies I have ever seen. This one was just horrible. So many flashbacks to the original movies because this one added nothing to the series. I feel sorry for anyone wasting their time watching it.,1
5223,"After watching i feel like there was no reason to make this movie. Its like making a movie about how Greedo shot first and two hours of why. Like most I loved the matrix, and I even really liked the 2nd and 3rd movies too. I really felt that the ending to Revolutions was great. It was tragic and yet the cost of Neo's and Trinity's deaths really made a difference for war between Zion and the machines.Now with Resurrections they are rewriting the whole mythology. NEO REALLY wasn't the One. Its really the Two... or more. It's fun nostalgia but that's it. I was glad I streamed this rather than paying full ticket price.",5
5224,"Watch out without any expectations you'll love it.Personally I expected more, in terms of story, fight scenes, etc.,It took me a while before I was fully understanding what was happening, but despite that, I enjoyed it from start to finish. Definitely referential in a good way, but it really picks up in the latter half of the movie when it goes into newer, unknown territory.",6
5225,"To be honest, I've been thinking about the sequel for the last two days... There was simply no other way to make the 4th movie. (plot wise). Obviously more action scenes would have been good, but then again, it's 2.5h long already to ensure that the plot is executed as it was. Solid.",8
5226,"No movie will ever live up to the original matrix but I think this movie did a pretty good job. It isn't perfect by any means but I think it is worth a watch. People giving this 1-2 stars is a bit dramatic. That would imply that this is is one of the worst movies ever made and it is not even close to that. Overall I enjoyed the movie and if you enjoyed the other matrix movies, this movie should be entertaining to you. Don't let hyperbolic reviews of this movie ruin your outlook and expectations, give it a try.",7
5227,"The first half was good, the second half was not overpowering, and the epicness of the series was gone, instead of funny jokes. NO green filter that makes the Matrix movies the Matrix, this decision has nonsense. Still, it was fun to return to the Matrix after all these years. Normally 2.5/5 but I'm giving 3 out of love for Matrix but the potential was wasted sad :(",7
5228,"I went into The Matrix Ressurections After seeing the two trailers only. Although the second trailer already spoiled some twists and the IMDB score already was below 6.1 I was still looking forward to see something original, unexpected and interesting.The movie delivered to some extent - I was not exactly bored watching it. But it lacks so much while it is full of things that should have been left out.Matrix Resurrections is self aware and makes a ton of nods to the original franchise and the behind the scenes processes of a big media company.In one scene, Neo's Boss mentions the studio which owns the company where they both work at - Warner Brothers. The very same studio that happens to own the rights to the Matrix films.«They keep asking every year - will we do a sequel [...] and now the time has come [...] they will do it with or without us.»And that's exactly how I imagine things went down with this movie.So maybe the movies shortfalls are not an accident - maybe it's all meant to be that way ... maybe it's just Lana Wachowski being tired of executives harassing her to tell a story she doesn't want to tell.The more I think about it, the more sense it makes. While some changes make perfect sense (no Phone Booths to go in and out of the Matrix) others like Teleporting to another Continent (We need to have at least one scene in Asia!) are far fetched and way to rulebending for protagonists who are not «The One""» for a supposedly more advanced mind control simulation.I am more than fine with the Idea of advanced AI (hence Machine World) and Humans forging alliances ... even if it is to grow strawberries in an secret underground base protected by Holograms. What I don't understand is how on earth AI could start a war over resources - in this case electrical power!? In all those years the machines were incapable of finding another source of power then human body heat? Like I don't know - Nuclear Power? But hey - now the movie is socially critical.Everyone knows that the bodyheat-energy-supply-thing was imposed onto the Wachowskis by studio executives. But guys - that happens in the 90s! We're in 2021 - everyone is afraid to lose their jobs to an AI. A perfect opportunity missed, to set things right and place the human race to the right side of the equation as part of a neural network.But I'm losing myself. I wasn't finished with Lana vs. WB yet.This movie wasted a painfully long amount of time on insights on how marketing people supposedly think and work - trying to ease the tension (which did not exist at this point of time) and ticking off another executive checkbox: Imagine StarWars and Wolf of Wallstreet making a really humorless Exec-Checkbox-Baby with the intention to make one dude in the whole audience laugh irritatingly loud while everyone else is silent.The new esthetics - or let's say the lack of esthetics in the Matrix Ressurrections checks off the «Let's do something new and subvert viewers expectations» checkbox.If you are looking to see some visually appealing imagery which feels like you are in a Matrix movie? Do you want to see awesome fighting choreographies making you wish to try a wall-run for yourself? We'll you better be prepared to have your expectations subverted! Expect «The Dark Knight Rises» Fight scenes with everything that made them great and rememberable - meaning nothing. But there's a bright spot: you can show everyone how awesome your HDR TV is and make a stupid face if no one sees any meaningful difference to the overall experience.But don't worry - the movie will cut away to various scenes of the original trilogy - just in case you forgot ... or maybe to be more accessible to audiences which did not see the original trilogy (Check!)?However - the visual design of everything outside of the Matrix - for instance the Hovercrafts - inside and outside - is quite appealing! But I'm still trying to figure out what the purpose of the Dolphin-Manta-Ray-Robot with cloaking abilities was before it joined forces with the human race. (Merchandise? I did not do any research - but let's say: Check!)Speaking of spending time outside of the Matrix: I don't understand why the visit to IO was even necessary for the story. Nothing relevant happened there except of providing an insight in Human-Machine relationships and stocking up on more replaceable characters for finale. This insight should have been a three liner piece of exposition inside of the loading area.Speaking of finales: While every Matrix Movie has an Iconic scene - The Lobby Shooting, The Burly Brawl oder the final Smith/Neo battle - The Matrix Resurrections decided to establish a fast and furious «AI Swarm Attack» sprinkled with some last minute «Love is the key ...because ...» thing as it's own Iconic scene.Only that in this case the cars are replaced by humans, devolving to zombies and human piano replacements - jumping out of windows - trying to hit the escaping heroes from above only to finish with a nice empowerment twist (Check!) where Trinity gains «The One's» powers while Neo seems to be stuck with some newly gained Force-Telekinesis-Powers (which you will see a really big lot of) through the course movie.And I am totally fine with this reversed roles thematic - if only it would not feel rushed, emotionally shallow and completely forgettable. (Neil Patrick Harris's line on how women were easier to control in the good old days makes it even worse)But wrapping up: The movie does exactly what it was supposed to do - it teaches studio executives and other greedy industry leaders and whatever-marketing-rockstars to overthink the concepts they established for almost every franchise.Movies are not successful because of some market research results or because you run some numbers and cram your interpretation of those numbers into a script with the highest amount of checked checkboxes possible. They are successful despite of them - so sometimes it's better to give your IPs some time - even if it's another 20 years.",5
5229,"As a fan of the Matrix this movie was an excellent Christmas present. It was nice to see Neo and Trinity on the screen after so long. But I have to say, the story took a bit more than expected to develop, which made me feel robbed of it's essence. I couldn't wait to see their action scenes and then poof! All gone in 5 minutes.Nevertheless, I am so happy that it was released and that they were able to make a story that made sense within the context. The outfits and looks of all the characters were also nothing short from excellence. In summary, let's just say the movie made my day, week and month. So for me it is simple, if you are a fan you would love it but if you are not is a not going to persuade you.",9
5230,"The movie literally says it in dialogue: Warner Bros decided to do Matrix 4 with or without Wachowskis. Rather than leave the reins to someone else, Lana decided to take a paycheck and see how far she can get away with it.In that regard, this movie is a masterpiece. Lana fighting the corporate machines, pushing the limits on how to create a movie that does get released, yet at the same time being so bad to completely destroy any chances of a franchise revival or additional sequels.Same way as Neo gave the finger to Smith in my favorite movie ever, Lana is now giving a finger to studio execs and even getting paid for it.I was expecting Matrix 4 to blow and there was little chance it would live up to anyone's expectations, but I certainly didn't expect this. This movie is basically a parody of itself. It's not only an end to a franchise but also Lana's career, which is sad because I'm a fan of lots of other stuff created by the Wachowskis.The original Matrix had fantastic action, story, music, camerawork, editing, fight choreography, costumes, cast and acting, special effects, dialogue, ... It did everything right. The two 2003 sequels weren't as good but are still entertaining and enjoyable.Matrix 4, however, is a pile of garbage. Instead of giving the aforementioned execs the finger, Lana could have at least made something passable as a movie. Instead, she gave the finger to fans like me as well.",4
5231,"Like other reviewers, The Matrix is one of my all-time favorite movies. I realize now, after watching the trilogy to prepare for yesterday's opening of Resurrections, that I loved the original so much because of the unique story (i.e., the classic hero's journey with just a small glimpse into Neo's seemingly unlimited power at the end). When released, the bullet time camera work was super innovative, but that, nor the acting, made it a classic.The next two of the trilogy were kind of not-so-great movies and were in no way as amazing as the first, but did an excellent job telling the rest of the story. Resurrections is a bit of the opposite--a very entertaining and well-done movie (one caveat), with a not-so-great story.In my opinion, the fourth installment could have been much better if the story was about a previous version of ""the one"" or the next coming. I personally believe that Lana Wachowski's decision that this new movie would be about Neo and Trinity's relationship was ultimately the problem. The way they brought these two back was good and I love Trinity, but the story of ""these two"" should have remained closed.By the way, the caveat mentioned above was the usage of clips from the trilogy, which was not only unnecessary, but actually made the new movie worse. Why would Neo remember things like they were seen from a third person? This tactic seemed to be a crutch used to help tell the story and/or possibly an attempt to link great, nostalgic memories from 18+ years ago to the new film.Overall, Resurrections was a solid movie. Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Neil Patrick Harris were great, as were the other new actors (including those from Sense8), and the cinematography was fantastic. The story line was mediocre and had some highlights, like tying in Sati, but was not enough to make a new Matrix franchise possible. It sure would be great if Lana tries again though.",7
5232,"Left more to be desired. Did not live up to expectations.The movie felt a bit rushed and would have needed less is more.Though it had a lot of action and fighting, but it lacked excitement and tension.",5
5233,"I expected the sequel to disappoint me because of the script, but the opposite happened. The idea was good, interesting and had its strong points, which could and can develop... BUT the implementation was terrible! It was like a second-rate film made for Netflix - meaningless dialog, insanely stupid and unnecessary humor, terribly weak cast (Agent Smith - not serious to choose this actor, things became quite tragic with Morpheus, and the Matrix itself, the actor plays was on level, but the image of Neil Haris is not serious too). The music was an absolute compromise - the trilogy was known for the perfect synchronicity between action scenes and music on the background, while in the new sequel, the most epic battles were accompanied by a standard monotonous sound! The bullet shield of Neo - how many times it had to be used, where the second helicopter disappeared before it reappeared... mistake after mistaker .. and yes, if I watch SpiderMan, I will not be impressed and I do not care. However, the Matrix comes with an iconic status and such mistakes irritate and spoil the whole feeling.",6
5234,Great writers still need editors. One great movie followed by now 3 failures. This should have never been made. Fake drama. Revisiting a ton of forgotten characters. This movie is completely weighed down by the past.,3
5235,6 stars maximum we saw few moments of action but still it was better in the trilogy despite the fact that technology has evolved. There is no room for matrix 5 its my opinion and the explanation why Neo and Trinity stayed alive wasn't the best. If they will make a fifth movie please really please make it worth.,6
5236,"I never had high expectations for this remake but curiosity got the better of me. However, I did not expect the film to be this bad and poorly constructed.I went and watched the film on Christmas Eve...If only I went a watched Spider-Man instead!",2
5237,"I tried 2 times to watch it. Gave up. The rules of IMDB Review postings state that I must use at least 150 charactors before it will be accepted. I've added all these additional empty, meandering and unrelated sentences to meet the minimum required word count using the same college freshman level composition criteria the Watchowski's did in writing this screenplay. Jeez.",1
5238,"I actually enjoyed this movie alot..I thought the storyline was pretty well thought out other than a couple of plot holes, the action sequences were a very good throw back to the matrix of old and IMO the script was good...I like how the machines reintegrate neo and trinity and make them feel like they've lost their minds...of corse it wasn't everything I was hoping for but it was still a very good watch and I've enjoyed it the 4 times I've watched it so far.",8
5239,"Matrix4 most of the top critics and average general movie consumers are complaining that this isn't good, that isn't good, the movie doesn't have the revelation, the complexity, the suspense, the mystery, the mind-blowing new theories and concepts and ideas, the twists and turns, the mind-blowing action sequences, and that the movie is a money-grab but I beg to differ. Sorry for saying this but I have to say that it is their bloated egos and arrogance which is constructing their conscious mind to give negative opinions and reviews. But everybody has right to have opinions. Here is my opinion and review. First up, I would like to give 7/10 rating and recommend people to watch it after watching the original matrix trilogy. My justification is that if you are a hardcore cyber-techno-science-fiction enthusiast you will definitely appreciate and like the movie. It has all the qualities that I mentioned above in this article. Just see for yourself and judge, can't you spend some money on holiday season. If you are an average movie consumer who likes comedy or melodrama it would not be that entertaining. As for people saying it has no original ideas, it is a sequel not a new original movie, it builds and introduces new ideas and concepts and complexity over the original ones. Critics and average movie consumers must be grateful for the technology that they have and times they live in where you can watch 4k HD movies on your laptops and TV's and IMAX theatres instead of complaining like a cry baby. As for people saying it is a money-grab movie, people make movies not just for entertaining people but for making a livelihood out of it. Thousands of people are employed for producing a movie. Thank you! Good day!",7
5240,"Only logical explanation for this sequel is just a smack in Warner brothers face, becouse they hade a contract with them for endless sequels, but someone had to stop them and they did good, no more trash ever. It was all explaind at the begining of this messy movie.",3
5241,"The overall story was almost boring. When there was action scenes they were as to be expected from the Matrix franchise. Most of the movie i.e the first hour and a half or so, felt almost depressing and a waste of time to watch. I think this movie could have been better if the majority of the story wasn't so depressing and lackluster in movement. It was interesting to see some original caricatures, other than Neo and Trinity, appear as well but very little of them in the story was a let down. And the reboot of Morpheus as a freed agent, didn't do the caricature justice. I have been wait in excited anticipation for about two years for this movie to come out, just to be let down and practically disappointed with it. I don't know, I did stay awake until 2am central time to see it so there's a possibility that sleep deprivation could play a part in my review. As a true Matrix fan, I will watch it again after some sleep and see if that helps my viewpoint at all. Stay tuned.Free my mind!",6
5242,"In the first half you feel bored but then after first half the story line become more and more interested and keanu, carie and Neil just nailed it. Thoroughly After a long await this movie provide all of you a good amount of entertainment.🙏",9
5243,"Enjoyable movie if you like the original Trilogy and ""Lore"" of them too but Why did they did that to my boy Morpheus. They tried to hard for no good reason with throwing too much spazz and ""Culture"" onto a him and it doesn't fit with the original characters mannerisms or personality at all even though it's supposed to be the same person. Agent Smith was butchered aswell. Everyone else did a good job.",6
5244,"What did I just saw?! Guys, this was a completely boring and worthless product of 2021. Why? WHY?The Matrix has so much potential, the brothers had done a fantastic job, the trilogy has created a cult, a huge mass of fans and therefore a great disappointment was achieved by this movie.The story unfolded VERY SLOWLY, and apart from Neo's release of Trinity, no other significant development really took place.I just couldn't get used to the new characters and the ""normal"" coloured world. Two actors also appear from the director's 2015 series (Sense8), who I couldn't identify with their new role because of the mentioned Netflix series. Jonathan Groff, who plays Smith Agent, couldn't sell me the main villain from the previous 3 episodes ... and Neil Patrick Harris just didn't fit into the world of The Matrix. There were no real fight scenes, there was almost no excitement, the sight was beautiful and elaborate, but also salivating (honey-glazed).The story seemed to take a lot of time to showcase the new lives of the two main characters and to make the current (4th) and following episode(s). Of the sequel seem legitimate to exist.In my opinion, the director brothers were huge with the first 3 parts, but the director who went from Laurence to Lana was overly softened. I watched and liked the Sense8, but I didn't think this gender identity shift would affect the Matrix as well.As we have seen with the Terminator films, none of the descendants were able to surpass the greatness of T2, so if the Matrix continues along this line, it was a pity to continue.The iMDB score displays fall accordingly.",5
5245,"This is not a movie that you can fully enjoy with one viewing. It is extremely confusing and perhaps overwhelmingly ambitious to the casual audience. However, as someone that has been following this franchise for most of my life, I appreciate that Lana Wachowski did what she does best-- take risks. The movie left me with as many (if not more) questions as answers upon it's anti-climatic ending, but it was certainly worth watching as a fan of this franchise. The commentary was extremely relevant, the fight scenes were exciting, and the chemistry between Keanu and Carrie-Ann as Neo and Trinity was very real. Would not recommend to those expecting an action-movie blockbuster like the 1999 Matrix. Would recommend to those that enjoy being challenged by movies and forced to confront uncomfortable truths about our world.",7

Chose to be blissfully amused at what you might think the future holds?Watched said marriage create intrinsically self-defining moments that then began to disintegrate slowly over time. This, sadly, inevitably led you to a divorce.Fortuitously, we are simple. Life goes on. You let that feeling of abandonment and nuance flutter away as the years age. Of course, because we are gluttons, we don't turn off what we posted in the past. We let ourselves be reminded every so often of items we should have deleted. We are amused of feelings of what was once good, momentarily relived in our heads or our hearts, and give thanks that it's not currently where you're at...Well, that's what you'll get with The Matrix ResurrectionsA bad decision that we should have turned our timehop off on many moons ago.I don't know how a single movie made me happy, embarrassed, bored, and annoyed all at the same time?Anyone else?",5
5247,"They clearly wanted to make the aesthetic different to what we were used to but without the green sheen tinting the matrix it just didn't feel quite right. Even in the real world the grit and dirt seemed to have been too polished away making everything feel that little more fake.The characters all seemed to lack a distinct sense of danger or tension. The story was not by any means a bad premise and could well have worked and added to the Matrix mythology but the makeover of the visuals just didn't feel like it was a part of that world anymore.You would thinking watching the near immortal and impervious protagonist struggle and lose his godlike powers would help make him more relatable, but it felt like we were watching old man Neo stumble between scenes all while craving for him to explode out to his previous glory.A good story idea lost in very un-Matrix like delivery.",4
5248,"To put it short and sweet without getting too much into it. The Matrix Resurrections, taking place 60 years after the events of Revolutions, is released 18 years later in real time; has the most solid script since the original. It's meta nature owes some gratitude to Wes Cravens New Nightmare with its commentary on sequels, fan culture, cultural significance, etc...but where the script excels is its discussion of nostalgia and how its overly relied upon and also easily misconstrued. Its continuing discussion of identity and how our modern ages even further increased reliance upon technology causes us to have a symbiotic relationship with tech where we both benefit while also sometimes getting lost in our own created fictions that is manufactured by our own minds and algorithms from outside sources. The analyst is the most interesting aspect of this film with his entire breakdown of how algorithms and analytics have manipulated our everyday interactions and views of the modern world. Its a script that's strength is built upon the 18 years of experience of Lana Wachowski as well. Her personal journey from 1999 to 2022 is strewn throughout this plot and it feels less contrived as the 2nd and 3rd films and more personal and focused life the original.It's just a shame the last 10 minutes fall so flat and feel tagged on after an awesome setpiece of a chase scene through the streets. A stronger plot thematically with some interesting discussion points and less focus on action than it's ideas. Well worth a rewatch and a welcome return to a groundbreaking series.",7
5249,"The core storyline can be said in one sentence without even the need of a comma usage. The production was really good but felt like it could have been way better had the story not shunted it and dragged it down with excessive dialog padding. It makes me wonder how the review process for these stories are being carried out. One would hope that they are using technology such as text to speech to make audio books out of them, and then use review teams in iterative systemic approaches, etc. Seems like a huge waste of money to not do this, because the movie did really bad in theaters I hear.",6
5250,"This is the movie where ""Matrix"" franchise put a nail in their coffin. Salute to WB for killing and forcing another franchise to their doom. It's hard to believe that Lana made this movie.no plt, no Story, not even a standard script. Actors ar acting like they Were forced to do this film. The only reason people are going to see THIS movie is for Keanu Reeves and the respect for Matrix Trilogy. This is the death of Matrix.",2
5251,"Mixed feelings. My first thought after watching the HBO Max version of 'Resurrections' on a 65"" 4K flat screen and a 9.1 Dolby Atmos system was that it was a bit tedious with an abundance of explanatory dialogue and clips from the trilogy that sucked some of the fun out of it. Kind of like a Woody Allen film, only not amusing. Funny to think how it always depressed me when Neo would say he wasn't The One. I had a similar tinge of sadness watching 'Resurrections'.On the other hand, Lana Wachowski took risks with the storyline. Ultimately, it's a love story. I admire that approach, but I didn't feel the magic from the previous segments, unfortunately. Maybe Lana was sending us a warning with that goofy ""The Catrix"" extra bit.",6
5252,"""The Matrix 4: Ressurection"" is a difficult film. It's different from the previous films in many ways. It comes up with a lot of ideas and concepts and, above all, new casts that are definitely unusual and that not everyone will get used to. The beginning of the film, for example, is very self-referential and peppered with meta-comments, which at the end even turn out to be part of clever ideas that fit perfectly into the philosophy and basic concept of ""The Matrix"". The film is a well-dosed mixture of pieces of old, already seen stuff, both plot elements as well as characters and places and new stuff, new characters and new approaches to the staging and already establisht characters. ""The Matrix 4: Ressurection"" shows us a lot of old things, but in a different way, in a new guise and at the same time offers a sequel that is defacto based on the Original Trilogy, it tells the story further, establishes new ideas, continues the story, offers great Effects, great action and by the way opens the door for a completely new trilogy... And honestly, I want this new Trilogy!!! This new part will definitely not please everyone, you really have to go with it...",7
5253,"I was hoping to be blown away by Matrix 4, but it was only on par with my realistic expectations. The conclusion of the story was not something that Mark Zackerburg and David Chalmers would disagree with.",
5254,"I cannot believe that people will fall for this remake of the Matrix! This was lazy directing! I cannot believe that the 2 main characters came back for this movie! But I guess the paycheck was very good for them.As an audience member, I felt cheated and let down .I watched 3 movies and knew that Neo was the One but now Trinity is the One?!?!?Super let down and on top of that they did a remake of the Rage Against the Machine song Calm like a Bomb.",2
5255,"If this is the last movie they did terrible job, they have to make a next matrix movie.I liked the beginning that NEO is doing and referring to matrix I, but a lot things was just repeating mechanism with no progression, surprise element is long gone, if you watch matrix III, then watching matrix IV will not give you more of the story. Not sure what authors were after but I think maybe they can reveal everything in the next matrix movie.",7
5256,"Keanu is the only reason to see it.As fars as the main story line its a mess, they should do another movie with a different name, without killing the Matrix franchise.Its a mess, new characters wanna be old characters but failed miserably.The movie is not good, the could have done a decent movie without the recasting and creating some new characters.This is a mock of the matrix.",5
5257,"The original Matrix trilogy is one of my favorite series of all time, with Matrix Reloaded being the worst (in my opinion) of the films. With that being said, I still enjoyed/loved all three of the originals. Once I started the newest movie I was immediately taken in by the nostalgia. Seeing Neo and Trinity on screen again has been a long time coming. The chemistry between the two actors is undeniable, and both Keanu and Carey are timeless wonders and incredible actors. After you get past that, the movie and plot start to fall apart at a rapid pace. Let's start with Morpheus and the actor who portrayed him. His entire plot device, along with the acting, seemed forced and ham-fisted. The same goes for the actor who played a youthful version of agent Smith. All of the ""crew"" members who were the newest generation were equally forgettable. Their acting was forced, stiff and largely frustrating. It played out as a cast of B movie actors trying to reinvigorate roles they just weren't experienced enough to pull of. Jada Smith, as an aged and cantankerous Naiobi...just yikes. She was unrelentingly painful to watch. Neil Patrick Harris, another ageless wonder, was a bright spot in the film. The motivation of the character he portrayed however was contrived and bland. The background and setting of the movie had none of the feel as the original trilogy. Part of what made those films so memorable was the dark setting and the hint of ominous green silhouettes surrounding everything. It compounded the sinister nature of the Matrix and made viewers succinctly aware of the characters being in a simulation. In this film, everything seemed excessively bright and over-saturated. Bullet-time in the original series was a jaw dropping and masterful use of new special effects. In this movie, it was a crutch they used entirely too many times. The special effects team brought nothing new to the film and relied on the original SE breakthroughs for action sequences. It certainly did not work and I found the fight scenes to be dreadfully boring. I don't regret watching the movie since it was available to view through one of my monthly streaming services. If I had taken my family to see this in the theater I would have been sorely disappointed. A few dollars for a rental and it's a decent time killer, but shelling out a pretty penny to see it on the big screen would have left me feeling more than a little bitter. It was good at times, leaned towards mediocre through most of the film, and never came close to being great. It certainly did not capture the thought provoking nature we all experienced years ago, and fell exponentially short of bring back the magic of the original trilogy.",5
5258,"In no way can I avoid the cliché by beginning with..The story of The Matrix is undoubtedly close to my heart. All nostalgia set aside, the original film told such a spectacular tale of the sentient and it's attempt to unravel the layers of what is around him; the so-called reality; awareness of surroundings beyond the 5 senses we possess as humans. The consecutive sequels carried the story line but in no way did they add up to the masterpiece that is the original Matrix film.The sequels are worth watching, as (as I mentioned) they keep the storyline going outside of the matrix.This film is a poor attempt at a reboot of an incredible story. The writer essentially had two options; to recreate the storyline or carry on with it. They failed to do either.The film was an incredible disappointment, as it failed to explain numerous encounters; for example, the reason Neo had forgotten all of his capabilities and somehow believed the Matrix was his reality. The poor Gen Z attempts at humor made me quickly lose interest, and the failure to carry the storyline led me to shut it off. I ended up watching Animatrix, which I highly recommend if you enjoy the Matrix storyline.I could not get through 3/4 of the film before turning it off (I watched on hboMAX)I'm beyond glad that I did not waste my time going to the cinema to view this, as I would've walked out before it was over. If you're a fan of The Matrix and its intricacies, stay away. If you like to see good actors play mediocre roles, this is the film for you.",3
5259,"This movie was dedicated to such sheep only, as was said at the end of the film. Even if the trailer is created in boring way that a person thinks ""whether should I really watch it?"". It is necessary to trust this feeling (voice): it will be bad. Again, I did not listen to this ""voice"". My fault.",1
5260,"This is what I really feel after watching the movie as a story and not just remembering it as something most people here do (explained in the movie about 24 minutes in). I enjoyed the love conquers all aspect of it. I liked how ""Trinity is alive"" was explained. I also liked the new Io and the progress humans have made in the last 60 years.I did not expect to see anything really amazing or iconic (I mean Marvel and so many others are way ahead with CGI that it seems moot to do this) and I cringed when it they went to a similar location (the hallway, the terrace, the helicopter). I get the nostalgia but there are enough flashbacks in the ""game"" itself to not need these anymore.I absolutely hated the fighting sequences, starting from the first scene. The guns are blazing and there is nothing to block for Bugs but she is not getting hit (Star Wars Stormtroopers much). Also Keanu's fighting scenes felt too fake, slow, lacking energy, and just plain ugh. I would rather have the fighting shots be focused on the newer characters.They missed out on so many other things they could have focused on. Where is the betrayal in the team? Where is the tension that was built up? They had the characters and they also had a dialogue there but they did not go through with it. (This might sound counter to what I said previously, but I did not feel anything for the crew that I did in the first movie. That raw tension of being stuck with 5 people, eating goop and just searching for something that might not be there).The new Io politics scene? It is again there in one or two lines and completely missed out on. Peace begets infighting at some point. 60 years they have had peace, where is the cultural shift in Io?The big machine vs machine fight? There needs to be more. What was the solution that they found? It is all so vague.Also, Smith, I thought he wanted to come out of the Matrix and the technology is now available. Why did he not go for it? The fight could have been brought to the real world.I must applaud WB for their attempt with the game company parts, even though it did not bring the feeling it should have. Everyone knew the Matrix was real from the first moment. It would have been so much better if the real world had changed drastically. It would have been a nice surprise but instead we only saw what we had already seen.There is just too much that they missed out on that they could have made whole movies out of. I expect the youtubers to have so much content on this film. However, that being said, I still enjoyed it though I would not watch it again. It is not memorable.",7
5261,"In the first half hour where we find Neo reinserted in the Matrix as a game designer of a movie based on his memories it gives some messages that warner was going to do the movie with or without them..so it would have been better that the original producers made it. But sadly no.The movie made no sense until half of the movie has passed. It's FULL of flashbacks, almost like you feel like an amnesia patient. Don't understand why they also took bits from the original and reenacted them. Line by line and the same shots and movements.The action was underwhelming, nothing original here. The ending action was weird to say the least, a bit seemed like a zombie movie and the falling bodies...?!?!Disappointed.",5
5262,"It's generally a good movie. I enjoyed watching it, and I will consider watching the sequels.Now I believe there's too much happening in a short period of time, to the point it makes the movie a little bit confusing.The story of the previous Matrix movies was more focused on the story. This one pays too much attention on pleasing the fan base, and to explain every little irrelevant detail.That creates a problem, with so much to take into account there's not enough time to create context. To define the new characters and situations. Everything goes too fast, lacks anticipation.Also in the previous movies a big part of the enjoyment was the physicality of the fights. In this one everything is more brief, and more cinematic. You don't feel the fight as much.",7
5263,"Machines, guns, fight scenes and action were all missing... in fact, non existent. Who wrote this garbage. Instead we got shakey cam, shockingly edited to death fight scenes (neo getting his ass kicked) and empty plot holes.Forced nonsense. No passion. Neo didnt even pick up a weapon. The funniest bit, there was more tiffany screen time than trinity screen time.",2
5264,"I don't think it's as bad as said. At least a seven. Acting was okay, story a bit childish here and there, and too much confusing action. But the red thread was solid and the guys did a good job.",7
